JK Reviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.,My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.,A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.,Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.,Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.

  I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.,No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.,Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.

  I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

  Everyone says the new Apple Macbook with an M-1 chip is wonderful. However, I would say something different.,For the Macbook pro with an M1 chip, I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it's useless).,Secondly, would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface, the MacBook turns off itself. I don't know what happened but I'm pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.,Also, I miss the MagSafe...

Kurt Luce,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.,I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.,It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.,Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).,Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

  I love my new MacBook Pro!!  It’s the 13” and not too small. It’s very lightweight!  It’s so fast!  I was using an older MacBook Pro from mid 2012. It worked well, just so slow. This one flies!!  I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!

  The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.,The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.,How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.,Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.

  There is no fix for this, and now it can't be returned.  All that money wasted!!! There is a vertical black line on the screen.  I tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked.  Proceed with caution!

  I am an Apple guy. I converted from PC ~ 2008 and have loved every apple device until the IPhone X and the new Macbook with M1 chip. Where to start? First, as is a major complaint for everyone, the Macbook pro has all of two ports (yes yes, I know, this was listed in the specs. It doesn't make it ok). If I need to be plugged in, I have 1 port remaining. It is incredibly idiotic that I have to buy a dock to expand my ports. Oh and the ports are only Thunderbolt in Apple's continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage. I did not buy a Mac Air for a reason, yet the Macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an Air. The new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense. The track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless. I have no bluetooth connectivity. I get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music. I see zero performance improvements with the M1chip. In fact, doing a side-by-side video recording with Quicktime (all parameters equalized) I have a severe lag with M1 Mac, but not with the Intel driven machine. And the touch bar is about the worst idea ever. I constantly dim the back light, or go back on web pages because of it. Absolute trash. I bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns, because that's how terrible it is. I will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming Macbook Pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed.,So now begins the massive switching costs for foolishly demonstrating brand loyalty to a company who has none for its customers.

mkidwel2,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out.

  Update 8/10/21,A few updates now have made the pinwheel subside quite a bit, hope that future updates will make it go away for good.,Previous:,I constantly get the pinwheel when switching between programs I.E. Explorer, Outlook, Teams, amazon music, notes, etc. These are not high power requirement applications. It is especially bad when docking and undocking from my workstation.  I have my previous MacBook Pro setup exactly like this model and it powers through without issues. The problem has gotten so bad that I have momentarily switched back to my previous one until Apple gets the software figured out with some updates. Disappointing!

  So i got this item which was not working and had the camera going crazy with green lines all around. I asked amazon  for getting a working laptop for my interview and they said we dont replace items that are electronics which is weird since my friend faced similar issue and he got a working laptop. And due to all this i had to re-schedule my interview and the company said we will be moving on with other candidates this time.,Thank you AMAZON

Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had Windows based computers since day one. Always something going on with them. I’ve had at least 10 windows computers and decided it was time to try an Apple. Well I got to say I love this computer. A little bit of a learning curve but not a stumbling block. Don’t let the 13” fool you. It’s an awesome screen size and so sharp. I would recommend this computer to anyone.
"
J. Lopes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Coming from years and years of PC, I must say that this 13"" M1 Macbook Pro is an Internet beast. I also use it for Lightroom, Photoshop, Affinity suite, Capture One, FL Studio and I have zero complaints. I hadn't had a mac since the mid 90's and I was a huge fan then, but PC's just offer so much more for the money.,The ports are an issue and you will need to buy a dock like device because you'll need it to hookup older devices or more than two devices at some point.,GET THE 16GB model - While I have no issues with RAM so far, I believe the 16GB model should be the base model because the hibernation/sleep is going to kill the NAND hard drive eventually from writing to disk every time you close the lid.,There is an issue with the keyboard that I haven't been able to replicate, but the delete key will enter a state where it doesn't work, though the keyboard still functions. I have to close whatever window I'm typing in in order to get the delete key working again. It's not random, but I haven't figured out what two key combo is causing the problem or if it's just in twitter.,The screen is 100% accurate (close enough) out of the box - The reason I got the macbook pro is because of the issues I was having with my 15"" Dell XPS, which is a beast, color discrepancy when exporting. The colors were always over saturated and I had to guess what settings to use to counter the output. I did everything imaginable and always color calibrate with Spyder (for 10 years I've done this) but the accuracy was never the same on other screens, printing or web postings.,I never used the touch screen on the XPS. I hate smudged screens.,THE BATTERY LIFE is insane, as you've probably heard. 2 days, all day, no issues surfing the web at whatever levels are auto adjusted for on battery usage.,The touchpad - While really good, there are times when the two finger scrolling skips around, but overall, is a good experience.,I'm not a fan of the operating system at all, just like iOS, it's just too clunky and cluttered. Something odd coming from a company who builds incredible hardware with fantastic esthetic designs.

  I don't normally write reviews, but since I spent $1500 on this MacBook Pro M1 13"" from Amazon I have been very pleased. I have had it for less than a month and so far everything seems to be in perfect working order! I really love it to be honest., I was skeptical and a bit anxious about buying from Amazon instead of Apple directly, but I can say that there is no difference and it seems I got it $100 cheaper on Amazon and 2 day shipping. Just make sure it's sold and fulfilled by Amazon., All in all very pleased. For anyone on the fence about it you shouldn't be. Screen is bright, speakers are amazing, keyboard feels very nice, and battery is great!

Fnorgby,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  There are too many baffling oddball problems -- like it won't do portrait mode on a displayLink monitor.  It has problems with docking stations that ought to work just fine -- despite me turning off sleep and screen locking, when in clamshell closed mode, sometimes it won't wake up and has to be hard power-cycled or zapped to get it to boot back up.  These issues are virtually nonexistent on Intel silicon of the same era/OS revision level.  The problems with external monitors feel like they're reintroducing problems most vendors (INCLUDING APPLE) fixed over a decade ago.,I'm completely soured on M1, and have no interest in M1X.  I may trade this in for a Mini.  It's all but useless as portable computer because docking/undocking causes such nightmarish problems.,M2 maybe, once it's been out for a year or two.  Yes, I know that this is the risk of being an early-adopter.  I'm still going to call out its flaws even though I know I am the author of my own suffering here.,Also, again not an apple problem but a me problem:  I hate the touch bar and leave it completely disabled.  I'm clumsy and have big fingers.

Brittany,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I FINALLY, after years of my artist friends and colleagues using apple product (laptops, MacBooks, desktops) I decided I’d get one as I needed a new laptop since my previous one was 10 years old. At first, I was just sad for having spent so much. I thought “this better convince me otherwise”. After having this for two months, I can say I hate it.,Don’t get me wrong, there’s some decent features that add convenience, but I struggle to complete work in a timely manner as I have to constantly save or redo lost work. The MacBook can’t consistently run (for example) Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and one Google page. I know you’re probably thinking “maybe her file size of the projects she’s working on are bogging down a successful running speed and responsiveness.” That is not the case.,The work I am creating at this moment in time is basic web design, typographic studies of minor levels of file work, and an occasional image that needs photoshopped.,All in all, this product is a bit expensive for my liking. It’s got many decent aspects, such as a finger ID to unlock easily and touchscreen bar along the top of the keyboard display. Cool. But not worth $1,300 (after tax) if it is going to prohibit my work in graphic design.

Emanuel Boak,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I can't make this thing quit.  When I open more tabs, more videos, more music... Video editing and music making software with multiple tabs open while on a zoom call and watching youtube... It still doesn't skip a beat.. It does all of this while keeping a core temperature a third of the previous Intel based Macbook pro's.  Also not sure what its doing in there, but when I think my RAM is about to be all used up, I open up one more thing, and the RAM usage goes down..?!?!  So confused, but I love it!  The keyboard is amazing, as usual, and I actually enjoy the touch bar.  I have read and heard complaints or people saying the touch bar is useless, but I use it all the time when I am editing videos and music.  Even when I am messaging I love the emoji's are right there!  It's an amazing laptop, for $1199.00 it is totally worth it.  I did get an external SSD hard drive for more storage, but everything else is perfect.  8GB of unified RAM feels better than 16GB of normal RAM.  If you're torn on that, do not worry about the RAM, you would have to be a big time movie editor to slow this thing down, MAYBE.  Oh, and the battery life is crazy long!  I don't have to charge it at all in a days worth of everything I do with it.  And it's virtually noise free.  I was going to wait for the 2021 model, but they postponed the date, and also informed that the M1X chip is only going to be on the higher priced models, which I wouldn't be getting anyway cuz I'm not rich.  You will love this, push Buy Now and smile!

  For many people this will be a great and fast notebook. If you connect devices you need to know the ports are fast but can not supply very much power. If you have software on CD/DVD, be aware that your bus powered DVD drive probably will not work. Same if you attach external storage that needs more power than a newer SSD. To fix this you need a hub / dock that is externally powered and supplies power to any device plugged into the hub.

Sean,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's a Macbook Pro bro. What's there not to like. It's been 9yrs since my 2012 Macbook Pro purchase and I still use it. I just have to keep it plugged in because I can't find a good battery replacement for it. This M1 is much thinner. 😯 I would say half as thin as the 12 retina model.,Battery life seems good but it was good on my last one. I can use it all day. Button press trackpad even the touchbar is good. I do not understand the complaints about the touchbar. I find it kinda cool and ok. Maybe my opinion will change after some use.,The speed is what everyone raves about. I don't see it. It may be slightly faster but it's hard to tell just how much faster. When I open or load it doesn't seem super fast as everyone claims. I'm sure it's faster but it's not like its drastically noticeable.,I had one issue initially. I set up my fingerprint ID and all was fine until one day it didn't work and it asked me for my password. I could not remember my password and it took a whole day to figure out how to reset it. So far it's only happened once and I hope it doesn't happen again because using the fingerprint scanner I forgot my password already.😄,The audio is good. Definitely not tinny or hollow its that good quality audio you expect. Good full sound. Volume is ok too could maybe be a little louder.,I do not like that it has no ports. Just 2 usb C slots. 😐 You will have to buy an adapter. At least they kept the headphone jack. I also do not like clicking to drag n drop. I don't see any settings that I can change for this. I like being able to tap and 2 finger drag.,I was expecting this to be really fast because that's what they were bragging about but for the money I maybe should have got the air with more GB. But the camera and sound is better on this one. The screen doesn't look as HD as the retina model seems a little flat but it's good. Overall you know the quality of Apple. I will most likely always have a Macbook Pro. 😉👍

  I can't even believe that I am writing this review, but this is unprecedented. After just one week of using it, I want to get rid of it. This laptop is slower than my 2015 MacBook Pro 15 inc. All this hype about the M1 chip, and when I open 20 tabs on google chrome, it's game over, the laptop starts lagging, the sound cuts, I can't even move the mouse and of course, my favorite spinning apple colored wheel is spinning forever trying to load. My CPU is at a 100% this is not what you would expect from the latest apple models, and this is out of the box laptop

  This new MBP replaces my old 2011 machine. It is lighter, much faster, very quiet and the display is gorgeous! I didn’t think I would care for the Touch Bar but find myself really enjoying a feature not found on the new MacBook Air.,Transferring my images, music and data was simple and quick. If I had it to do over I would by a new M1 MBP.,I have heard a lot of negative comments because Apple didn’t change the physical appearance of the 2020 MBP. Personally, I am quite happy that it still looks like an Apple MBP.

   I was not disappointed as this was my first time buying a computer on Amazon, and here is why.,The ordering experience was much easier than my last visit to an Apple store to purchase a computer.  The computer arrived in two days, on time, a gift to our son who is heading to college.,This space grey laptop is the perfect size and weight when on campus. It includes an audio jack and two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports.,The package also includes a charger with a cord and a straightforward setup.,I like the fantastic Apple design of this laptop with the space grey casing.  I'm glad overall that this laptop will last up to 20 hours on a charge, has a great screen, and is more than the required memory and speed as requested by the University. Simply perfect and well worth it.  Therefore I rate this product five out of five stars.

Panamax,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  this is a M1 model - It is fast, it is light, it is powerful, it wakes up in seconds..... it saves me time like crazy, no longer the annoying ball.... - it replaces my old and faithful MacBook Pro late 2013 (yes! 2013) - everything works from the beginning..... in my older Mac (which I still keep just in case) I could still run everything I needed, but it was definitely much slower - the new one is great - take the op to say KUDOS to Apple! until 10 days ago I was still using a 7 years old computer, running Big Sur and every single app I needed and the only change, has been one of speed (great change by the way) - all is compatible, I just put in a CalDigit dock and do not need to buy anything else new..... - well done!

  I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.

Paul K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Liked:,- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true),- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast),- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot),- Light and portable,- High resolution & bright display,Disliked:,- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad,- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon

  UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!,Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.,The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.,Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.,***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.,I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.,There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.,***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.,------,I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.,The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.,I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.,I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.,I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.

  The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one.

  Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.

  I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.,Good:,- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.,- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.,- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.,- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.,- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.,- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.,- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.,- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.,- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.,NOT GOOD:,- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).,- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.,- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.,- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.,OVERALL:,A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!

  No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.

  Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.,However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.,I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.,UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:,1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.,2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).,  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.,  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.,I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.,IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!

  Looked forward to this new MacBook Air.  Loved the Magic Keyboard, but everything else seems half-baked Apple.,I didn't know enough to immerse myself in the (hard-to-find)  Essentials Manual before touching the FORCE touchpad.  Took a long time that to realize that ""force""  really meant FORCE (as in ""smash it down"" )  There is a System Preferences bypass, but I got embroiled in a DARK MODE display (black screen), missing cursor, and of course loss of Intel-chip based favorite apps which all took precedence over trying to find and read a possible Manual.  Help menu did not help..,I tried, I really did.  Apple Support suggested and helped for 2 days, with hours spent trying over & over to erase, then Reinstall Big Sur  software, but 2 hours loading (for each of dozens of tries), then ""An error occurred preparing this update.  Please try again.""was too much, over and over.  This software is not ready for primetime.  Looking forward to AIR's next iteration.,Meanwhile, I must be content with my older MacBook Pro, while MacBoo Air is returned:  ""rest in peace"".

   Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.,I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.,I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂,I have no problems with it at all.,Highly recommend

  I am a long-time windows user. I've had so many different windows laptops, each with their own faults. I've always despised MacBooks because of what you hear from every person who's built a pc before: ""Apple makes crappy products!!! No good to use!!!!"". Ever since I got my iPad Pro a few years back, Apple has slowly dragged me back into the ecosystem by how good their products have become. With the release of the M1 macs, I was pretty interested in how well these will perform, and eventually caved and bought this MacBook Pro.,I was wrong. I've been wrong. This MacBook Pro has very good performance and has kicked ass through everything I throw at it. I like the Big Sur operating system, everything has been made super easy, and also connects to all of my other Apple devices. Being able to to text people from my MacBook is awesome. My only complaint is honestly, like everyone else, the Touch Bar. I wish I had the regular function keys like on the air. I got this one because of better battery life, and man. This laptop lasts me a WEEK. What???? My ol reliable acer laptop only lasted me 8 hours, and I thought that was good.,Sorry windows fanboys. Sorry pc master race. For laptops (I will never replace my home windows desktop), the MacBook is one of the best devices you can buy. It's great.

Anonymous Reviewer Dude,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this for $1099, which it's $1299 if you buy it from Apple, which makes no sense!  It was either this or the Macbook Air for $899 (which is $999 at Apple).  I got this because I've had many Macbook Airs and wanted something different.  If I had to do it again, and wanted to save money I would have gotten the Air.  The difference is this has a fan, a touch bar, a better gpu, and a brighter screen for $200 more.  I was worried because some people don't like the touch bar but I think it's great!  And besides, you can even set the touch bar up so it's just like the old function keys you're used to, but as touch keys.,There really is no competition for a Macbook.  I've tried them all, the Dells, the Surfacebooks, etc, and they're never as good as an Apple Macbook.

  I was excited to get the new macbook pro M1 as reviews described it as a very fast powerhouse computer. My first impression was strong. I started to play with all the features my old MacBook Pro is missing. I was excited about extending the screen to my iPad pro will be able to paint in photoshop (with Sidecar). This feature is completely underwhelming and unpractical to use (mostly due to how interface of this feature is set up). The next feature I was excited to try was installing iPad/iPhone app to MacBook Pro... Well, this works here and there, applications are crashing... again very underwhelming. Three weeks later my new MacBook Pro started having issues when plugging into the power source through thunderbolt. After I unplug it from power, the second time when plugin it wouldn't charge. I had to unplug the thunderbolt cable both from the power adapter and from a computer and plug it back to the charger first then to the computer in order for mac to charge again. I ran self-diagnostic on startup and it would freeze. Luckily I was still in the Amazon window to return this now broken computer. I don't understand how Apple machines became so unreliable. Now I'm hesitant to order another Apple computer as this is the very first new computer I ever purchased turns out to be a lemon.

  I was nervous buying a Macbook over Amazon, but the delivery was fast and required a signature. I have needed a new Macbook because I bought mine over five years ago. It is a nice computer and way faster than my old one. I was curious about the new M1 chip in the Macbook. It is a great purchase for the price since Macbooks last so long. Highly recommend.

Alayahk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love my MacBook Pro! I had the 13 inch macbook air 2017 and I hated that thing, used it for college and i wanted to get rid of it so bad so i gave it away. I always wanted the macbook pro because i thought they were just built better and i the interface of how its designed looked way better. Finally was able to buy one and so far so good. I really hope and pray this one doesn't start going slow like how my macbook air did after a year or 2. Bought one for my friend as well and she loves hers. I mainly use it for work, school/zoom calls and a little bit of streaming. Not a gamer so battery life is something i never have to worry about. Battery life was amazing for the first 2 weeks but  I can tell now the battery has been dying slightly faster but i believe it's from how much i've been on it lately but if i put it down for a few days (most likely 2) battery life hangs in there.

  Apple hit it out of the park with the new M1 chip. It outperforms I7 laptop from a year ago by a long shot. Plus outperforms most while having a over 12 hour battery life. I not no Apple fan, but this laptop is great. Plus they finally got rid of the dreaded butterfly keyboard that would fail even when we’ll taken care of and when back to the older but mature scissor keyboard design. The screen is accurate, if your looking to upgrade. This is the one to get, or even go with the base model with out touch bar and still will outperform the intel macs and other laptops, while having the best power management on any laptop seen to date, while at a finally reasonable price.

  Battery life and new keyboard if nice but this mac freezes a lot. When you open more than 10 tabs, when open finder, when connecting to external monitor this m1 freezes I need to constantly force quit the applications. This Macbook ""pro"" only ""supports"" one external monitor. Not a reliable laptop.
"
Patrick Walsh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I left my brand new M1 Macbook pro in my car for an hour and now the screen looks like a Picasso painting.  Both Amazon and Apple refuse to pay for repairs because apparently this is considered an accident rather than a manufacturer's defect, even though I bought it only two months ago.  So I'm out $700 to repair a two month old computer.  I would heavily advise against buying one of these, because if this is considered normal rather than a manufacturer's defect, then 80 degree heat is enough to damage the screen.  This means that they're essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer.

Steven James DeBlasi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my very first Mac. It was the value for the price (strange to describe an Apple product that way) and the performance of Apple's new M1 chip that finally compelled me to buy my first Mac. And I'm glad I did. This machine is awesome. It's my baby now. It's so good! Part of it no doubt is the novelty is using MacOS instead of Windows 10, but I really love my new MacBook Pro!

Brian S in DC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've been an Apple user for over 35 years, and I was pretty excited to make the M1 migration now that many apps have been updated for Apple Silicon. I expected to be blown away, and while this is an excellent Apple laptop, and the battery life does live up to the hype, I overall I found it disappointing compared to the reviews. Three things:,1. Sure, it may fly if you're doing really CPU heavy things, but for things like ""heavy"" productivity, I found it no better than my Intel 16"". In fact....,2. This could be related to all the stories I read saying, ""8GB on Apple Silicon is like 16GB on Intel.""  Yeah, don't believe those. Again, this may be true for tasks that are well suited for ARM, but heavy productivity work is no better. I keep a decent but not insane amount of Safari tabs open at any time, and that plus having much of anything else open kept the memory pressure graph constantly in the yellow, if not red. And that may or may not be related to the biggest problem which is....,3. I had significant problems using my LG 5K display which has worked like a champ with my 16"". Sometimes it would take up to 4 minutes before things ""settled down"" and I was actually able to use the computer again. That was a dealbreaker.,Would 2 and 3 have been better with more memory, or are these M1 growing pains, or something else? I don't know. I'll probably give the 16"" a try with 16GB whenever it comes out. For now, this 13"" was just too underpowered for my fairly average professional needs.,I realize that reviews below 5 stars on this are rare, which I find puzzling for the reasons above. Hope this is helpful to anyone who might be wondering about the downsides.

  I love my MBP! As a Windows user since the early 90's, I've gone through all sorts of computer systems; desktops and laptops, name-brand pre-built systems and custom builds and I've got to say, Apple knows how to construct an absolutely gorgeous and solid device with premium build quality. My interest in Windows began waning after Windows 7 and has been a downward spiral since, in terms of user experience, maintenance, bugs, endless updates, updates for those updates, etc. I was not going to stick around for another lackluster release with Windows 11 on the way (which my fairly new and high-end laptop at the time didn't even officially qualify for the upgrade). The learning curve was not too steep and has been more rewarding in the past several weeks of use. I forget how much of a pleasure it was to use a computer that the developers actually understand the needs of the customer base. I am equally amazed by just how seamlessly everything just seems to work. I used to think in terms of Apple monopolizing the market by offering a product that they built both on the hardware and software side, but that is in part why it just works so flawlessly.

  Starting in the early 2000's I became a strictly Apple girl for all electronic devices. I love the easy integration between devices and as a person with a disability it means a lot to have that interconnect-ability. I previously had a Macbook Pro from 2015 and it was malfunctioning badly. The replacement cost exceeded its value so invested that repair cost into this Macbook Pro. it's come a long way since 2015! I love how light weight it is, I swear it's lighter than my Macbook Air from 2010 was. I like the touch display but I mainly only use it for emojis 🙂. I had Big Sur on my previous Mac but it ran slow. This Macbook works so much faster than what I had before. The screen is brilliant and gorgeous. I had read this Macbook could run any app on my phone. The reality is it's only a few apps. What I wanted to work the most was Instagram, and that does not work on this. There are several apps though and that's a nice feature.,I'm not techie from a hardware position but I am an advanced user from a software perspective and I am really happy with this this.

  I am a big fan of MacBooks. This was my fourth one in the past 10 years.  This one was a LEMON. It worked fine at first but began to freeze on booting. Called Apple three times and walked thorough reloading the IOS and erasing the entire system to reinstall. It then went black screen. Took it to the Apple store and was told in two minutes to send it back.  Tried to exchange it for another but apparently you don't have more in stock. Still a fan but sometimes you get a LEMON and are unable to make lemonade.

  I wanted a new MacBook since it's been several years since I got my last Mac and the battery was going bad.,With a delicious gold color and an overall thin, sleek design, this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more ""fancy"" than other options on the market.,With the M1 chip, everything is extremely fast. I was able to set up this new machine with 10 minutes.,I am not sure if I would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a Mac (2017 to now) but if it's been several years and you want to splurge, go for this.,As a writer, the keyboard is so smooth and I feel like I can type more words per minute on this machine.,My only complaint is the webcam, while better, is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market. FaceTime looks a bit grainy still and Photo Booth is just a joke. The quality barely looks different than recent models.,Overall, this is a great addition to the Mac family. I look forward to see how Apple utilizes the M1 chip in the future.,83/100

  I jumped out of the “Ecosystem” a little while back. Last had a MacBook Pro 13” in about 2015 when we had real ports. I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife. But I’ve been underwhelmed with Apples offerings for a minute.,When I started reading up and watching vids on the new M1 I was sold. I’m all in now. This Air is an absolute unit of a machine. I really see no reason for anyone to get the Pro, unless you’re getting the soon to be released updated 16” pro. This bad boy will do all that most people need.,Let me say first off, the battery life is phenomenal. I can take it on the go and use it all day with no issues at all. I didn’t even pack my charger with me today. I can carry it in a simple sleeve and I’m good to go. Plus it’s lighter than the pro as well.,Performance is spectacular. It runs circles around anything else I have that’s windows based. In testing, I’ve seen it surpass or hold its own, against prior MacBook Pro models. Even those with dedicated graphics.,For the majority of people, this is going to be their go to laptop. What you get for an entry level Mac is stellar. This is my recommendation for anyone outside of a hardcore video/photo editor. But even then, in a pinch it will get the job done.

  I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.,I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.,I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.,the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.,I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.,The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.,The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.,One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.,Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple.

It took over an hour to get Amazon to accept the return and ship me a replacement.  Next morning get MacBook number 2- super excited because I open it and it comes on and sings a song! Loved it for the 3 hours it worked.  It updated and Locked me out.  Did everything they told me to do online, call Apple that admits they are having this issue and I can return it for another one! Since it’s not 14 days old.  No thanks.  I am done.  Since Apple told me to return it this time Amazon was amazing and is picking it up for return tomorrow.  This was a crappy experience.

It's neither fast, nor large, by today's standards, but it is solid, light, and robust with Apple's latest release.  It'll last for years.,No way to connect Apple's top products:  Mac Air and iPhone.  I guess I need more cables.  Please, sir, take more of my money.

  I purchased the MacBook Air to replace a 4th Gen Surface Pro that was down to about 30 minutes of battery life.  I purchased an Intel Mac Mini about six months ago and was intrigued by recent news articles regarding the M1 chip.  I'm thrilled with the added battery life on the new device and amazed by the speed difference between my Intel-based mini vs. the M1.  Out of the box, adding a full charge, the new Mac estimates 19+ hours of battery life.  I've been using the computer for three hours, four open apps, and have bumped the battery gauge to 98%.  Think I've eliminated battery anxiety.  App launches are two to three times faster on the Air vs. my Mini.  The new laptop is zippy!  I'm thrilled with my new laptop and look forward to many years together.

St8kout,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Update:,I saw some reviews that said their 3rd party usb hub broke their Mac. I've been using a usb-c to usb-a for a few weeks now with no problems (made by UNI). It's worked for everything I threw at it; Logitech G910 keyboard, Razor mouse, Yamaha digital piano, RME Audio Interface, Roland A-49 midi keyboard. They all worked. I also have a cheapo Amazon Basics single usb adaptor cord about 6"" long, and it too works with everything on the MacBook.,After decades of looking through Bill Gates' Windows, I bought my first Mac but only because of the new M1 chip, where everything is on this one chip, which makes it faster. Applications optimized for the M1 now rival high end PCs (and for the first time too). I never was interested in Macs because they were overpriced and underpowered, but it looks like that worm has turned. Just don't buy an earlier version of Macs, especially with Intel chips.,Keep in mind when/if you buy this, there are NO upgrades later on; ZERO, NADA, nothing to change out. You can't add RAM nor Storage once it's built. (There is a workaround on storage, by adding an external SSD drive, but as I understand it there are some problems viewing what is on your external drive, but that may change over time.),Also, SSD storage, while blazingly fast and so worth it, need about 10% 'headroom.' That is for example, if you have 256GB storage, you can only use 230GB as you need a 10% reserve to account for SSDs getting used up. It's the nature of the beast. And of course the preinstalled software also takes up storage space from day one. For my PC I bought a 250GB SSD and found that it was maxing out pretty fast, so I replaced with a 1TB SSD and have already filled up half of it, but I don't expect to fill it up completely anytime soon. It should be good for maybe a decade or so.,So bottom line, get at least the 512GB storage or you'll be sorry. It does kind of suck that Apple charges so much for each step increase in storage, but paying the extra $200 in this case is worth it, IMHO. The jury is still out on if you need 16BG of RAM vs the 8GB models currently in stock, (Apple treats it like a custom order at this time, with a waiting period.)  If it was a PC, then getting 16GB RAM is a no-brainer, but in the case of the M1 chip, it shares memory within the chip, making the most use of it. I have 32GB in my PC because RAM sticks are relatively cheap.,Remember, once you buy a MacBook, it will stay as is. Upgrades are impossible (which has always been the case for notebooks anyway).

  My laptop lasted less than 4 months before it died. I talked to an Amazon rep who was responsive and put me in touch with an Apple rep, who was curt. He suggested bringing it to a local shop licensed by Apple to diagnose and repair, but he said they didn't have an appointment for almost a week. At the shop, they were much more responsive but warned that a small crack in the bottom of the screen that happened when I close it one day likely caused the problem, would not be covered by the warranty and would cost $700 to fix. (Fingers crossed it is something else, but he said he was 95 percent sure this would be the case.) Two issues with my 2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage): 1) Debris can fall into the seam between the keyboard and screen unseen and 2) I kept having to adjust the brightness; even though I set the screen to be bright, it kept returning to dim. My other complaint is that the Apple rep was curt. The tech at the shop said he sees a lot of screen issues and highly recommended by the warranty-plus plan, which costs over $200, for two years, I think, and then $100/year.

  I have an aging MacBook Pro (15"") which I use a great deal. At some point I know it will cease to function well, so I made the leap to the smaller 2020 MacBook Pro (13"") with the M1 chip. It runs fast, stays cool, and after a month or so of pretty constant usage, has been doing beautifully. Some of the newer features like the touch screen pad have taken me some time to get used to, but I'm learning to appreciate them. A word of caution...not all apps and software are quite ready for the M1 chip / Big Sur yet. I'm still straddling the world of two MacBooks, the older one running High Sierra and the new one running Big Sur, because some of the apps don't work perfectly on the new MacBook. But all in all, it's a good transition for me.

  Good MacBook. I owned a 2013 prior to this and vowed to get macbooks for their superior performance.,I rated this a 4 because I had some eye strain which was of great irritance. However I just turned off the True Colors and changed the background to a softer color. Problem solved.,I also didn't appreciate that now it uses a USB-C type dock. So now I have to get new adapters and wires to connect it's Thunderbolt 3 to other devices).  It took me a good three weeks to figure everything out.,Despite this I love the sound and picture quality. The touch bar is cool too.,** UPDATE after 3 months of use,I can't handle the heavy eye fatigue caused from this new macbook. To be honest, I think my vision got worst after using this mac.  I'm a teacher, so I must look at my screen a lot.  Comparing it to another macbook that I owned (a MacBook pro 2013 which I got replaced with this M1), I got very little eye fatigue from it.  Also the design doesn't work if you add a case to it.  A case would prevent you to effectively use the USB c ports as the bottom part of a case would interfere with it.

   On the right hand side you can see a black line of dead pixels that quickly became much worse. And although it was on every window you can really see it on the graph where the image burned into the 3 week old screen that I barely used and bought specifically because it was considered the best option for trading view the program in the video. You can see. Facebook logo burnt in on the right but the whole screen was ghosting everything bad.  It’s just hard to see most of it. I have no idea what caused this. As it’s not a 20 year old crt display with an nes left on for years. It’s a brand new Liquid Retina I’m sure I’m not the only one to experience this but do keep in mind I was lucky and able to return because this happened one day before my 30 day window closed. My experience with apple has always been with second market items aside from my phone they are not very helpful unless you pay  a very high service fee. I’m sure I could have had this repaired for free but at the price and the fact that it was my very first Mac I sent it back and have no intention on owning another one. Best thing I could suggest is if you must own a Mack buy apple care they will replace  it twice brand new. U may need that done. The build quality outside of the electronics is unmatched. Absolute perfection in every seam. I wish it would have worked I bolutely loved this machine until the day it broke down. Now I won’t ever feel comfortable owning a new one again. I did purchase the m1 iPad instead and love it. Well my 2tb model. The 128 is not enough storage 2tb I’m sure will be plenty. I think apple is a great product as long u never have any issues. If you do be ready to spend like you did the day you made your purchase.

  I am extremely disappointed with this machine. I bought this specifically because it had a GPU, which I thought would be beneficial for programming with data. However, the new Apple Chip is completely unworkable. None of the modern software packages for data science are compatible with the chip, rendering the machine worthless and void for its intended purpose. I will never purchase another Apple machine.

  I’ve been a lifelong user of Windows PC and Linux. Until Big Sur and the M1 chip came out I’ve been hesitant to try Macs, so I first got my toes wet by getting an iPhone 12 earlier this year (also a long time Android user). Having used an iPhone for over 6 months now and being very pleased by its performance I felt encouraged to try one of these new MacBooks, and let me tell you, it did not let me down.,I think the level of thinking and detail that went into designing this device is out of this world. You have to give credit where credit is due: this is the most well designed high performance laptop I’ve ever used.,10/10 would recommend.

Puru,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased this laptop because my previous laptop (a behemoth of a gaming laptop) broke suddenly broke down. It was great, except for the fact that it felt a little slow. Maybe it is because I had downgraded from a 144hz screen to a 60hz screen, or maybe because my previous laptop was a performance monster, it just didn't feel that good. However, other than that, it is an amazing laptop. Very portable, and doesn't really heat up that much. Also, it charges super fast, therefore I could charge it for 30 min to 1 hour in the morning and go the the whole day without having to worry about charging it. Overall, it is an amazing product, however, it wasn't the one for me.

  I purchased this laptop and it dropped, but not a hard drop and the screen broke. We had to replace it and did so with an original screen. It got hit again, not hard (I swear!) and it broke again. I've never had a laptop that's as fragile as this one.

  La compré en abril, pero la comencé a usar recién en mayo 2021. A comienzos de setiembre comenzó a fallar el touchbar y ese mismo día se apagó y no volvió a encender.,El servicio técnico dice que es un fallo eléctrico y tendrán que cambiar varias partes, incluyendo la batería, el touch bar, el teclado, etc. Es decir, una computadora de casi 1500 requiere un mantenimiento bastante grande luego de solo 4 meses de uso.,Me parece bastante mal. Obviamente, desde donde estoy es imposible comunicarse directamente con la empresa. La página web dice que siempre está ocupada y el servicio técnico hace que los clientes firmen un documento que, básicamente, sirve para que no haya opción a reclamar. Es más, si no dejo que la reparen, estoy obligado a pagarles por el diagnóstico.,No puedo recomendar un producto tan caro que se estropee tan rápido.

So futuristic and cool to navigate from like a space ship 🚀 I can totally see apple doing an option for all touch screen keyboard………….

  The Apple MacBook Pro looks great and, based on all the reviews, it probably is.  However, as a 71 year old man, accustomed to using Windows for the past 12 years, this new MacBook Pro was very different.  The part of it that really makes me angry is the fact that it came with NO INSTRUCTIONS.  I need something to look at and do things, step by step.  It started off with a Voice tutorial thing that was as confusing and ridiculous as anything I've ever seen.  Trying to access the ""guide"" on my cell phone while trying to set up this MacBook was as frustrating as anything I've ever attempted.  For a big company, like Apple, to fail so miserably at KEEPING IT SIMPLE, is a horrible error.  I will struggle through this but I'm not happy about how difficult this is for me.  Some clearly written instructions, included with the machine, would have been nice.

Clarkb286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The performance of this machine (CPU, memory, SSD, and GPU speed) is outstanding. The battery lasts over 10x longer than my previous laptop, a Lenovo Thinkpad T490. The display is bright (500 nits) and beautiful. The laptop is ultra-portable, weighing less than 3 lbs. Either the cooling fans on this laptop are so quiet that they're inaudible, or else they've never come on! macOS Big Sur is intuitive and feature-rich, and the fact that the OS is based on Unix makes software development a delight. The only criticism that I have with this machine is that it only has 2 Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports; an external USB-C hub/adapter/dongle is required if one needs HDMI, USB-A, Ethernet, SDHC, DisplayPort, or VGA connectivity. The price / performance of the M1 MacBook Pro is hard to beat!

  A nice, lightweight computer with beautiful screen and nice sounding audio speakers. Battery life is awesome.,Only negatives are:,1.

  The Touch Bar on this Mac book makes writing so much easier. It has predictive text and know what you’re trying to say. It saves passwords by your fingerprint. If you are an Apple person like me you can unlock your max book from your Apple Watch. The battery life on this is amazing. I’m on it hours at a time and hardly ever have to charge it. Great Apple product.,Keeps my life on track as I’m a busy teacher and parent and travel for my other job!

  I was impressed that there was no lagging when photo editing it.  I switched from PC to Apple which might take some adjustment.  If you’re like me,  I recommend that you watch some YouTube videos on some handy tips.,The only thing that irritated me was that the package was left on the doorstep for hours.  Nobody signed for it.  I shuddered to think what might happened if it got stolen. Definitely worth investing Nest or Ring door bell even if nothing got stolen.

WSSizer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had the new M1 MacBook Pro for several months now, and I have to say that it lives up to all of the superlative reviews it received. As expected, the most noticeable improvement is its speed, which is in another league from my 2012 Mac. Battery life is excellent, and the automatic day/night screen change works very well. Although some prefer the standard control bar on the MacBook Air, I think the automatic control bar on the new Pro is really neat. I also like the larger touch pad on the Pro vs the one on the Air. All things considered, the new MacBook Pro is a great value, especially at the Amazon sale price.

Great investment for my book writing and finances.,Definitely a major upgrade from my HP.,Now I wasn’t sure who to contact about delivery or where to write it but I don’t appreciate having told them I want someone to sign for it being it is a high value priced item and it was just thrown on my porch and I wasn’t notified at all then when I go look it says it was directly handed to me.

  I put this along side my £3,500 13” MacBook Pro (2019), which was spec’d up to the max, and the M1 Air wiped the floor with it. Twice as fast encoding the same video, making my top of the line Intel MacBook Pro instantly obsolete. You can not go wrong with this purchase. This is the biggest evolutionary leap in desktop computing since the early 00’s. I’m just upset I bought this as a gift for someone else.

S. Vreeland,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If I could go back I probably would though past the time now.,I'd say I'm computer savvy, spent years of time on windows programs, photoshop etc. Now that my current Dell Inspiron is reaching the end of its life, I followed all the great reviews and purchased this MacBook Air M1.,Everything is hard. I actually loved my Dell in many ways, though hopefully its life, around 4-5 years, is about half what this Mac will be.,Things I'm missing the most so far, a touch screen, the ability to fully open ie fold-back and flatten the rotation the screen, even the fact of needing to use 3 fingers to take screen-shots instead of an allocated button, the delete button is actually a back-space not delete button. Notifications keep coming in upper right corner, blocking what I might want to access there. One needs to go through each app to change the setting btw, there's no default to say do not show notifications. It would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up. I much prefer chrome to safari, though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power. I downloaded Flotata this morning which is supposed to help though I haven't tried yet. Incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited, trying to figure things out!! Have spent hours on calls with Apple support which thankfully is very accessible. But my computer seems glitchy, sometimes the screen-sharing doesn't work. I haven't purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding ""right-clicking"" with 2 finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as I'd expect it to.,Overall unfortunately not a happy camper. Maybe for Mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason.,I was also very torn whether to get the 8 or 16gb, I went with the 8. I don't think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new.,I also tried to have my teen daughter, who's used to Macs, give me tips though she was't terribly helpful so I watched a couple of YouTube vids which gave some guidance, things are not intuitive.,I don't like posting negative reviews, though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done, while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine, may find this helpful.,Also as an fyi, I had to pay an additional nearly $300 to have my 2 external hard-drives transferred onto a new Mac compatible one, so I can access all my previous work.,Wishing everyone better luck!
"
AJ ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Im sure its amazing for die hard Mac users. However, the one port is a non starter for me. I opened it started it up and one I realized I had to buy accessories to add anything additional, I cleaned it and packed back up to return. One port is horribly inconvenient for my needs, and having to carry around an accessory to add even one more is a waste of my energy. I can and will purchase something more adaptable and suited to my needs
"
Do not know why they are requiring a pen name,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Buying into the Apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money, but, do not make them a critical part of your workflow.  They are too expensive for that.  Apple just does not make good computers.  Yes, they make a OK operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in.,You can't just go and buy the parts to fix your Mac computers when they break.  The MacBook Air is no exception to this.  The SSD is solider to the motherboard.  Likewise the RAM.  Now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe.  But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air.  (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.),Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output.  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old.  This is unacceptable.  Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.,Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM.  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.),Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  Would I buy one again? Perhaps -- it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of it.,The good things:,Keyboard, touchpad, Built-In Screen, Build-In Speakers, Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows, and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows.  Also, comes with a Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Program -- now, it is better just to use something really Libre -- like LibreOffice.  But, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for Microsoft Windows.

  I needed a new computer desperately, (screen broke and volume malfunctioned on my beloved old Asus transformer), so after much research about Macs online, I ordered a new MacBook Air. Most of the online reviews and info praised it except for the camera, and in this current pandemic Zoom world, that was a must!  However, I couldn't imagine a new apple  computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!,The sound and yes, the camera, are phenomenal! I can only assume the bad camera reviews were made by video bloggers that need extreme HD resolution. I just do average work on my computer, so no problem there! I am thoroughly enjoying surfing online, streaming videos, and Zooming with great clarity. I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was. If I had read my review or one similar to it, it would have eased my mind. So, unless you're a vlogger , fear not!,It's a fantastic computer in every sense of the word! (Not to mention the $999 price for a new Mac!) Get it!!! You won't regret it! The rose gold is especially pretty!

  this is my 3rd Macbook pro.  and each time it gets better.  Much thinner than my previous one, and very light weight.  the only thing I don't like is that it only has the USB c, which doesn't allow charging of other devices.  I had to go and get the adaptor for an additional $20.  Also they don't include the extension cord anymore, which I don't mind, since I already have 2 that came with the other ones.

  I purchased this for my 4yo daughter's online classes so it definitely did not disappoint. She uses Zoom an Google Classroom and these programs work flawlessly on a MBP M1. We do not plan on doing heavy tasks on this laptop, just the basic browsing, social media, video calls and online school stuff. It's pretty fast, but I find that our 2014 16"" MBP retina to be the same. The battery lasts FOR DAAAAAYYYYSSSSS. A full charge lasted 4 days w/ 3 hours of daily use. Quite impressed! I know how sturdy MBP's are with our 2013 and 2014 MBP's still alive and working well, so I know I'll get our money's worth with this laptop.,TLDR: Lightweight, battery for days, super fast, apps and programs work seamlessly for students.

  I actually loved this except for the lack of a touch screen.  I ended up returning because of it.

  This is honestly an excellent machine.,Not even interested in discussing ""cons"" because there aren't any if you  weigh up the price point fairly for what is arguably the best ultra portable laptop on the market right now (July 21') and I don't mean the fastest.,The ""only two"" thunderbolt slots can be dongled out to the max. If you want a second or third monitor setup, get any ""display-link"" certified hub like the Dell 452-BCYT D6000 Universal Dock (pricey) or the WAVLINK USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station,USB C to 5K/ Dual 4K @60Hz Video (cheaper).,The 7 cores of GPU on this model won't be noticed vs 8 cores. The machine is a beast. I'm using Lumafusion to process video (not even designed for MacOS but ports across from iPadOS) and it's 3X as fast as the iPad Pro that I own - 2019,Best laptop I've ever owned and I've owned two earlier MacBook pro's, a Mac mini, several windows laptops, and the Dell S2721Q 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor I purchased here is parked on top of the last windows machine I purchased.,The 4K dell monitor is easily crisp enough for MacOS and I purchased the keyboard used and Magic Mouse (2) new, on Amazon.,It's been a while since I've been on MacOS and would describe it as wonderful to use and look at, after coming from windows 10. Sidecar is also amazing (using the iPad Pro to the right for that),If you're shopping for a laptop or a Mac laptop, this is a good option.,You'll love it. Nuff said.

  I have used Microsoft Windows based computers 100% since 1985.  Now for the 1st time I decided to try Apple out instead to see how Windows compares to a MacBook.  Only been a few days and I already see things unfamiliar I am learning. So far...I have to say the speed of the new M1 processor compared to any of the Windows 10 computers is very impressive and just the speed and ""faster response"" the MacBook seems to have combined with the programs I have downloaded and a few I purchased I would have to say I prefer the MacBook.  I added a 7 port USB hub and a trackball I use instead of the built in pad but other then that I have not changed a thing.  It definitely does everything I need it to do both business related an for pleasure.  I also enjoy the small portable size and will be taking it on it's first trip in just a few days.  If anyone is a current Windows user and is considering the switch to try out a MacBook I would say go for it and do not look back....If you purchase one and later decide you would prefer not to stick with it a MacBook seems to hold their value much better then the majority of Windows based computers out there.

  Computer is lightweight and fast but... right out of the box I had a service battery notice. Charged it up and it was still there. Made an appointment with the nearest Apple store (20 miles away). They confirmed my Mac was made this month so it was brand new but they can’t replace it since it was bought from Amazon and not Apple. They sent it out for a new battery under warranty which was to take 3-5 days and they have had it a week now and haven’t completed the repair yet. All around not a good experience for my first Mac and spending a thousand bucks on a laptop. I’ll be going back to pc after this.

  Pros,Works,No fan - super quiet,Screen resolution decent and looks good from most angles,super-fast response time during use,wakes up from sleep instantly,looks nice (for a laptop),not super heavy,If you check your email, listen to Spotify, shop online (Amazon), web browse, watch Youtube videos, Zoom calls, work with Apple Photos, look at PDF's, Use Google Docs/spreadsheets - this is a great laptop,Cons,Some software is not compatible or has problems with the M1 Apple CPU ( not that I've experienced but this might impact you),No Built-in cam cover for $1000+ laptop - and according to apple if you use your own you can damage your screen - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211148,When you open the laptop unless you're super careful you smudge the laptop camera/that general area - that or you open it from the sides,no LED light indicator for if the laptop is on, sleep mode, charging, fully charged,charging seems kinda slow,they removed the keyboard brightness physical buttons - but you can pin this in the top-right menu bar or and it's in the control center,side note OS,On the login screen of Big Sur, you can see the battery icon but not the exact percentage you have left - have to log in for that,still have to manually turn on ""show thousand separators"" on the calculator app

  I love this little computer! When I was looking for a laptop to buy, I almost went with a used, older MacBook Air. I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone.

  I left the Apple product line years ago due to their practice of ""forced obsolesce"" with early iPhone models. Having worked in IT for most of my career I like being able to have full control of my device. Apple mostly locks up their devices.,But, I decided to give the MacBook Air 2020 a chance because: 1. my MS Surface didn't last long enough for the money and it, too, is hardware locked and 2. I was impressed with the M1 specification.,After playing with this machine I have to say the M1 is AWESOME! The screen response is shockingly quick in comparison to other PCs and Apple devices.,I highly recommend ONLY buying an Apple device WITH a M1 processor.

  The camera is not really current. Especially for a laptop in this price range. It’s not much, if any, better than the toshiba laptop I got at Walmart for $400 back in like 2010. It is actually fine for me because I don’t rely on it for work or anything. But if you rely on it for virtual meetings, FaceTime, zoom, etc, you will be disappointed in the camera quality. I have very little need for the camera so it doesn’t bother me personally. But the camera is absolutely embarrassing for what has been named the laptop of the year by many, and I would agree, it’s a great computer. Great battery life, super fast charging, very light, not quiet—silent. Quiet implies there is a minimal amount of noise. There is no fan in this and it’s is literally silent. No noise at all, at any level that I can discern. Really fast. Best laptop I’ve ever had for sure.

  I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple. It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer. I have been an Apple fan for several years now and so use to it that I have great difficulty when trying to use a Window's based computer.

  i am a windows man way back 40 yrs.  since i used windows software for work i saw no reason to switch to apple.  although i did have an apple  IIc for fun way back in the early pc days,My surface pro entry model has been around for many yrs and the battery has run down and mostly i use it plugged in. I decided to try a mac to learn something new. After research i decided to get the mac air m1 w 8GB ram and the 512GB SSD - this is what i learned ( not going into why i decided what i did as anyone can do the same research,1. setup and initial use was not as easy as advertised,- couldnt get past the country selection and found after search many had same problem. almost returned it but i finally found i could move selection by tab key AND selection based on space press and  NOT return key - track pad was useless - ( it had a little to do with track pad setup that can only be performed later as well as track pad difference from MS product) .,windows and track pad usage not same as windows and i couldn't resize screen windows or even drag them on the screen -,plenty of tutorials on you tube - but none really helped decipher selection until i figured it out watching an excel tutorial on how to select and drag cells - you have to ""hard"" press.,This hard press finally solved the moving and resizing windows issues - again none of this info was included with product.,2. very confusing from reviews n QnAs whether or not this mac had 7 or 8 core GPU - according to internal report its 8 core,3. what have i learned -,- very lightweight machine,- lots of internal tweaking can be done to personalize machine,- very fast on the task used - browsing and some excel files now needing to run under mac for which i purchased new software,- beautiful screen,- great battery life,- particularly liked my iphone messages show up on the mac and i can send and receive on same - apple makes computer look sim to phone,4. recommendation - for 1000$ to 1200$ a student or any one like me, whos not going to program or have a gazillion windows open or need a large screen, can get this machine - a comparable windows machine would cost same but a windows machine can also be purchased for a lot less and still be capable of student tasks.,However, the battery life and weight and integration w iphone tip the scales to this machine if you want to purchase a comparable MS product

  I have had my new MacAir not quite two weeks and it is even better than I expected.  This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Mac....which I loved.  Faster, better, more battery.  What's not to like.  And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain.  I do not use my Mac for gaming, heavy downloads, large graphics so can't comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro.  Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my ""old"" Mac on the M1 so everything works better.  I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weight....but that's likely because I didn't look at those specs before purchase.  One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70% charged so just open and start.  If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it.  And Amazon made it easy....arrived in two days.

  No problems with the mac air. Easy to transition from my old 2104 MacBook Pro. I also bought an external HD which was cheaper than upgrading from old 256 to 512. My warning is about Office 2019. There was stuff on the web that 2016 would not work, needed 64bit, but while there seemed to be workarounds, I just upgraded and bought 2019. There is a scam site posing as Microsoft Office/setup that looks legit once on it, but you get an error message and phone number to resolve. After half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars. The url isn't Microsoft but rest looks like it. While I didn't fall for it, it is preying on the few who might. So thought I would mention it. The mac is good and worth upgrading especially if, as with mine, hardware faults are developing in old one.

Tom Y.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had given this a few months since release for some of the software compatibility issues to be straightened out, and was encouraged by reviews. However, there are significant unresolved issues from the hardware side of things: 1. there is a known problem with disk usage related to RAM disk swap (from what I understand) and media-heavy usage (why I bought this laptop) deteriorates the SSD quickly. 2. the FaceTime camera is absolutely terrible. There is no other way to put this. It may be the worst camera I have seen on any device since my iPhone 3G. The picture is incredibly blurry, and not suitable for the COVID/virtual environment. There have been issued raised about this in Apple support forums with no resolution.,Unfortunately my return window has passed, but I would not recommend this machine to anyone. Really thought Apple had turned a corner with their new processor, but ended up being stuck with a bunch of other systems that weren't upgraded. 2/10

  First off: this computer is extremely lightweight, well built, and beautiful. Yes this is the new MacBook Air M1. And it arrived with 4 days after shipping (bad weather slowed it down so it arrived late).,Battery: I’ve been on my computer for 12 hours today and battery is at 64%. I’ve had it for 3 days. And have only charged it once.  And that was when it arrived while I set up.  The computer is very quiet it and does not get hot. I’ve had several tabs open and applications at once and it didn’t even slow down or run hot.,Camera: FaceTime calls are beautiful on here. Facebook messenger, you look a little yellow, but other people look perfect(probably lighting issue),Sound: is amazing, the best I have had on any computer. Crystal clear sound. This computer gets really loud,Speed: this computer is extremely fast.  Internet sites load with a second. As soon as you sign in it’s an instant log on to your screen with no waiting for application to load.,This by far the best computer I’ve had. If you are looking at your first MacBook laptop this is great(this is my first also). If you are looking to upgrade a really old MacBook model you will love this. Worth the money!

  This Macbook is definitely great for users who want lots of power and versatility, but don't want to break the bank. It is very lightweight and sleek.The color (gold) is also very pretty, but keep in mind that it is more of a pinkish gold than a yellow gold. However, the camera quality is not great for such an otherwise powerful laptop. Especially in this era of zooming and FaceTiming, a good camera is essential in a laptop. It's not terrible, but its not great either. Another thing - the front lid of the MacBook got a couple of scratches very easily. I was able to get them off, but I would suggest getting a good quality case to ensure that this doesn't happen. All in all I would rate this Macbook a 4.5/5! Definitely lived up to the hype!

  Works as expected. Shipping was quick. The rose-gold color is a very pretty shade. I have had Macs in the past, but not an Air. I love how thin it is. Not many ports and only two USB-C ones, so note that. I mainly needed just my iPhone 12 Pro to be able to plug into it, so it works for me.,My last Mac was a 2011 MacBook Pro. It still works great, but I needed some updated stuff. Just the fact that it lasted me 10+ years shows its value. It is worth it. Once you go Mac, you never go back. ;)

  I was scared jumping from my 2020 MBP-16 to a MB-Air.  But I wanted lighter and figured I could carry both if I need the power of my Pro.  Ummmm, I don't need my Pro.  This thing blows my almost brand new Intel based MBP!  Now, there have been some anomalies with different apps and things.  No show stoppers.  But you can clearly tell which apps were updated for the M1 and which weren't  They work fine, but take a several seconds to open.,One process I use it for is livestreaming our church services using OBS, and iPhone and a USB Audio device for the feed from the mixer.  All of this is streamed only to FB Live and recorded on machine.  On the MBP, this all worked fine, but the battery couldn't keep up, even plugged in.  Had the same issue on my 2018 MBP 13"".  But the M1 does all of this without any issues from a power perspective.  Plus, it's much more stable for this use than the MBP.  I would get a lot of sticking video on the MBP and have, so far, received none on the M1.,Very happy with the price too.  But, get as much memory and disk space as you can afford.  Can't have too much.

  I've had and used iPhones from the beginning and had iPads since the iPad 2 but this is my very first Mac and I thought it might be a lot to learn this OS but things were familiar cuz I've used and owned iPads and iPhones.  I'm still having to learn a few things and had to Google questions on how to do somethings but it's been a good experience.  I really didn't expect that.  I love the OS BIG SUR and now can't wait to the next OS.  I only got 256gb cuz I didn't know if I would like this plus I knew i had to learn the OS.  Now, I'm waiting for the M2 Mac Book Pro, i plan to invest a lot more money into that one now I know that I like the Apple OS.  Looking at getting 2tb 32gigs of ram!  I like that it runs the apps from iOS or iPadOS!  I wish the screen was better though.  I'm talking at least mini-led but would prefer OLED for what I use it for.  Battery life is amazing! Camera quality sucks.  Come on Apple, give us the 2021 M1 iPad Pro camera and stop being so cheap!,I'm happy with my purchase.  I will probably give this to my mom when the M2 MacBook Pro comes out!

  I had tremendously high hopes for this CPU especially after reading the reviews of its 'speed', factually this is the slowest CPU I have ever used. The loading of web pages is truly pathetic, especially for 2021 and especially for the processor. The usual crap about speeding up the loading time is the usual garbage, 'clear the cache, is there enough room on the HD...' bla bla bla...' The damn thing is absurdly slow. The build quality is exceptional, the case is +, etc., and using the box offline is fine in terms of speed, but loading web pages, getting hung up on web pages, etc. is just plain BS. If anyone has any real advise on how to speed this thing up I would appreciate it but I am seriously thinking about returning it... My 2012 Lenova is actually faster. My INT is a fiber optics with plenty of juice...

  I previously used the Macbook Pro because I needed to create sales and marketing materials using Adobe apps,  PowerPoint and Final Cut Pro (video).  I now have a Macbook Air with the M1 processor (SOC = system on a chip) that  DESTROYS my 2020 Macbook Pro with an Intel chip.,The Air machines don't even have a cooling fan which means it runs silently! It has handled everything I currently do without breaking a sweat and it even can run Parallels with Windows 10 on ARM better than a Surface Pro X.,These M1-powered machines are incredible. Unless you have a specific need for an Intel-based machine or you have a very proprietary application that is not yet compatible with the M1, I strongly recommend you consider a unit such as this Macbook Air, the similar Macbook Pro or even the Mac Mini (all available with the M1).

M. Dillon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a very solid device.  Wonderful job, Apple!  The only thing unexpected about it was the weight... the dimensions are smaller than the old macbook air my wife had, but heavier.  Screen size is the same (thinner bezzle around the edges).,I am going to give it 5 stars because... come on!  Apple's own M1 processor!  But I will throw in a provisio.  Google's chrome (native for the M1 processor) seg-faults quite a bit on this unit, though it has slowly been getting better as Google has updated the application to work better with the M1.  I do expect google will fix these issues over the next few weeks, it is a very new system after all and a new architecture target for chrome.  But beware of that.,I do wish Apple had kept the mag-safe power supply, but I'm not gonna dock Apple any stars for using USB-C for charging.,-Matt

Michael Mccarthy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So for the most part I use this for when I am traveling or out and about for my business. I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.

Darryl Ballard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Caveats: This is a Mac, so like any other, software choice can be limited. It's also the new ARM/M1 chip, so certain programs haven't caught up (as of early 2021), especially virtualization (VMWare, VirtualBox) and languages (Haskell).  This is a 13-inch screen, so screen real estate is limited, I couldn't recommend this as a ""daily driver"", except maybe for school/university.  Probably a great option if you're frequently on Google Meet or Zoom.,Overall: amazing battery life; unmatched 3D power for the size & price; gorgeous screen with no color/brightness lost when tilted nor LCD configuration needed to optimize color, white/black levels; Mac OS Big Sur is constantly fast and responsive with smooth animation regardless of what is open/running.,I've bought a lot of laptops, but this one surprisingly nice.  If you have to have Windows, or have to stay $1000, get a Microsoft Surface (great too), but if you need a Mac or can afford the splurge, absolutely get this Air M1.

  But, I love this laptop.  After asking multiple people who have purchased the same (or better) models and I couldn't be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of MacBook Air.  Does everything I would expect an Apple Computer to do (for what I need it for, basic photo editing, viewing, and typing). So far it's been an amazing purchase.  Just for the sake of keeping Apple on their toes I rated the Battery Life 4 stars and the camera quality 4 stars, as well as the 4 star overall review.  Keep it up Apple, as long as you continue to make the products user-friendly I'll remain a happy customer for years to come.

  I just love this Macbook air.  It replaced my 2014 model that was an 11 inch model.  IT is like light years ahead of that computer, although the old one is wonderful too.  The keyboard is smooth as silk and so easy to type on. I could go on and on about the screen.  Crisp, clear, bright, and wonderful.  I really enjoy the backgrounds on Big Sur as well now.  The speed with the M1 chip is phenomenal on all the programs that I use.,Youtube is a great place to get more technical reviews than I have left.  But from an ordinary, person this laptop is fabulous.

  I own a business(photography business) and first and foremost being able to travel lightly but efficiently was key.  The MBA is an amazing little tool for the form factor that it is.  It is a quick little machine with ZERO noise.  Can you believe that?  Stick with me and I will try and keep it simple enough.  Processing power is ""decent"".  It does not wow me, especially with graphics intensive workflows like Lightroom, Photoshop and Panoramic building.  Everything else it works just as intended and no real hiccups.  Being that my business is in the creative realm I import a TON of data via USB and the macbook air's inputs.  I must say I am completely up in arms with the inputs in this decive and would imagine the inputs in the Macbook Pro would operate in the same fashion.,For instance it took almost 1 hour to input a 64gb SD card.  For real?  This is appalling and do believe there is something inhibiting the performance of this transfer as the cards write at 90mb/s.,-Pros-,Small Form Factor,Silent,Decent Processing Power,Light,-Cons-,Onboard Graphics very low spec,2 IO Ports,Extremely slow IO ports for being ""USB 4.0"",If the USB inputs were better Id give this a 5 star.  When importing data it is just abysmal.

  I looked at a lot of different laptops and went to my local Best Buy for in person testing before deciding on this one.  I work from home and have been using a older model HP that was passed down to me that had a hour and a half battery life, a plastic shell, and froze endlessly.,This laptop is real clean looking, feels solid, has insane battery life, and the screen is absolutely insane.  Watching videos on it is unreal and have had no issues running multiple programs/desktops/and some gaming on it.  I purchased the base model and run it with an external hard drive to keep the space clear on it.,I love how all the apple products interact seamlessly with each other and the sidecar feature that links it to the iPad to work as a second screen on the go.,In the future would be nice to see the bezels slimmed down, the keyboard have a little more weight to it, MacBook Air speakers amped up a bit, and a higher quality camera and all those things are near perfect.  Ill be holding on to this for the next 5 years plus

Sophia Obas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have always wanted a MacBook, ever since I was a little kid. But, there was always something that stopped me from getting one. They always mentioned that the Air wasn't very good, from 2011 all the way up to 2019, reviews always mentioned the multiple flaws MacBook Air had; from the thermal throttling, to the super small SSD (128 at base price), over $1000, then the Butterfly Keyboard etc. The list went on and on, and I really thought that it wasn't worth the money. Until, WWDC 2020, Apple announced they would start making their own chips straight from home, I was so excited for this new generation, it reminded me of the time when they went from PowerPC to Intel. The excitement was there, and I loved the new unibody that started in 2016, with the removal of unnecessary ports for the average Joe. Everything was the same, but the new M1 chip. That is when I realized that this M1 MacBook Air was the one for me. I didn't hesitate and started saving until I had enough to buy it. And, I absolutely made the best decision in purchasing it. It is amazing, it's super slim. portable, super fast processing speed and power. The screen is beautiful, the bezels are unnoticeable. The keyboard is outstanding, To be completely honest, this laptop makes you want to be more productive, just because of its speed and its ease of use. If you're thinking about purchasing a Mac, this by far is one of the better choices (and the cheapest nonetheless) The charger is also outstanding! 30w is all you need for this little thing.

  The touch screen reen is very lacking I've never been able to get my finger print to accept or any other action by touching the screen. The scroll pad is non responsive to a right click to download a picture. I've gotten all and latest updates but no improved action. The screen resolution is great and speakers give good stereo imaging. And its reasonably fast. I may try a mouse to see if this is better than the scroll pad. But Apple needs to fix these problems,  I should have buy extras to get it work properly. I'm having to edit this review this new MacBook Air works by drag and drop not right click to download. Update: i contacted Apple support and they were very helpful helping with log in issues on the app store . They are the best I so glad to have Apple on my team they are great after an hour we finally fixed the problem they never gave up.

  I've had a variety of Apple equipment in my life-- but also Microsoft Surface, Surface Laptops, Chromebooks, and more. I'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. I like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.,I bought this one open box, that shouldn't matter at all, and it doesn't. It arrived from Amazon Warehouse Deals as ""like new"" condition with ""like new box"" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- I'm happy to have the remainder.,The latest Macbook I had was the 12"" Macbook from several years back. It was quite nice but was too small for me. This one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and CERTAINLY has improved on the performance front.,The unit is thin, svelte, and HEAVY. I mean, it could be a solid block of metal and I would expect the same heft. It's solid. This is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.,The keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, I am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather ""controversial"" and I very much do appreciate the touch ID in the power button.,Having two USB-C ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.,When looking at the performance of the M1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12"" Macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. Even compared to the Macbook Pro M1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.,I love Windows for some things. I have Windows running on this unit as well with Parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download ARM Windows 10 media for this unit-- I was not able to find a way to migrate my previous VM from Intel based.  It runs very well here and with no issues. Very fast.,One thing that didn't work great for me-- maybe it's me-- maybe it's Mac OS-- was plugging it in to a USB-C dock. I have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, USB based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as I cycle through Chromebooks and Windows devices, I'm able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. In this case I haven't had success getting this Mac to work with my USB-C based dock and accessories-- to be determined.,The screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  I also have a Surface Laptop that I love, but for the Mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent.

  It's not a bad little laptop.  I am NOT a techie person so don't expect fancy tech terms or a deep understanding of all things Apple in this review.  I'm your standard user looking for a dedicated, decent machine for work without breaking the bank.,The M1 chip is supposed to be crazy fast compared to the previous version and yes, so far it is pretty good.  I use a graphic webpage called Canva and I am constantly getting a message telling me that it's using excessive power & slowing my Macs performance down.  This even happens with Candy Crush..  I haven't noticed any decrease in performance though.,I also have the 2018 MacBook Air and it's FaceTime video is FAR superior to this 2020 version which is very low quality and grainy.. I think my 2014 HP has a better quality video.  So if you're looking for clear, crisp video for Zoom meetings you won't find it here.  I mean really, I expected a LOT more from an Apple product.,The power cord is not magnetic like the 2018, which to me was a much better design.  ""Someone"" is forever tripping over my cord and yanking it out which was fine with the 2018 version but this one will end up damaged if I can't find a way to get it out of the way.  Small spaces are challenging :),I had to buy a compatible hub so that I could continue using my USB wireless mouse & flash drives since this MacBook Air only has 2 ""thunderbolt usb"" ports & one of them is for the power cord.  It's not backwards compatible with all of my standard USB devices and no place at all for an SD card.,I do LOVE the convenience fingerprint login/keychain feature.  I love that it's very quiet (so far) and other than FaceTime the colors and screen resolution are excellent and vibrant as advertised.

  I've worked on and serviced Macs for many years, but I've never considered purchasing one for the price. Macs have never been a good value. I wanted a $1000 laptop, and my choices quickly narrowed to this. It has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy, especially at this price. The battery life on MacBooks is always good, so I knew that wouldn't be an issue.,After purchase, I've come to the same conclusions. The screen is wonderful. Bright and high res, excellent color accuracy. The M1 processor speed has blown me away with its performance. I don't need much RAM or Storage, so I'm still happy with that. I do wish for more RAM, but I don't necessarily need it for my work I do. What has blown my mind more than anything else is the battery life. I've never had a laptop like this. I don't have to carry a charger with me anymore: the MacBook easily handles a full day of charge. I also like the fact that it doesn't have a fan. I don't have to worry about thermals when getting comfy in my bed and doing some light work.,Overall, best laptop I've ever purchased. I've had no issues over more than a month of ownership, and I'm super picky about tech as well as slightly anti-Apple, so I've basically converted because of this machine.

  I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.,When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace's gaming desktop!,I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.,8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any ""throttling"" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.,256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won't run into any storage issues.,Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.,My only complaint is that the design is a bit ""outdated"" despite how premium and beautiful it is.,Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her ""prehistoric"" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.,Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level. Go get this beast of a machine now for $850.

  This laptop is really fast and the battery lasts really long.,The battery lasts me about a week with just one charge and I find that crazy.,There is not fan noise and this doesn't get hot.,The quality is really good.. I mean the way the laptop opens with one hand and the smooth closing of the lid is really smooth.,The screen isn't the best but its still really good.,This laptop has the M1 chip, fastest chip on the market.,This laptop's bench marks are off the roof.,It's great for casual use like, watching movies, using word docs and excel sheet, coding and video editing.,I wouldn't recommend gaming even though basic games will do just fine.

  This machine is NOT powerful enough to run design software and Google Chrome at the same time. Just FYI. It's laggy, sputters, and a total piece of junk for the most part if you're trying to run any of Adobe Suite or Sketchup or heavy'ish program. It has trouble runing Keynote, Spotify, and chrome at the same time. This is great for surfing the web and using a few of the internal apple products but a complete waste of money if you're looking for a work computer and do any kind of creative design or work. Apple's products are garbage and we're all stuck in their hellish ecosphere.

  I just got my new laptop less than a month ago... I picked it up by the screen, and im a pretty tiny person.. and it like broke on the inside or something, the screen just shot out.. i wanted to just replace it for a new one But i would have had to go to the bank to put money in, because i guess you need the amount it would cost to do that. I was told that we would just do the refund, and i could rebuy it.. my refund seems to be taking a while, and it looks like the prices just went up on top of it. So im not very happy right now. i want to get the replacement. Def going to get the apple care plan (which also looks like it went up in price)  from like 2 days ago

  I really like my purchase of the MacBook Pro. It is super fast. The colors on the screen are bright & clear. I love the the 13 inch screen. It’s the perfect size for me. Since it didn’t have any usb plug ins I bought me a hub for it that has usb, hdmi, slot for memory card & it has 3.0. Love this Mac. Would recommend it.

  I love Apple when it comes to computing. Their software is efficient, error free and easy to use. Their computers perform efficiently and they virtually never freeze up. The only issue with my last Mac was that the mag safe power cord would consistently fray and the hard drive cable had to be replaced 3x over 8 years (should change every 2-3 yrs). This mac hasnt given me any problems in the first couple days. I did notice a lot of software and drivers dont seem to support the new Apple chips yet, but I have no doubt it will eventually happen.
"
Jamilla Webb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I never make reviews but I have to make one for this. I’ve had this computer since March and it’s June now, and I have to say, I really, really, really love my computer. It’s super fast and the speakers are loud and it’s everything you could want. My only issue is that there is no USB port. When I’m editing I find it very difficult to use the mousepad because I can’t be precise with my work the way I do with a mouse. I just bought an adapter today, and I hope it makes my editing much more easier. But all I can say is that I spent a lot of money upgrading my 2011 MacBook Pro and I decided to just buy this computer with my stimulus check and it was the best decision I’ve ever made.

  I have been on with Apple support or MacBook support many times now extremely frustrating that this thing can’t get up and going,It took a month to get to me leaving me only nine days for a return window which is crap if you ask me. It took me longer than that to figure out why it’s not working with two monitors. There needs to be an exception to the one month from order date when it takes a month to get here!!!

  It has been a long time since I bought a computer, but we were in desperate need of something for the entire family to be able to use. I opted for the pro with a larger hard drive just for a bit of extra storage. This laptop is fast and offers a lot of options for software.
"
Lee Kibbler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the bargain deal of the Apple lineup at the moment. The M1 chip gives it crazy power management which equates to ridiculously long battery life, incredibly low temperature operation which needs no fan so also absolute silence. All this while running circles around the competitors offerings which don’t stand a chance of keeping up with this incredible product. With their M1 chip Apple has not just revolutionized the capabilities of a laptop but turned the whole computer industry upside down! And yes it is extremely well made out of a solid chunk of aluminum, is very light and has a world class screen and a redesigned keyboard that feels wonderful. Incase you couldn’t tell I like and recommend this laptop!
"
Donnie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First time Macbook owner. Really happy with the MacBook Air. Don't let the lack of a fan be off-putting. The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie. Even then, it's by no means hot to the touch. This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say, ever. The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts. The soldered in m.2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint. So far I'm not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue. Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip. So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly. The battery life is next level. Over all it's more powerful, cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever. If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade. This would not be a bad choice.
"
August West,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Can't add much that hasn't already been said. I upgraded from a 2017 MacBook Air and find this to be superior in just about every way. The battery life is at least twice what the 2017 was, the screen is much better, the keyboard is better, the overall size of the computer is smaller and I love the larger haptic feedback touchpad. I don't use the camera but it isn't the greatest from what I understand and I do kind of miss the magsafe connector.

  This product does not allow you to hook up two external monitors with the M1 chip. Otherwise I’m sure the function is fine. Just disappointing the newest computer does less than the older models.

  Not long ago I decided to get far from Apple products because some work necessities I couldn't cover with an iPhone and a Mac. The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.,I had a Samsung s10+ and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux. Both devices are impeccable. Really made my work easier in so many aspects. But as time passed my life wasn't getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my Mac.,Apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life. Quality of this products and its software is incredible. Although other products have better capabilities ( for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen) they lack the simplicity and stability.,Being all this said, The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop. The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast, stable and with a great battery life (much better than the Huawei Matebook pro). Also its absolute silent and fresh. Its doesn't get hot at all.,To make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning.  Apple products are expensive but I've learned that in the long run they are worth it. Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task.,I wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had. If you have an iPhone and other Apple products don't doubt. Buy a Macbook Air M1. I still have a beefy windows machine for gaming, rendering, and other things. But most of the time I rather work in my new MacBook.
"
SIerra Gray,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My first day. I’ve used MacBooks since 2006 when the first Intel processors were used. The M1 chip is amazing. I now understand why 8 Gb of RAM is perfect for this model. Crystal clear text rendering. Silky-smooth touch pad. Nice tactile response on keyboard— big improvement over the troublesome keyboards of the last 7 years. Speakers are lovely. Very pleased. Battery fully charged. Was able to easily migrate from my old 2016 MacBook Retina 12. Easy to connect with iCloud and Mac account. A couple of my non-Apple apps required Rosetta to run with M1 processor—smooth download of Rosetta. Anyone needing a high end camera might go for the MacBook Pro but this is fine for my needs.

  I've always been a windows PC user. The brand I normally get doesn't sell anymore. I decided to switch to Mac. Oh my...I wish I'd done it sooner. I love this computer so much. It's fast. The screen quality is amazing. I had to get used to it not being a touch screen but it's worth losing that feature. I don't miss windows at all. Everything is so much easier to use. If you're hesitating, don't. You won't regret it.

  The M1 chip is amazing and a miracle, this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing. This MacBook Air is very powerful. the downside to it, is that it doesn't have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement.

  I only have one thing I didn’t like.... it actually has nothing to do with the computer!I LOVE the computer but when the delivery guy destroyed our yard because they drove through it and got stuck is really aggravating! This is NOt the first time they have done this! And we have asked multiple times NOT to do it! We have multiple areas where Amazon workers have drove in our yard and messed it up!  They tell us that they will fix it but never do! My mother in law  and father in law are pissed so be prepared for a call from them :-)

Nicholas smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  every older generation is practically the same, if you are interested in getting any mac the macbook air late 2015 model will fit all your needs and if cleaned properly will work like new. all airs can last extremely long. good quality laptop M1 chip is very powerful but 90% of users wont be able to use this mac to its full capacity honestly. But if you looking for an upgrade this is it, beautiful look, sleek design, light, powerful. will last from freshman year of college to well in post grad career. i say every mac with proper care can last a good 5-6 years then should be handed down to a friend. I gave my last mac book air (2015) away when I got this and my friends says the best laptop they ever had. again only mac worth buying new if you already own one and want to upgrade, 90% of those who will use it wont need the power and capacity it comes with.
"
Nicolas Coyon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why Apple is trying to punish me for but it's fine. Also be really careful because the screen is special, it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks. Sound is boxy I'd recommend SpeakerAmp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound. But nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment
"
Fattiesmama,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This was everything I expected it to be. The screen is small but bright. I use it for virtual teaching, it handles zoom, google meets and all my other needs. I can use my iPad as a second screen when needed. I like how my Apple ID paired this with all my devices. I charge it daily and it gets me though my daily needs. The only thing I didn’t get was a notification to purchase AppleCare. It’s easy enough to do online.
"
rod,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s a great computer;  is stupidly fast,  the battery last for 15 to 20 hrs on constant use.  If you don’t use it that much last for days without recharge.  It behaves like a smartphone but just bigger to fit a full keyboard and a big screen, with the same or better performance.  This is the new era of laptops and desktops, you’ll see soon other brands doing it too.  Because it uses “NO FAN AT ALL”, is very thin and lightweight.  I don’t need to use an egg carton on my lap to avoid overheating like the fan ones. The M1 ship is definitely a great upgrade.  Excellent idea!!!
"
David Martinez Garcia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What I liked: Apple's construction quality is second to none. Unboxing this is a delight, it's just a beautiful machine. You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).,What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.,All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it. No heavy usage so far, except for some minor audio production work. Guess I'll do it eventually. Hope app compatibility gets better with time too, that's the reason for the missing star up there, otherwise, it would've been 5-stars all the way.

Maria D. Arriaga,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Back in 2012 I got a MacBook Air with 8GB i7 and a turbo... back in the day it was the most equipped... I believe it was slightly faster in the kickstart by 2 or 3 seconds... yet back then I also paid about 1700 usd, my video card broke at some point back then and I was a bit upset that my only option was to replace the whole mother board, so I kept it broken and fixed it a couple of years later about about 320 usd and it worked decently for an extra couple of years for basic work...I then got an ASUS with 16GB plus 2GB just for video as I wanted it for video editing, but it has 2TB + 256 SSD so the computer is massive and heavy and it has a cheap unresponsive trackpad making it so inconvenient to travel or work at a coffeeshop. SO eventually I am back with Mac for editing my website, answering emails, and all the other trials and tribulations of work... It is so refreshing and made me realize how much I missed this system as well.
"
Jim Flanagan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This new Mac is more powerful than all previous versions, runs silent (no fans), dissipates heat under the heaviest of loads with no throttling, and does so while lasting 48 hours on a chafe and being almost as light as your phone.,People taking about M1 being an issue either don’t know enough to figure it out or are straight lying. Everything works fine.,If you’re looking to upgrade, you can’t go wrong with this.
"
austin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The device is silent because it has no fans, the screen isn't Oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts. The battery life is incredibly good I can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device. It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers, especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise, and if you don't use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop. It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use. If you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice.

Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Likes: happy wife,But seriously, I’m not a MacOS user, personally, but my wife is and she loves it. Her old 2012 Macbook Pro could finally be put to rest.,These machines last a LONG time. The battery life easily lasts her two full days of use (probably around 15 hours).,As a nurse, she’s constantly looking up new techniques or reviewing current literature, so her next laptop needed to be power-efficient, but powerful.,The M1 does just that.,The screen quality is second to none as you can expect from Apple products.,This particular mac (2020 MacBook Air M113”) does NOT have the touchbar that the,Pros do — and we’re glad! It felt out of place when we were trying out the new lineup of Macs.,This Air also has the “new” keyboard— which is just Apple going back to their old style of chiclet keyboard—a fan favorite.,Also, this Air never gets hot. This is something new to me as I’m used to devices running too hot after long usage, but the Air’s M1 is so efficient the laptop doesn’t need a fan!
"
Mark Baker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.,The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.,The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.,Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has NO USB PORTS!!!"", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.,All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.

  Only complaint is my computer only has 2 USB ports, of which they are specifically designed to only fit the computer charger.

  After getting what I paid for in cheaper PCs only lasting a couple years at a time, I decided to switch to a Mac. This version with the new chip works well and was 200 dollars off when we got it. I also love the touch bar and hope they do not get rid of it permanently in future models.  The 2020 MacBooks are great deal for the top notch performance the M1 chips have.

Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had a 2008 MacBook Pro that I used until 2014. I then switched back to a PC until purchasing this M1 MacBook a month ago. I don’t know why I haven’t been using a Mac sooner. Having messages and FaceTime and synced with my phone, along with MS office functionality makes this computer a dream to use.,Only issue I had was using a usb c to display port plug to plug into my monitor. Worked great until the latest update of Big Sur. Have an open case with Apple and they seem perplexed, but a quick review of reddit shows this seems to be an issue with the M1 chip. I ended up purchasing a usb-c to hdmi adapter and have had no further issues, except being out $15 for the first cable.

KMan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was a bit skeptical of everyone saying how great the M1 Air is. I’ve been using a Windows gaming PC with an i7 9700k processor and 16 gigs of ram for audio production with a lot of amp simulators (processor intensive) and sample libraries (ram intensive). I needed to be able to create music on the go and I wasn’t sure the M1 was up for the task since desktop processors perform better than mobile processors. Boy was I wrong. I reached more than double the amount of amp sims as my desktop PC could do and was still only at 50% processor usage! These ARM processors are so much more efficient than Intel so if you’re looking to do audio production on the go, the M1 is the way to go. I do wish I got the 1tb or 2tb though to avoid needed to keep an external hard drive plugged in though so get as much storage as you can possibly afford

  I love my Mac book Air.  Very easy to use.  I love that everything goes to iPhone, iPad and Mac book and I don't have to do anything.  I have not began to use all of the 100's of features.  Extremely pleased.

  Pros: Battery life : 5 stars, this machine last all day and I don't even know how,Screen: 2560x1600 in a 13 inch screen is remarkable,Look: It's apple so I got nothing to complain,Sound: You can hear this from your bathroom with curtain and door closed,HEAT: DOES NOT HAVE ANY FAN SOUND AND HEAT PROBLEM AT ALL. THIS THING IS QUIET !!!,Keyboard: No more butterfly keyboard!,Cons: Apple got the same deal for student but they attach FREE airpod so sadly I have to return this to amazon so I can that deal,Smuge spot due to fingerprint or sweat on keyboard is unavoidable and very annoying to look at but I guess it is what it is.,All in all, I highly recommend this to any college student especially comp sci major to buy this. I was always a window users except for my Iphone and I also have a fair share of laptop from gaming to everyday but this M1 laptop right here beat everything else at this price point.

  i love this laptop. from the small apple logo that i see as a mirror on the screen part of the laptop to the keyboard. everything is awesome.,things i loved:,-battery is great. got it delievered around 3pm and when i got home i immediately turned it on and it was around 75% battery. ive been on it all day/night and its at 45%,-screen. the brightness it great. i can anything i want with the easy controls and i can the colors are so vibrant and pleasing to look at,-keyboard. i am one who is stuck in the keyboard hobby and i know what is and isnt a good keyboard. the one on this macbook is quite nice. it has a nice sound and feel to it. i love the amount of key travel on it considering it is a small laptop that doesnt even weigh 3 pounds,-speakers. i love that even with the first level of volume on i can still hear it quite clearly. the sound of the speakers is insane and that fact that apple even added the spekers to the sides od the keyboard too is even better. almost like surround sound,-design. i love the sleek and slender design of the laptop its so minimalistic and i love that so much. there isnt any big details on the outside or inside which i like. (although this may not be a good part of the review as this is kinda based off of the buyers opinion(s)),tldr: the battery is very very good. long lasting. the screen is also very pleasing to look at. the colors truly do show themselves on this laptop and the brightness control is also very nice to have. the keyboard is very nice quality and sounds nice and feels nice to type on. teh speakers almost act as surround sound because they are on both sides of me and have a very nice output of the sound. lastly, the design is sleek and minimalistic and i love that.,oh and did i mention that the touch pad is also very nice. its like the home button on the iphone 7 and 8. it doesnt actually click it just feels like it which i happen to like too

  I tried several other higher cost laptops. Namely Windows based.  I was dissatisfied, display resolution was lacking, battery life, etc...  Looked at the new MacBook Air and purchased it.  I am satisfied with it, no regrets!!!  Seems like it was created by people in the future! ;)

  Not sure what Apple is going with their products, but what the hell is wrong with their screen and camera quality?,However, my first MACBOOK, battery charging (AWESOME and FAST), battery life (IMPECABLE), efficiency (GREAT)...STARTUP (SUPER SLOW)

  I absolutely love this laptop. I'm a software engineer and as you can imagine I spend a lot of time of the computer. This computer is lightning fast, a dream to type on, and it has a beautiful screen. The only downside is that camera quality, which is absolutely atrocious. I have a desktop PC that I do my web conferencing over anyways, so it's not big deal for me. If you really care about the webcam, I would suggest purchasing a third-party webcam. Other than that, I highly recommend this product and I could not be more pleased with it.

  This is a replacement for my 11 year old MacBook Pro that still works but I’m glad to have this new MacBook Pro Air. It’s battery life is far better that my old one and I am enjoying its much lighter weight. Amazon’s price was the best I could find and with my Prime Chase card I am buying it interest free.

RMT Family,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first Mac. It was not hard to get used to it as the laptop itself works great and has all the features needed. The battery life is extreme. Way longer than I expected. it also charges real quick. Nice that it uses a USB C plug to charge, it can be plugged in at any USB C plug. The only thing is that it only has two USB C ports. No SD or micro SD reader. I used an external Seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac, just had to download free software from Seagate. The hard drive has 2 USB A ports that I can use to connect some of my devices that don't have a USB C plug. But this MacBook Air is super cool. The camera and microphone have great picture and sound quality. I have not even had a need to use my external Blue mic yet.

  Se la compré a mi hermana y hasta me antojé yo de una. Yo soy estudiante de ingienería en software y pues todos los dias estamos en contacto con computadores y la mayoría de ellos Windows y distribuciones de Linux. Muchos de nosotros, como estudiantes de esta rama,  tenemos una mala imagen de lo que es Apple como marca: que básicamente te venden la manzana mordida, pero al fin y al cabo todo esto son prejuicios. Al final me di cuenta que estaba equivocado. Una cosa segura es que te puedas comprar una PC con mejores especificaciones a este precio, pero la belleza y lo fino que son estas MacBook y el sistema operativo, hace que, aunque suene raro, las especificaciones queden un poco de lado. En fin. Súmamente feliz de este producto, es algo diferente a lo habitual, y había experimentarlo para poder juzgar. 10/10

  This is the first Apple computer I've ever had and I adore my Mac. I originally bought it for editing my videos for my YouTube channel (Rae of Sun Asmr) which is still its main function. Now however, I almost prefer watching things like Netflix, etc. on here vs on my actual television. Picture quality on this thing is superior. Highly recommend.

  Already had a brand new laptop Windows, dealing with pop-ups malware crap not to mention a big bulky laptop etc. wanted to get back in the game for quite some time, always wanted a Mac air, Best decision ever! Incorporates well with all my Apple products and just makes things a breeze with all it can do! The battery life is phenomenal along with the screen! Don’t get me wrong I was hung up on the high price tag! But I’m so glad I pulled the trigger now!

  This is a M1 Macbook Air what more can we say?  We went with Used - Good Condition Space Gray in order to save money and so far everything looks and works well.  There were 2 battery cycles, minor signs of use on the bottom, and the charger was obviously used but otherwise its in good shape.  There were about 8 months of factory warranty left and I couldn't add applecare+ since it was bought used so I went with a 3rd party warranbty service instead.

  This piece of junk is unable to connect wirelessly to  my printer.  My 10 year old mac has no problems printing on my Epson printer.  I have tried everything suggested and it still claims my printer is OFFLINE.,It won't even find the printer when it is connected to it with a USB cable.  I think Apple has really screwed this product up.

  I had several problems so took the MacBook Air into Best Buy for help.  I was told I had received ""a lemon"" and should return it to Amazon.  I had it 3 weeks so was able to return it for a refund which I am waiting for right now.  I have loved my 2012 MacBook Air and am hoping the next one I order will be okay.
"
Road Warrior,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The outward look of this Mac Air is not that different from my MacBook Pro that I bought in 2015 - with one exception: the new model has the M1 Chip and it never seams to heat up. The old model sizzled enough to brand your legs if you use it in laptop position.,No complaints on Apple products, though. I can only hope this M1 model lasts as long. It’s a good bet because heat is one of the chief reasons for internal parts going bad. This is one cool computer!

  So far I’m super happy. I’ve always bought cheap laptops but felt it was time to invest in something better. I’ve never owned a Mac and fell in love immediately. It’s so nice to have my phone and watch work in sync with my computer. I didn’t realize what I was missing. It’s fancy and pretty and while I worry I might break it because it’s so thin and was pretty pricey I just can’t regret the purchase. I love it.

  This MBA is fan-TAS-tic to use. It can run unplugged all day. The speaker is sufficiently loud, and the hi-rez screen is eye-popping.,But using a Mac laptop's USB-C port for power, after more than a decade of Mag-Safe bliss, is darn-near CRIMINAL. Thankfully, we still have capitalism, and there are a number of 3rd-party workaround devices that mimic Mag-Safe to a greater-or-lesser degree. Sigh.

  The M1 MacBook Air is my favorite portable Mac I’ve ever owned. It runs really great with the M1 chip. Battery Life is seriously all day. I normally go for the most RAM I can get, but went with the 8GB as Amazon had a sale and I don’t regret it. Can simultaneously run lots of Browser tabs, Slack, and all my other work apps with no sluggishness.

  Zoom calls perfect and beautiful. Video quality is excellent.  Performance is amazing.  Running Parallels and Windows 11 preview. Screen looks beautiful.  Movies look amazing.  Audio is loud and sounds spacial.  Battery lasts easily all day and sometimes two days.,Blows away my 2015 MacBook Air.  Blows away my 2016 MacBook Pro.  Don't miss the Touch Bar.,Ports are enough.  But wish there was one on each side.,As perfect a laptop I have owned.,And this M1 MacBook air run Windows 11! I use Parallels and Windows runs super fast and looks amazing.  No impacts to battery life.  I saw some reviewers say it won’t run Windows and this is not true.

  Great lightweight laptop. Hard to get used to the new command keys if you are not an apple user already. Great migration operation from other laptops even windows applications.  Not easy to fix or troubleshoot when necessary. Had to get tech support to correct a bug with the M1 chip(hard drive), it was fixed but took an hour on the phone

  APPLE makes the best computers!  Reliable, there are no viruses, and they have the amazing APPLE CARE support for all their computers.  I also learned tat the only reason to purchase their separate Apple Care insurance is if you are concerned about the computer hardware, such as a broken screen.  APPLE makes all your tech needs easier and is my first and only choice.
"
Alexander,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Unexpectedly this turned out to be a espectacular laptop. Yes, some applications are still not available natively for the M1 chip but even through emulation they are very fast to use. Camera despite having the same.720p res it has a better image quality and I assume this is due to the chip processing image better than intel. For everyday use this is perfect for other tasks such as programming not yet.

  I was skeptical at first but now I’m convinced!  ARM Is like the cpu in the terminator movies! lol. No fan and battery last all day easily!  It absolutely crushes my 6 core i7 MacBook Pro on Geekbench test!  You will not regret buying one!  Look at the picture and see for yourself!
"
Natzak,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased the MacBook Air assuming the computer was new because the item said “new”.  After a week of owning the computer and charging once. I decided to look at the battery cycle count and it read “14”.  Meaning it had been charged 14 times at full cycle.  I contacted Apple and they said testing involves 1-3 cycles.  I suspect it was already used heavily for a month.  So I returned it.  Very hesitant to purchase a laptop again from Amazon.

rob,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My son who is studying in Florida called me to tell that his MacBook (7 years old) has some small issues and he is worried it could fail during an important session exam/test which is mostly done online under corona. So we had to buy quickly a new MacBook but where not sure whether the M1 would do it without issues regarding standard programs you use on the daily university live (like Office366, Team viewer, GoodNotes, etc.) Now after 3 week my son tells that there are no issues what’s so ever and he likes the performance and as well as the Batterie runtime. The price and shipping time was good as well!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This laptop actually lives up to all the hype about the M1 chip and such. It is lightning fast, smooth, clear easy to read screen  and the battery lasts and lasts for all day and then some. Also I have noticed that with any normal use it doesn't even get warm so the lack of a fan is not a detriment but nice as a nonexistent fan can't make any noise. I was slightly skeptical but as a multiple APPLE owner not surprised I was happy. Seriously I just sent a 3 year old iPad that had been used hard daily for a battery replacement and received a brand new iPad 3 days after I sent it in. Thats service as well.
"
ja,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this because I've historically had a good experience with the longevity of my last Macbook air. I dislike the OS, I hate the ""magic"" keyboard with the weird 10 key placement, I hate the ""magic"" trackpad and it's the biggest waste of money I've spent, and most of all, I hate ""Numbers"", both the software & also now the word itself. Apple should ""think differently"" and stop causing problems when I'm saving an Excel file, deleting an entire day's work, which I don't think I've experienced before so it was a weird & interesting feeling. If this thing doesn't retain it's longevity, I'll just eliminate Apple from my life forever. The business cycle seems to be nearing.,Edit: Also for some reason, this thing just keeps restarting itself, the last few times I've used Excel. Did I get a lemon? I'm about to raise hell.

  I had a MacBook Pro 13 2015...that machine lasted a long time and I love it. It dropped and I needed a replacement fast. MacBook Air 2020 is not a disappointment. The battery life even if downloading is incredible. I had it downloading all night and I still have a charge. It was only a slow download because the internet speed sucks. The touch ID is a delight. I love the picture quality. So far I am so impressed. Hopefully it will last as much as the other lasted.

  I jumped from a 2010 model MacBook to this,I got the 256 fb 8gb model I produce music and honestly it’s been able to handle all of my plug ins and sound packs with ease...the touch buttons for the sound and brightness buttons are a much better practical way to go then the Touch Bar On the Mac Pro screen quality is solid and it’s really fast and smooth,If you have any doubts for buying this over the pro don’t doubt it...it’s extremely quiet and to be honest one music session I had was about 5 hours straight and the laptop was barely a little warm after all of that editing and recording on Logic Pro x....if you can afford it....it’s worth it....the only thing I think that I’m annoyed with it the fact that apple is still using a 720p webcam....it feels really lazy to me that I’m 2021 they chose to go with a 720p I think if they fixed that the laptop would be perfect

  I love my MacBook Air! I chose gold, it’s such a beautiful classy color. It came in original packaging packed very safely. I haven’t tried the camera yet.,I switched to iPads since 2010 and haven’t missed crashing windows one bit. I needed to do a few things my iPad wouldn’t do a Mac it was! The battery life is amazing, and the screen brightness is great, I’ve heard it isn’t bright as the MacBook Pro but I can’t believe anything would be brighter! I can’t put the brightness but half way up.

  I owned a MacBook Pro in the past. This time around, there was no real selling point for the pro. So I got the 512gb air, so that I get better storage as well as the 8 core gpu. the base only comes with a 7 core. I love this laptop, for light to medium gaming, media browsing and for productivity. This laptop hits it out of the park. Stupid fast, great battery and a wonderful premium feel that no other laptop can match. This apple m1 processor is a beast and should scare the heck out of intel. This baby plays Minecraft and high settings with good frame rate, and pairs up amazingly with my other apple devices. Apple is really pushing hard to bring a great product here, at a competitive price. In the thin and light laptop market, apple destroys the windows laptops in every way.

  Just have to say I'm really thrilled with the new M1 MacBook Air - worked all day (8+ hours) on a rather complex Excel workbook and the laptop never got warm and the battery is still at 43%! Can't say enough good things about this computer. The cost was within budget and the performance, well it's better than my iMac in many ways! Really glad I didn't wait for the next model to start enjoying Apple's new computer on a chip design. Thanks Apple!

  No issues with this MacBook, came in perfect condition, very easy to navigate, LOVE the Touch ID, and the camera quality is okay, not as good as a phone. The battery lasts about an entire day, and the charger that comes with it is super high quality. Buttons are very big and easy to see and push, the lighting on them is perfect. The touch pad being bigger is wonderful! Very light and easy to handle, get as much storage as you can afford. Able to do everything I need & more, 100% recommend.

  I don’t know why is asking me to review the touch screen because the computer definetely doesn’t have touch screen. Anyway, I bought the MacBook Pro expecting to be better than my old MacBook Air and honestly it’s just not worth it. It is NOT noticeably faster and the battery lasts long but only if you’re not using a lot of programs, which in my case as a college student I always have a lot of tabs open and quite often I need to work on programming softwares.,Cant play silly steam games like stardew valley without overheating the laptop.

  This is my first ever Apple product, and I am floored by the performance it has given me. I am a 5th-year Graphic Design student, and I was originally using a Microsoft Surface Pro, and the conversion to Mac was a MASSIVE upgrade!!! Especially with the use of the M1 chip. I'm able to produce videos using Adobe Software, which even on my Gaming WIndows PC, uses quite a large amount of RAM  and VRAM to render out, only use half of that with this laptop. Added in a 1TB SSD External and a Dock, and I am a happy man!!! Thank you, Apple!

  In general I love this MacBook Air. I have had other Apple products but this is my first laptop.  It has a great display, it opens easily with touch (fingerprint) ID, you can move easily from here to there and not lose any information. It is great for most purposes. The things I have had trouble with are the Apple word processing, spreadsheet or presentation programs, so I continue to use Office 365. That is not totally fair in this review as the device is wonderful!

Also, the battery life on this thing is unreal!!! I have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it. It is amazing!!!

The screen quality is great, but I had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area. Although, when I found some shade I had no problems at all. I am not outside much in the sun on the MacBook so this isn’t a big deal for me. Overall, great product in my opinion. It is perfect for what I need to do for work.

  We own a MacBook Pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks.  Bought the MacBook Air and are very pleased.  It's lighter than our pro, has similar performance, is a bit lighter and cheaper.  The only negative is that its two USBC ports are on one side, makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation.  Probably not an issue for most.  Oh, the battery life seems better than the Pro.  Definitely recommend it.

  This product is not cheap, it's not something that you normally could just drop loads of money on... good job if you can.,Take students perspective. Not much to my name and obviously in desperate need of something that can at least operate. Sure you can opt for something cheaper if you want something that just ""works"", however, if you want something that can get the job done, is reliable, absolutely beautiful, and long lasting that can beat any other laptop out of the park with the M1 processor... I'd suggest you get this laptop now.,Stop thinking about it honestly, just do it. Two days ago I was sitting here debating for so long if I should even go for it finally somehow having the funds. Regretting doing so even after placing my order. All that went away when I held this near magical product in my hands for the first time. You will never have to buy another laptop again for a long time if you simply take care of it. It's going to take me a long way into my education... as will it you and what you chose to use it for.,Happy M1'ing be productive!

Never have any of the dozen or so Apple Products I have actually bought I would call a good value, except for they work.  This is a whole lot of computer for the money however and not just a good value because they work the way they are supposed to, but finally I can say you get a lot for the money.

  Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version. Feeling deceived. In addition, the 8 GB RAM / 256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing. Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death. With a regular set of apps, like the MS Office suite, the disk fills up in no time. Now OS updates are not working, since they require at least 15 GB disk space. But - battery life is out of this world, with the CPU temp sitting at 36C!

  so my thoughts are on the M1 air version and I must say its a great machine for the price it's my first apple device as I'm a pc gamer but I had to have this because of the ARM chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x86 chipsets it's very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it...nothing at the moment beats the battery life it's great it has a great IPS display as well looks very vivid and sharp

  Love everything about my new computer except the bezelless screen compared to my older Macbook Air.  On old Macbook AIr you could adjust screen angel by grabbing the metal around the screen with out touching screen, Now with no bezel I leave fingerprints all along outer edge of screen. This is a minor inconveinence compared to the battery life and M1 processor that walks circles around 2017 Macbook Air.

  Pros. I Love the new M1 processor, I had an i5 MacBook air before this one that was fast, this one is to me compares to the i9 for speed.,Cons, I don't like that you have to buy an adapter to have a USB or to use my camera SD card, plus they took away the magnetic cord you charge with now it is just a plug-in like the Macbook Pro. Being a Computer tech I see problems in the future with it being a plug, they always seem to loosen up as the years go on. Other than that I LOVE IT!

  Will NOT support Apple's 2011 THunderbolt 27"" Display. I have spent hundreds of dollars on connectors/converters and dongles which do not work. Both Apple and Amazon have sent me around 10 items that DO NOT WORK. I have a tremor which makes it hard to work on a small screen.  I was informed that each of the solutions would work by both companies and other third-party sellers to whom they have directed me.  SHAME ON THEM! Apple is not my friend.

  My first time MacBook experience, there are many things to learn, my iPhone and iPad  experiences helps, that is the Apple system, its shares so many apps, functionalities, the  M1 chip is amazing, laptop never got warm and I use it for three or four days without charging.,I have migrated many window office documents to Mac, am still learning so far I'm impressed with the new Mac air. quality is top notch

  This purchase for me was an upgrade from a old MacBook Pro I’ve been using for over 4 years got a refurbished MacBook Pro 2012 for Christmas 4 years ago so I when I saw the 2020 MacBook Air new not refurbished for 899 bucks I jumped on it and I’m glad I did because it’s a great MacBook fast efficient I edit videos for YouTube everyday and this MacBook does it way faster than my old slow MacBook Pro so I’m very happy a must buy for sure
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value.  The package was secure and well-packaged, which was very important, given that this was delivered via mail.  No cracks on the screen.  The processing speed is quick, which is extremely helpful!  I appreciate there were instructions, in a small pamphlet, that explained how to transfer everything from your previous MacBook to this MacBook.  A seamless transition is vital and means less frustration.  This MacBook Air is very user friendly, especially visually.  As someone who wears glasses, I appreciate the option to make the pointer larger, the ability to have more contrast, etc...  That the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user-friendly.

  I needed to replace my 2015 MacBook Air since it was getting slow and I’m running low on storage.  It was an improvement but is not perfect.  Price wise it is an excellent buy and a lot cheaper than other Apple offerings.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to transfer data and applications using time machine with Apple migration assistant.  The display is outstanding. What I don’t like is the lack of ports and no MagSafe connection for power.  And I prefer Catalina over Big Sur but maybe I’ll get used to it.  Also if you plan on keeping it for more than a couple of years and take a lot of pictures or movies 256 GB is not enough memory.  Get at least 512.

Gloria Eugenia Chon Him Guzman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  muy buen producto y calidad. excelente pantalla, funciona perfecto el lector táctil, rápida al abrir pantalla entre muchas otras cualidades. RECOMENDACIONES: comprar un buen protector de la computadora, comprarle un multi conector de 12 en 1 y que trabaje por los 2 puertos USB-C para distribuir la carga y flujo de trabajo. Adicionalmente si su cartera aguanta comprar la version de 16gb de ram, hice pruebas de carga navegación, abrir y cerrar videos de instagram como 6 veces seguidas y me aparecía en pantalla que la carga de la pagina navegada consumía muchos recursos.

  Love my new MacBook Air!! Light, sleek, long lasting battery, plug & play! Surprised it does not have regular USB ports, but ordered 2-pack of USB to USB-C adapters for $10. Love all my Apple products from their packaging to their long lasting durability and fantastic performance/technology.

"
francis snyder,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had a Mac Air for the last 4 years worked very well , although a little slow on the upload download times but it was a rugged stout machine. The new one has already been repaired because of the track pad a a few keys sticking the track pad is awful as you can hover over it and it engages and sends without touching it and when you want to send it sometimes takes several clicks. Changing the settings causes it to slow down and delay transmission and there isn't a happy medium.  I have become used to it but when traveling in a car or plane it's obviously flawed. also upload / receiving times a mediocre at best score. I would pass till they work out the kinks in a couple of years.

  Bought 2 ipads, could not connect to internet, wasted money.  Bought an expensive phone, needed assembly, never worked, wasted money.  Bought a new MacBook, in setup after argument to use English, when I entered the Wi-Fi password 3 times, it never accepted it, it went nuts and sailed off into disability screens I could not fathom.  The touchpad seems not to work.  Does not have a USB port, without using an external mouse is less than junk to me.  Now we start pulling teeth, scheduled a return, will I get credit?,RUN FROM APPLE PRODUCTS ! ! !

Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first laptop my other Mac was a 21.5 desktop, so it has taken me a while to get used to it but I love it. It is light where I can take it from room to room. I do puzzles online and it took some time to figure how to make the screen just a little bigger but I am pleased with it. It is very fast andThe battery lasts quite a while I haven’t had an issue with it. Overall am very pleased with it.
"
Rempae,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great, however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications. I need a bunch of tabs open for my work, use Canva constantly, and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB. But that's my fault and the YouTube reviews faults, not the laptop. Battery life is amaaaazing though!
"
Billb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a great desktop. I have it paired with a Dell hi res display I purchased with my old Mac. My old Mac was getting unreliable (2015). This air is very similar to the Mac but faster, reliable. I like the larger touch pad and don't have to use a wireless mouse. I have a USB type C HUB to get more connectivity. Keyboard is great.
"
WriterFLP,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the battery life. It lasts so long that I charge it sparingly. I love the instant on feature when I lift the lid. I am impressed with the biometric scanner that allows me to log in without my password. The MacBook Air allows me to log in with my Apple Watch as well. The speed is fantastic. I am thoroughly impressed. I have an M1 Mac mini as well. I am hooked.

  I'm serious ..bought it dec. 14 and have never been able to use it! its crazy.. I guess I was hacked the moment I set it up? also you cant try to change the password unless you use another apple product. Dumbest thing I ever heard of! today is March 25th 2021 and no service at all!
"
Michael Lohsl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What’s not to like? It’s a great Apple product! Bought to replace a 2013 MacBook Pro that worked flawlessly right up until it was destroyed in an accident. Setting it up and getting on with my life was pretty seamless, as it has been on every Apple product I’ve ever upgraded. I’m enjoying the increased speed and more up to date features as a bonus — especially longer battery life!
"

  Cute, light and really (really) fast.,It is exactly what you need from a computer.,The only bad thing (for me) is that M1 chip does not support bootcamp.

teean,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this for school after my hp computer's battery stopped working. It's really great for the price! the screen resolution is really nice and the touch id is a good add on. I really wish apple would make touch screen macbooks but they probably never will. it also doesn't have a usb port which is kind of weird. learning the controls takes some time but overall a great computer!
"

Ana ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Yo compré esta computadora porque mi antigua laptop tenía seis años y me estaba causando muchas dificultades en mi trabajo y con mis clases. Entran en zoom era un problema y con está computadora no me ha pasado. Es la primera vez que tengo una Mac y aunque al principio me costó un poco acostumbrarme al sistema de apple, pero la rapidez y duración de la bateria valen la pena. Es muy fácil trabajar con esta computadora, mientras que con la otra podía esperar hasta una hora para que terminara de cargar un programa. La recomiendo.

  I love this laptop it’s very light it’s very thin the screen is a great size not too big not too small the battery life is great Mine did not come with the touchscreen but I really don’t have a need for it the keyboard is perfectly fine I highly recommend this laptop I can’t say anything bad about it would buy it again

  This is my very first MacBook! I’ve been wanting to have one but couldn’t afford it. I was using my Sony laptop since 2004 and it finally broke. I thought, if I was gonna buy a new laptop it should be MacBook so I did save some money for it, but my savings could only afford MacBook Air 2020. I love it! It’s looks cool and I enjoy using it and will probably use until it lasts lol.
"
Itmejaradd,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Like any laptop this laptop has its little quirks but overall this is one of the best laptops to purchase. I don't know if this is touchscreen but its not that big of a deal for a person like me . The picture/ video quality is great to look at and is very clear but the Photo Booth camera kinda sucks which is a little disappointing . Other than these little things the laptop is  pretty fast and  has all the essential app to create .

  I love my MacBook, battery is so good. Camera isn’t amazing but it’s pretty good, but you have to remember…. This is a laptop. Prefect for zoom!  So as long as your not taking your MacBook on a photo shoot, camera quality is great! Screen is small. But it’s fine! Lighter than a feather!
"
Gowing01,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Still learning some of the new features. Not sure if I like it better than the MacBook Pro. It is slow to come on at times and sometimes has to be fiddled with to get it to come on. Screen quality is good and speed is improved. Touch sensitive keys are taking some getting used to.

  The m1 MacBook Air is the perfect machine blending the best aspects of cell phone computing with the functionality of a laptop.

"
sspires,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am not computer savvy, but find this Mac to be easy to use.  I was limping along on a 12 year old MacBook Pro and could not even update to the new OS (Big Sur), so it was time.  I didn't need the big footprint of a MacBook Pro so this is a good fit.  I'm still finding my way around but so far, so good.

"
jana sprick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely wonderful and showed up charged and. ready to go. Make sure you migrate everything from your older Mac or have a solid time machine backup to transfer. Only downfall is it has no USB ports. Buy your year’s version of a Macbook Air to USB port and/or HDMI adapter at a minimum.

  Yes, there are ""thousands "" of apps available as advertised. They do not include popular apps such as Amazon, Facebook, Spectrum  Instagram or Sprint. Work related apps like Indeed and LinkedIn.

Works great for reading email and Facetime.

I ran into one issue where I shut it down to charge for some time and then when I tried to restart it it was just a black screen with the arrow on the screen and I had to do a hard restart on it. it has only done that once since I got this but so far I do love it. I have and apple iPhone, iPad, and an Apple Watch and it was very easy to get all systems on the same page.

  No complaints so far - in fact, I am actually very impressed! The battery life is incredible (although I have only had it for two days!) and the screen, keyboard, and body are great. I had a Macbook Pro (2012) eons ago and this is obviously far and above that.,I was a bit nervous buying from Amazon but I was impatient and couldn't wait the 2+ weeks it was going to take from Apple or Best Buy. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

  First time with a MacBook and it feels awesome. Nice OS, overall good look, sound and display have very good quality, battery life outstanding. The camera is mediocre though. I have always worked with windows and Linux and I’m getting used to this OS and I’m starting to love it. Similar feel when I was changing from Android to iPhone. I downloaded and installed Office 365 in a few minutes, for programming Python and Sublime Text work just fine. Safari works so fast! No complain after a week with this laptop

  I'm an Apple girl, using apple products most of my adult life.  This is the best computer that I have purchased.  The updates that they have made have made these computers even faster, quieter, and more.  Due to the updates on the MacBook Air, you can do as much with Photoshop, InDesign, iMovie, PremierPro, and music programs that you can with the MacBook Pros, only more compact.  I would definitely encourage you to grab this one if you have the opportunity to.

  I wanted to download shows from Netflix, etc. and use this on a plane without wifi, but Apple makes it impossible and really pushes you toward Apple TV. Don't buy this if you plan to use it for a similar purpose.

  Great computer very fast long lasting battery verily high quality
"
Cathie Neel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love the lightweight and easy to set up/configure capabilities.  This is my first MAC although I have iPads and an Apple watch.  Though it might be scary to move from Windows, but not at all.  Like all Apple products - everything was seamless.  Great price as well..
"
Génesis Vargas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Worst computer I’ve used. Screen dead after one month. Battery isn’t lasting long. Freezes and input output very slow.
"
Angela M. Gallagher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered a mouse with the laptop but haven't even taken it out of the box because the trackpad is so good. The keyboard is sweet and I love the TouchId feature. I'm coming from a Windows background and this was so easy to set up. I'm so happy with it. The battery lasts a long time. Everything about this laptop is a breeze. Glad I took the plunge.

  I bought this laptop on sept. 14 and received a defective one! On that date the item has been fully returnable! Now Amazon says that the item is not returnable (maybe they changed some policy after my purchase) that's it! In the item page we can see that  <<This item is non-returnable, but IF THE ITEM ARRIVES DAMAGED OR DEFECTIVE, YOU MAY REQUEST A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT. >> My item is DEFECTIVE but even now they don't accept my return and don't give me a label to return it... Amazon scamming people like you and me, so be carefull!

  Loved this computer. It has an Apple processor and I needed to split my drive for windows OS so I’ve returned it and got the one with an intel processor.

Janelle J,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I absolutely love love my new lap top! I had a Macbook Air in college and now I have one for working at home and for traveling if the desire arises! The price is great and the quality is excellent, I noticed other reviews commenting on the quality of the video, however I do not see it being grainy at all!
"
Francis King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very fast computer.  Lots pf fun for a first time Apple user.
"
Chris Andrzejewski ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So I have never bought any Apple laptops off Amazon but it did arrive wrapped and packaged as if it came from Apple itself. Battery life is great, keyboard is great and it’s light. I don’t use laptop cameras so I can’t say either way on how good it is or isn’t.
"
Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Almost everything is top-notch: Performance, battery life, new magic keyboard, usual unparalleled trackpad, quality of materials and build. I was a little concerned about lower screen brightness of MB Air versus MB Pro prior to purchase, but have no complaints. Only feature less than excellent is camera, which is only 720p. Limited ports only a minor inconvenience. Most highly recommended.
"
D. C. Froehlich,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Extremely light weight. LONG battery life. Perfect for travelling.
"
LautuLoman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I use this to teach online. Overall extremely satisfied. Fast, reliable and looks nice. The only two things I’m not crazy about are A) the camera isn’t really HD and B) I ordered gold and it looks more like a rose gold color.
"
Thomas S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have to reset this thing at least 5 times per week in the middle of meetings and such for no reason. I've done all the updates and it's brand new, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that it has an Apple chip instead of an Intel one, and like most things Apple actually makes its glitchy and unreliable. Makes sense that it was on sale. If you have to buy an Apple try to get the ones that have the fewest Apple parts as possible.
"
eckle75,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This has everything I could possibly want in a laptop and more! I love being able to use my fingerprint to access my laptop! It is thin and light for easy portability as well! Definitely recommend!
"
John Jack Rainmaker Common,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought the 8 gig ram model works great. Unless you’re running a lot of concurrent apps you don’t need 16 gig. This machine is fast and beautiful. By far the best laptop I found and believe me I thought a lot of them during the last 40 years!

"
Lynnette Kurth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This computer was described as used but like new, I would have guessed it was new because it looks brand new. It's the latest MacBook Air and I got it cheaper than through the Apple store. I was anxious to get it but shipping said it could take 3-7 days from when I ordered it. I was pleasantly surprised to get it on the third day. This is replacing my 2013 MacBook Pro Retina. I love it.
"
nicolas acero,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Best computer i have ever had, very good job Apple. Comparing to many brands HP, Acer, Dell, etc this is a rocket based on price, speed, image, performance, everything. just the best buy you can ever have, dont doubt it for a second.,Btw i rarely do reviews for stuff i buy but it deserves it, could not be happier!

David Charpentier,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Powerful laptop that can handle music production and djing softwares without problems. This computer is so light and thin that it is unbelievable how well it works.,There is no need to buy a Macbook Pro M1. Shop this one without hesitation.

"
shanice,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Battery life is great, once you are not doing to much things. I had a glitch with the mouse the first day I bought it. But I have not seen it again from that day. It is portable, nice slim laptop, not heavy, work well so far. Camera quality is not so good, I think apple could have updated their camera quality, but it is fine anyways, usable. The speakers are loud and nice. Nice sound quality.
"

"

  Love the MacBook Air. I ordered GOLD.  Beware, it’s a rose gold.  From what I understand from different sites and YouTube that it is rose gold.  Was hoping it was the color of my iPhone gold.

  I've needed a new laptop for years and finally decided to buy one, but had not planned on purchasing a MacBook.  After reviewing many options I clearly made the right choice.  I love it!!!,DW
"
CJR,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love MAC laptops. They are reliable and this one has the newest processor which is very fast and the screen has no frame. The only issue that this causes is a lot of finger smudges from opening it or adjusting the screen.
"
Giovanny Cruz Durán,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Llegó en algo menos de dos días. Está Macbook air M1 es lo mejor de lo mejor. La capacidad de memoria es asombrosa. La rapidez parece indicar que Apple se ha adelantado muchos años.

"
Cardomi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I often need to take conferences away from home and any source of power to charge my laptop, as a previous owner of a gaming laptop, it was a terrible situation to be in since battery wouldn't last longer than 2 hours. I decided to buy this laptop specifically for the long battery claims, and it was my best decision ever. No longer need to worry about low battery levels, M1 chip is a step up.
"
Mark Enfield,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this machine. I should have switched to mac long ago. Fast response, great screen, keyboard is sweet touchpad is fantastic.
"
D. R. Banta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The new M-1 chip makes it worth the change...fastest Mac I've had, for a ""reasonable"" amount if I can make it last 10 years...only criticism is that the touchpad is to big and they jammed the fingerboard up too much for me.
"
elainefrodo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
TJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a very good product. Good price, and this is my first mac ever. I like this! BTW, if you have an issue with the delivery process, the seller will support you. But first, you have to check with FedEx costumer service(they can investigate for you). I promise the product is very nice!

Meghan Dushko,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I never owned a Mac before and I am very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous about ordering it off Amazon at first but it was slightly cheaper and came in exactly two days. No issues with damages or overall quality. Screen quality/graphics are great. I am able to play most of the computer games I wanted to on here with no overheating issues. Battery lasts a while depending on what I am doing and charges very quickly.

  The connections are really lacking on this laptop, but everything else is consistent with what you'd hope from an Apple product. Over priced, but good quality and decent support. Buy the additional warranty or Apple care.

"
Richard P. Adler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve owned three MacBook Airs over the years and this is the most capable to date. Processing speed and battery life are excellent, and the screen is outstanding. I’m still getting used to having just two USB-C ports. I had to purchase an external hub to connect to an external monitor and an external hard drive and I especially miss not having a built in SDHC card reader.
"
E. Leopold,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  With my current Apple computer showing it’s age, buying a new Apple MacBook was a know brainer. It is convenient, easy to use, fits into my Apple world and it is an Apple.
"

"
DodoDance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THIS PURCHASE IF YOU ARE A MAC PERSON.  IT IS GOOD FOR PC PERSONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT, AS IT IS DIFFERENT FROM A PC.  SOME SOFTWARE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND.
"
Timothy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The battery life in this laptop exceeds everything I've ever seen before. On a full charge after being on standby for a week I still have 90% battery left. In the past I've always been afraid to leave my laptop for any period of time without shutting it down. Now I never shut it down. an occupational reboot after an update or something is all it needs.
"

  This was a gift for Christmas for my daughter who will be graduating in May 2021 and going off to college.  So, I wish I could give more feedback on it, my oldest has a bigger apple laptop and loves it for her school assignments she’s in a nursing program.
"
Alex Bustamante,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  M1 chip blows away any laptop on the market. It even blows away the pro version of this laptop. No internal fan and loss of efficiency is virtually non existent. Highly recommend

"
Juan Puerto,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This laptop is great. It's fast, slim and battery life is pretty awesome. The camera isn't the best and I don't love Apple's new keyboards, they have very little travel. Besides that I'm very pleased with my purchase.
"
Twanna,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Battery life was wonderful. However, multiple issues with interacting with Zoom; which was a central reason for purchasing the MacBook. I have an Apple phone and thought a MacBook would be a great addition. Unfortunately, that was not  the case for me. If you aren’t familiar with MacBooks, it takes some adjusting to go from a laptop to a MacBook. I ended up returning the MacBook and purchased a laptop instead.
"
John A. Duncan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Dedensyde,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

MK,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't get the hype about M1 chip. Half of my programs aren't compatible with it and some aren't updated anymore so there is a little hope for a fix. The camera is horrible as well, picture quality is worse then what my 3 years old smartphone produces

"
Jeff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This MacBook is super fast and convenient to use. Typical Apple quality but yes you will have to pay a price for it.  The M1 chip is amazing and worth it.  Wish the bezels weren't as big but you can't get everything right?  Highly recommend if you are a fan of Apple. Very lightweight and portable.

Austin Schaffer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ive had this computer for 2 months now, and I still can’t find a single thing to complain about. The battery will last me 12 hours of gaming, something I didn’t think was even possible out of a high-performance laptop. When I say high performance, I mean it. This thing runs Minecraft on 60 fps with fancy graphics and 24 chunks of render distance; and it doesn’t even get hot! This is probably one of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Primarily used for photo editing and some light graphic design on the go with Photoshop and works flawlessly for that.  Super fast with the M1 and the battery lasts seemingly forever under normal use.  No issues with the screen cracking either after over a month of use taking it out every day.

  This is definitely better than my HP, in which I've had for 3+ years. It runs a lot smoother and it's more portable . The camera quality is also better. I would highly recommend it to anyone that needs something new.

  I’ve never used a Mac before but I was able to learn to use this easily with the tutorials.  Very user-friendly.  When I use my husband’s PC now it seems like a dinosaur.  Love this!

  I have waited a long time to buy a MAC and I am not disappointed! I was surprised at what is inside the machine, incredible! Great price!
"
Mark McKnight,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Unbelievable difference from my prior Air. So much faster. I have run into a couple of small issues with software due to the new chip, but I'm sure they'll release new versions soon. The main one for me right now is that Google FIle Stream doesn't work. I found a substitute called odrive which works to sync w/ Google, but it is a paid product. Hope that's fixed by Google soon.

Michael S. Shifflett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This MacBook is amazing. I have been waiting years for apple to get away from intel. The M1 chip is amazing. The battery lasts all day. If you are on the fence about a new laptop it’s time to make the leap.
"
Ha Nguyễn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was a bit concerned when I saw the reviews saying that its camera was really bad because I teach online and do a lot of Zoom video calls. But it's so much better than my old PC laptop and might be as good as my iPhone 8 Plus camera. I am shook!

"
Tiphani Dean,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Computer was not able to charge are a monthe or so. Took to Apple reps stated could not help me that day because Amazon is a 3rd vendor.
"
N. Aeder,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

Raquel MacDonald,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The one we received worked just fine. However, it’s uneven so when I try to sit it on a flat surface to type, it rocks. Rather annoying and something I never thought of before.
"
I. Rilke,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Ivan Batista Jr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first laptop and I’m real happy with the purchase. The speakers on this are nice and loud I love it. The size is a great size, not too big and definitely not too small, it’s just right. The screen is great too love the picture quality and it gets brights. I’m not super in tune with all the laptop lingo and things that matter but as a person who just bought their first laptop, definitely worth it.

"
JG,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm a mac guy and have been purchasing mac products for years.  I was taken back by the camera quality on this product.  It was strange that the 2015 macbook air that I sold before getting this 2020 version had a much better camera.  The camera quality is horrible.  It almost looks like a camera from 2001.  Other than that the product is great, and does what it needs to do.
"
alisha fore,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Was bought as a graduation gift for my daughter. Display quality and sound from the built in speakers is exceptional. She currently  only uses it for Netflix and YouTube until college starts in a few weeks though lol.
"
brinton Duncan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This would have been great, the computer is epic.  But why do you default to gold?  I bought this under a timeline to bring overseas and they sent me a gold version, like who wants that? I returned it and it's been over two weeks and haven't gotten any refund, so it's just been a whole mess that could have been avoided.  Stop defaulting to a color no-one wants.  Rant over.
"
C A M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  You get what you pay for, and that $1000 I dropped on this MacBook was worth. I went through a few cheap laptops that went from $200-400 bc I needed it for my college classes and then after wasting my time buying and returning them,  I finally decided to go all out and no regrets with this purchase. 10/10
"

"
michelle eubnk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love my MacBook!! But it was delivered by a over packed uhaul and left in its side out side without knocking to let me know it was there,?to sign for it, not any safeguards in place. I am grateful for the thoughtful packing on your part because it was shipped in an oversized box and no extra packing, it moved freely within the box.
"
Steve McNicol,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

   I absolutely love it! Bought it because I’m a math major in college and it’s just what I needed! It charges fast and stays charged! I never shut my computer down but put it to sleep and battery is still good! I haven’t used it to it’s max ability so I’m not sure 100% of what it can and can’t do! It’s light and is gorgeous.

Mackenzie Montgomery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  despite what other comments on here have said i still bought it and so far i've had it for about a month and its perfect, small and useable fast and ever since i broke my other macbook (which was a macbook air btw) i've never been happier with this new one, i love the new features it adds and it was certainly a good investment

DC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Did not like the color. The gold is NOT gold, rather rose gold. So this is a misrepresentation on the color. If you think it will be true gold color, you will be disappointed. It looks and is rose gold has a pink color to the gold.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First time owning a MacBook, I didn't want to cheap out on a good computer for school so I chose this and it does not fail to deliver.

"
bruno botton,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple notebooks are great and work smoothly, however it is inconceivable that such an expensive and top machine does not support 2 external monitors such as the previous macbookair with intel chip does.,On top of that there are only 2 USB C ports, so that any additional connection must come with expensive connectors.

  an excellent option, for work, have some problem with docker!! (for developers guys) the rest all very well, the screen, and the sound, and options are good, we only recommend a base for MacBook, for some heat in the down of the laptop, but I think is because don't have Forced ventilation for the Processor.

  The best Macbook ever. The screen is very beautiful and amazing performances. I had a mid2021 MacBook Pro, it still works well but I decide it’s the time to upgrade. M1 chip is really great, it makes MacBook Air powerful as like to MacBook Pro. I will buy some more for my son and daughter

Highly recommend this laptop for those who don’t need the highest specs but, can get by doing mostly everything you throw at it just fine.
"
SVP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I think this laptop is overrated. Reviews say it does not get hot but with only 10 minutes of playing some games, it went super hot that i had to turn it off. The M1 processor which they say is powerful did not live up to all the hype. No wonder it's cheaper than dell xps 13.

  First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.

  Had to take computer to Apple care center because after spending 3 hours in the phone with Apple support they couldn’t help me anymore. Thankfully  computer was under warranty so I didn’t pay  and they were able to fix it but the closest apple care was 2 hours from my home. Computer works great now though!

  Macs use to be quite a great computer, however, this computer tends to crash with certain programs (adobe and blender.) No ports for SD cards, or USB. (I bought numerous external ports (spent at least $60 on numerous devices) and still I am always forgetting them. I would at least love this feature to come back and/or will to pay extra for this feature.  This is probably fine for most users but for anyone working with arts, graphics and using different programs etc. this is a real inconvenience. Mac has continued to make its products less compatible with other computer brands.. Overall this will be my last MacBook, the drop and drag, and numerous features that made this a great computer and easy to use, were awesome but are no longer worth it. Oh yeah, also I lost numerous movies that I had purchased off of my iTunes, I contacted the iTunes customer service and no help.  Pretty much I am sad, and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules, like not only needing memory space on the computer (which mine is not full) but my icloud is full, after only 5 or 7 months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop.  So I watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless, and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them. So now I changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and I can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop. Apple has been a throne inside and I caution those who are working on arts, coding etc. to save the stress and frustration and stray away. This computer is pretty much an iPad for people that don't want ipads...
"
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First off, let me say, I'm speaking as a tech enthusiast with a decent understanding of gizmos and gadgets. I've owned Windows PCs, a MacBook Pro 2014, and a few Chromebooks. This is, by FAR, my favorite computer that I've ever used. Period. Let me start with my favorite aspects/features, in lovely bullet points for your viewing pleasure:,-Battery life. Oh my god. I have to TRY to kill this thing in one day. Full brightness, playing The Sims 3 or World of Warcraft, Spotify playing, Safari AND Chrome open in the background... I went from about 100% to 85% in an hour. And that's the most I could do. Usually, I start the day at full battery, then use it on and off all day, and the lowest I've gotten so far is ~40% by bedtime. It. Is. Insane. Not to mention the standby, which is basically 1-2% drop in a day. I cannot stress how amazed I am by the efficiency of this machine.,-Speakers. Okay, I know some people don't mind a tinny little laptop speaker because they use headphones. But I am not that person, I like to be able to just play music or videos out loud and enjoy them. Well, these speakers are also the BEST I've ever heard on a laptop. It's got such a full, defined, crisp sound, I can hear a lot more of the dynamic range and background effects than any other laptop I've used. It also gets LOUD, I can use it to fill my room with sound, and in fact I've had to turn it down a bit at night because my roomies down the hall can hear it. The bass is the only point that isn't a home run, but for what it's worth, I can definitely hear the bass. It just doesn't boom. Overall, amaaaazing!,-Keyboard. Short and sweet, this is my favorite keyboard. The previous spot was my 2014 MacBook Pro, but this surpasses that. The keys travel well, I make less mistakes, and it's quiet and comfortable. Not much else to say, it's just really good.,-Screen. Still a gorgeous Retina display, crisp, bright AF, colorful, and easy on the eyes thanks to True Tone. I'm not an artist or video editor, so this is just coming from an average consumer.,-Touch Bar. I know this is a divisive opinion, but I personally really like the Touch Bar! Some apps take advantage of it, and it really helps. Spotify keeps the controls on the bar, so I can switch and adjust music without having to switch back to the app. The sliders for brightness and volume are easy to press and slide, and frankly I just enjoy it. Touch ID on the corner is also LOVELY for logging in, making purchases, or filling forms out on webpages. One touch and you're good. Brilliant.,-Form factor. I love this skinny slab of aluminum. I'm a minimalist, and it just pleases me to hold and look at. This is completely subjective, but I'm a fan.,-Speed. Oh my god. This thing is legitimately the fastest computer that I've ever used. I'm honestly shook at how easily it handles anything I throw at it. It runs World of Warcraft on High settings at 60fps. No other MacBook could do that, the 8 core graphics chip really lives up to its specs. I can have tons of tabs open, a game, things updating in the background, and this guy doesn't break a sweat. All while absolutely SIPPING battery.,-Fans. Yes, the main difference between this and the M1 Air is that the Pro has an active cooling system. That being said, I've heard the fan come on about 3 times in 3 weeks. Even when running all that stuff I said before. I'm befuddled by how great the thermal dissipation works in this thing. It's good that it has fans, even if it barely uses them.,Less good but still aight:,-USB-C ports. Yes, there's only 2 on the left side. Yes, I had to buy an adapter for HDMI and USB-A. Am I mad about it? Not really, I only need to use those things when I'm docked at a desk anyway. I use a bluetooth mouse or the touchpad, and I have AirPods for headphones. So I don't need to plug many things in anyway. But if you do, definitely invest in an adapter. I use one by Anker, with 3 USB-A, an HDMI, and an ethernet port.,-To add to the USB-C impressions, I still miss MagSafe, so I actually purchased a ""magnetic"" USB-C cable, which you put the receiver in the MacBook USB port, and the cable magnetically attaches to it, just like the old MagSafe. This makes me feel safer, because a firm USB-C cable sticking out the side makes me nervous, if I were to drop it or hit it on something and mess up the port. Highly recommend a cable like this.,-Price. It's expensive, there's no way around that. But I'd consider it an investment, because generally speaking, Macs last many many years over their Windows counterparts. And since this is the first to use Apple silicon, I'm sure it will be supported for a long while.,-Webcam. It's just not great. The AI enhancements are definitely noticeable and make you look better, but at the end of the day, its a 720p webcam in a $1300+ computer. Come on apple, is 1080p that hard to add?,-App compatibility. While I have had almost no issues, some apps may not play nice with the M1 right now. The only real issues I had were that The Sims 2 Deluxe collection does not work, which I discovered is an issue for everyone with the M1 Macs. But luckily the devs say theyre working on a fix, so hopefully it's just a small number of apps with issues. Other than that, every other app has worked great.,Verdict: I love this computer. Sometimes I just sit and marvel at it. Sometimes I pick it up just to feel how nice it fits in my hands. It is legitimately my favorite computer, and if you're willing to make the investment, I think it's a fantastic computer for most people. If you don't need the Touch Bar or extra oomph from the fans, the M1 Air might be for you. But for me, man, the M1 MacBook Pro is THE laptop king. Or queen. 5 stars from me!,Update: I've had the MBP for about 2 months now, and I'm still completely in love with it. I stream on Twitch, and I can run OBS, a game like World of Warcraft, Spotify, Discord, Safari... all without a hiccup. The only real time I get the fans running is when I do this. I have seen the temperature of the cores spike to about 204 degrees Fahrenheit under load, but it's never shut down. It throttled once, as I noticed a slowdown, but I was running literally all those apps plus a discord video call, so I assume either the 8GB of ram couldn't handle it, or the cores got too hot. I was really pushing it though. Battery is still amazing, and I can run WoW Classic on max settings easily. Overall, still impressed, and still my favorite machine EVER!

Tyler,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Let me start off the apple ecosystem is great but what really disappointed me after 2 months of use the screen starting getting bright spots along the bottom and left side and eventually turned into a mess of different colors rendering that part useless. I got a quote from apple for 755 dollars to fix the screen including parts and labor and a 2 month wait time. I also had major connectivity issues with usb products using apples adapter too. It seems as if apples quality has gone down hill lately and this has pushed me away from apple. This will be my last apple product I purchase sadly

book reader,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  On a positive note, keyboard problem has been solved. But new annoyances have been introduced. I'm back to transferring pictures by wire. Airdrop is too hit and miss, works, but barely. Internet search for solutions shows me I am not alone. I've been on for three hours now, charging, and I've gone from 13% to 9%. Sluggish connectivity with bluetooth and internet compared to my Macbook Air of 2018, sitting next to one another on the same wifi network. All kinds of little annoyances also with that bar on top. It is useless, but for sound you have to use it and it is more cumbersome than the simple old way. Overheats once a day. I wish I had not bought it. The screen quality is great and I have a TB of memory. But as far as speed and ease is concerned, this thing is a trip back in time, back to Steve Balmer's Microsoft and its contempt for consumers.

  I was intending to upgrade from my 2018 Macbook pro. This new M1 silicone computer sucks.,it's not compatible with lots of programs, and keeps on giving me blue screen and restarts from time to time, not to mention it's ALWAYS freezing up on just web-browsers.,Waste of purchase.
"
Nathan Hjelm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am still waiting on delivery of my 13"" Macbook Pro but have been running with an M1 Mac Mini (same processor). So far I am blown away (but not surprised) by the performance. For software development workloads the M1 is 2-3x faster than my 2019 Core i7 16"" Macbook Pro. A compile that takes ~6m on the MBP takes ~3 on the M1 Mac. Performance benchmarks with Open MPI are roughly 2-4x better for both latency and bandwidth. And this is before any additional optimization work.,For gaming I tested the M1 with a native build of World of Warcraft. The game was playable (30+ fps) at ultra (level 10) outputting 1440p on a 27"" display. The fans do spin up but you never hear them. The 16"" Macbook Pro has a AMD Radeon 560 and struggles to be playable at level 6 on the internal display. The Macbook pro also gets incredibly hot.,Tried a couple of older x86 Windows games (Portal 1 and 2 from Steam) with Crossover 20 and they were playable at high graphics. Very impressive given these are running under Rosetta 2.

  1- Connecting an iPhone/iPad will brick all apps that didn’t come preinstalled. I can no longer add music or audio books to my mobile device. No big deal, just cause I travel a lot why would that be an inconvenience.,2- Safari is hit and miss on playing videos (Had to install chrome to play online videos).  So much for not using google.,3- External monitor does not wake from sleep. Requires a restart. If I had known I was, going to have to restart my computer every time it goes to sleep I would have bought a Windows computer.,4- Most of my 3rd party apps are buggy. I expected that would be the case for a while.,5- Bluetooth is buggy, Generally takes several attempts to get something paired.,6- No card reader! really!!! Easy enough to add, but still.,I’ve always known that MacOS doesn’t play well with non apple products, now it doesn’t even play well with their own products.,I am totally disappointed in Apple's quality control.,I didn’t expect to spend $2000 on a computer and have to restart and trouble shoot just about every time I use it. If I could do it all over I would stick with the intel processor.

Pippi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this laptop in late January. By May, the display was suddenly filled with random lines and blocks. The Genius Bar assistant ran a test, found the laptop had no scratches, and promised that only the top case and display would be changed. Despite my skepticism about the quality behind the Macbook Pro M1 that only lasted 4 months of usage, I accepted the repair. One week later, I went back to the Apple store and casually checked the repaired laptop’s case. There were scratches around the top case logo. There was a dent on the bottom case edge. After I brought up these issue, the Genius Bar assistant became nervous and tried to run a diagnosis test. He couldn’t because one of the USB C port was broken. After checking the only other USB C port, the battery was entirely drained and failed the diagnosis test. The cost of the AppleCare repair was quoted $500, but the damages it caused was probably close to $1000 if not more. I bought a brand new $1400 Macbook Pro that in a few months, had turned into a beaten, refurbished product through AppleCare.

  As a reference, I've used PC's since the 70's (Northstar), IBM PC products since the early 80's, and Mac products since the early 90's.  I have used the computer as a consumer, a software developer, and an electrical engineer.,Reviewed Product: 2021MPB M1 Chip 8MB RAM.,I've had four MBPs since 2014 between home and work.,Apple Mac started as a great computing platform, but it has become progressively worse.,Apple is losing their grip.,Problems with this PC:,1.  Fewer ports.  This one has only two, which considering one is for charging, this actually has only one usable port.  There is no port on the right side of the computer, save an obsolute analog audio port that nearly nobody uses any more.,2. Reliability.  This Mac continuously locks up and requires reboots.,The only good feature of this Mac is that the keyboard works, which was not a usable feature in the prior Mac generation.  Funny how fixing something that was clearly wrong in a prior generation is seen as an improvement.,I have not run any different software on this than any of the others, so it is frustrating to see Apple move in the wrong direction.,I'm quickly losing faith in the Mac platform.,On the positive side, battery life is awesome.  I would trade that for the other features that Apple lost the recipe for, like reliability and a usable set of ports.
"
Matt Wegner,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had my Macbook Pro M1 (8gb, 256gb storage) for 2 or 3 months now... I can honestly say I regret purchasing this so much. It works well a lot of the time but there's too many little issues that've piled up at this point. People familiar with Mac, no need to read on. If you are used to working on a Windows machine, read this before proceeding:,Conclusion: the chip is fast and it's an awesome piece of hardware, but the laptop is fairly clunky and buggy when extending to montiors/working together with DisplayLink. If your primary use case will NOT be external monitors, then i think you will be pleased. If you do extend the display, you're in for a treat.,Pros:,Greater battery life - it's true, this thing lasts a long time,Great screen - I am a big fan of the high resolution which lets you see more of the screen, and it's a bright screen as well.,Good sound - the built-in speakers sound very solid,General Performance - when it comes to web pages and the like, it performs well. I am not a power user and thus haven't really 'pushed' this thing with any depending programs so i can't speak to that,Cons:,COMPATIBILITY - I have used this by itself as well as with a Dell D6000 docking station which requires DisplayLink. I am extending to dual Dell 27"" 1440p 144hz monitors. For whatever reason, DisplayLink hates Mac... VERY often, Chrome/Safari will crash on launch. I can't emphasize this annoyance enough. Yes, I've circumvented the problem by finnicking with the DisplayLink program and unplugging/replugging in the Thunderbolt cable... it shouldn't have to come to that.,When i try and listen with my Airpods, a lot of the time the bluetooth connection will drop and the sound will want to play out of my laptop external speakers.,Another thing on performance - as mentioned above, it generally performs well, but honestly this thing takes too long to start up after being fully powered off. I had a laptop with an SSD before that turned on probably 3x quicker than this. And certain programs like Spotify take a surprising amount of time to load. One thought: I saw a video of someone clicking through and opening all the programs on their dock and they popped up immediately. This laptop does not do that.

Mary A. Najera,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ordered this MacBook Pro for my business as I already had bought my first one from Costco. One from Costco is still working great, never a problem. Needed a second one for my business and thought oh Amazon has a better price than what I paid for my first one . Went ahead and ordered from Amazon… used 2x and put it away for the next 2 weeks.. Needed to start using it more and surprise, surprise,Beach ball of Death came on! No amount of restarting it fixed it.. Amazon customer service offered to help me fix it…,Whaaat, brand new expensive electronics shouldn’t have to be fixed after using it2x… Returned and will never buy a laptop from Amazon. Had to chase my refund for almost a month till finally it was refunded today .. Be Ware!
"
Charles,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Try to do any of the normal, everyday tasks that a professional creator must do - transfer files from one hard drive to another, connect external monitors - anything.  You will find this product makes those things difficult, if not impossible.  Only two ports, one of which must provide power, means a constant juggling act with dongles, most of which will dramatically reduce transfer speeds over a direct usb-c connection.  Try finding a dongle with four USB-c connectors.  You can't.  I don't know why apple, in it's perpetual arrogance, decided us peasants didn't need external connections, but it makes this lightning-fast M-1 chip a real dud.
"
Macuser,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The hype: ""15-20 hours of battery life"" In Reality a fully charged battery is depleted after only 4-8 hours of web browsing which is not much different than the previous Intel Macbook 13 inch.,The hype: ""Crazy fast - faster than a $15,000 MacPro desktop"". Reality: Only slightly faster than the previous Intel Macbook 13 inch.  Maybe 25% faster.  Not a huge difference. Like today a little 3 minute 4K video took 45 minutes to render.,The hype: ""Stays so cool, fans don't come on"".  Reality: Fans come on rendering even a short little 2 minute 4K video.,New Irritations: Since this M1 Mac comes with the newest Big Sur operating system and Mac programs; e.g. Safari/Mail /Pages/iMovie, etc programs, I find the new versions less legible and less easy to figure out how operate.  Also alot of infurting system hangs and BEACH BALLS !!. This slows down my work.  Overall, I think if you have a 2016 on up Intel Macbook Pro, you should NOT get the M1 Pro unless you all you expect is a minor, almost unnoticable speed boost.
"
naplesinsider,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Don't believe the hype.  With 8GB (supposedly more than adequate due to new design) this is slower than 5-year old MacBook air it replaced. It is also buggy, for example the print queue does not work at all (a known bug also experienced by others).  Massively overrated.

Nick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had countless laptops and desktops, some that are even more expensive than this one. I've never been more content with a computer before. I don't even know where to begin. The best part is probably how fast it is. I bought it early one and have had it for about a year and a half. I do everything on it from studying, to watching movies, to downloading games. It seems just as fast and smooth as it did before. I even was able to partition the hard drive to get windows and you would be surprised at its ability to run games at medium graphics settings as well. Battery life is also stellar. I don't know what the advertised length is, but just to give you a clue I leave for lecture every morning with 100% battery, use it anywhere between 6-10 hours throughout the day, and always return home with a lot of battery life to spare. No more lugging around chargers in your backpack. Display is awesome.,I don't really have any cons to it. Anything ""negative"" is really just small stuff, and the only thing I can think of is I just wish it had more ports. But that is really nitpicking. I honestly don't use the touch bar that much, but it looks cool and doesn't really take up space if you don't use it so that does not matter. If you're looking for a laptop that is a jack of all trades, this is it.
"
John R. Pepp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The only reason I didn’t buy this at Amazon as I like dealing with Apple directly in case I have any issues.,First the pros:,1. The computer is fast and very portable. So far I am digging the M1 chip.,2. Surprisingly the computer is reasonably priced and is cheaper to the PC competitors. You can probably find affiliated links to find it cheaper here on Amazon. Like I said I like buying directly from Apple.,The Cons:,1. I wished the screen was a touch screen as I find myself wanting to press the screen. LOL,2. I wish it had more ports, but Apple over the years have been frugal in that department.,I highly recommend this computer.
"
John Erik Krische,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  To start I want to give full disclosure. I didn't buy this laptop on amazon and I have the 16gb model, so my experience won't 100% match yours, as amazon only sells the 8gb model.,To start, I am a pc guy. always have been and still am for the most part. Intel Mac laptops never really were appealing to me as they always seemed overpriced for the performance you would get, and as such apple laptops never really stood out to me. Well that was, until apple silicon released. When I first heard the announcement for apple silicon, I was skeptical It could compete with intel chips. but when I saw the benchmarks, I knew apple had created something special.,First, the battery life. I usually get around 10 hours on a charge with a normal workload of word processing, watching videos and listening to music at around half brightness. a long shot from the advertised 20 hours of battery life, but that figure was taken with ideal circumstances and lower brightness. Now 10 hours battery on a laptop isn't unheard of, but considering the other two strengths of the laptop, performance and thermals, it more impressive than it would usually be.,Performance is great, easily matching or beating much of Intels 11th gen lineup, and thermals are outstanding. In the few weeks I've owned the laptop, I have only heard the fan turn on during benchmarks, and even at full load, the cpu barely gets above 60 degrees c, far lower than the toasty 95 degrees that the intel chips get to under load.,The screen is great, but as an apple product that is to be expected.,Now all of this is great, but it all comes with one massive caveat; Rosetta. Now rosetta is great. it allows basically all intel software to run on the computer, and this is great if you are a pro user waiting on software developers to update to native code, but its bad if you have, for example, chat software that hasn't been updated. even simple programs running under rosetta chew the battery life, and that isn't ideal at all.,In the end, this laptop is great. It is very powerful, quit, cool, and fast. the only thing currently holding it back is lack of native software support, and as apple silicon matures I expect that issue to be solved eventually. Overall I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone that is willing to pony up the steep asking price.

  I went into Apple the other day & got one of the lovely estimates to fix the display of my last pro. I ended up just buying a new computer because of the price & I was a bit annoyed about it. The guy at Apple talked this computer up like crazy & I begrudgingly bought it.,This is the best laptop I’ve ever owned. The keyboard is different than the last pros & feels more like the air. They are so much better. The display feels like when you leave the eye doctor with a new prescription, you forgot there were leaves on trees. It’s beautiful. I haven’t gotten a lag in WoW yet. I’m so impressed.

  This is probably the worst experience I've ever had with a company. I received the laptop , everything worked fine for several weeks and then all of a sudden every program causes a the laptop to crash. Brought it to the Apple store twice, they say everything is fine (after a clean format the issue still happens). It was sent out for repair, same issue happening on a clean disk. Their first suggestion is to send it out for a 4th repair... seriously? You would think that clearly their diagnostic tools aren't correct if they are not able to detect an obvious issue like this.. especially for a 1-2 grand computer. I hope I'll never have to run into customer support with this company again.

  Really disappointing memory, I have the 8gb and it feels really really slow, I opened 8 sites in the Safari browser, and a few other little things and it's really slow. I constantly worry about closing some of what I opened, which really bothers me at work.,My previous computer moved much faster,MacBook Air 2013 a1466 with 8gb 256 gb ssd  memory worked fine.,The m1 has a really weak memory . I'm disappointed . After 8 years I was expecting a more powerful MacBook Air 2013  with the same level of memory.

Hidekel Uriarte,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the seamless integration and interactions it has with my Apple Watch, AirPods, and iPhone. I know people who don't have more than one Apple device hear all the time that having more than one always works great because of the ecosystem but usually only take it at face value. I was one of those people even up until I had my Apple Watch for a while but the MacBook really hooked me in. Once you realize how everything just works you don't know how you were able to do it before. Of course there is the whole walled garden argument everyone that dislikes Apple love to talk about but in reality I don't care if this walled garden is at war the rest of the world it's the best, most simple, and seamless ecosystem for the average consumer. There is a learning curve for those that come from other operating systems like the different feel of the keyboard, shortcuts, trackpad, and overall OS. But I've only been using this device for short while and already caught on super quick. I feel like despite all these positives there is still the high price. I purchased the 512 GB model and it came to around $1400 with a sale so it might take a while for the slight buyer's remorse to go away but I feel like the more I use it the quicker I become satisfied with my purchase. My final thoughts would have to be, if you have the money to purchase this at any configuration then go for it. Simply keep in mind there is a lot that goes into the satisfaction for this product; the ecosystem which would require more apple devices, the willingness to learn a new OS, understanding the added level of security and privacy that comes with Apple devices and the use case for each individual.

  Overall a great piece of hardware, if used on its own or with 1 external monitor. However, this laptop does not support more than 1 external monitor. I tried everything, including buying dongles and trying 3rd party workarounds.,There may be a way, if you spend a lot of time and buy extra add-ons. However, for a premium laptop, it is unthinkable that 2 monitors are not supported. My budget ASUS laptop does this without issue.,I have heard that Intel macs don't have this issue. I suggest holding off on M1 if you plan to use multiple screens.
"
Photohobbyist,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have used several MacBooks over the years: MacBook 2007, 2009, MacBook pro Late 2013, MacBook Air 2017, iMac 2019, Intel MacBook Pro 2020 and the M1 MacBook Pro 2020.,Before buying the M1 MacBook Pro 2020, I had the Intel Core i5 MacBook Pro 2020 for a few months and was the worst machine of the group. That machine heated so much that my hands could feel the heat on the upper surface, and the fans were spinning at the maximum speed. The fans were noisy too.  When I googled for solutions, many solutions seemed to suggest that I stop doing many of the activities I usually do, including watching YouTube videos, work etc... I sold it.,This new M1 MacBook Pro 2020 is not only fast and quiet, I have not felt a single reason to stop doing the things I want to do. I know the M1 is a little more expensive but is also more efficient.

Amanda Costa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I already had an HP laptop that had no problems other than the battery life was lacking. So, why did I get another one? I'm about to start nursing school at the end of August which requires you to have a laptop all day (about 8 hours). My dad surprised me this MacBook. I am an apple girl through and through (watch, phone, AirPods). To say that I was over the moon receiving my first MacBook was an understatement. I've been testing it out for about a week now. It came in perfect condition. No scratches or problems with the screen. This computer is FAST when it comes to everything. As soon as you open it, it is on. I seriously can't catch it off no matter how little I open it. Every web page pops up quick and loads quicker. I'm amazed that I can text through this MacBook and it synced all of my stuff from the cloud effortlessly. It has a Touch Bar that is insanely cool and in my opinion, useful. The battery life. OMG the battery life. I purposely did everything in my power to drain it. I am on day 7 of using it without charging it and it is at 41%. Now, I haven't been on it all day everyday. I have mainly used it to write, read, and text. However, I've used for a good 4 hours each day. If you're a college student who needs a reliable computer this one is for you!!!! It is 100% worth every penny. If you want coverage for the MacBook always go through apple. They will give you the best bang for your buck.

  I have a 2018 macbook pro. I use it for everything from adobe software to office.  I bought the M1 as it is supposed to be the fastest, and perhaps it is, but if I am just on the internet or using microsoft word to write a paper for school. It does not outdo the Intel in my previous laptop.  I put them next to one another to test the speed on chrome.  My entire life is on chrome, so switching to safari would be a pain.  I use it at work and personal.  It is ridiculously slow compared to my old macbook.  I took it back to the store and showed them, and they replaced my laptop thinking it was a hardware issue.  No, it is still the same.  After researching, apparently this is the case with the new M1 - it does not run chrome or microsoft office efficiently.  If you don't need these apps, then go for it, but if you do, you will find yourself frustrated that it takes so long to load a page just going through the internet.
"
Dan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've been using my M1 MBP for 4 months now with apps like Photoshop, Logic Pro, Chrome, Safari (all M1 compatible) and there are tons and tons of lag every time. Its the kind of lag that makes you think maybe I should've gotten more RAM but it doesn't seem to be memory issues. I love the battery life and not hearing the fan BUT I actually miss my 15in Intel mac. Don't upgrade yet, stick to your macbook and wait for the bugs to be worked out.

I use an external hard drive for photos and music cause  is a 256 and 8g. I have Microsoft office 2019 installed and its working like a charm.

JCAZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When I received my new Macbook Pro 13"" with M1 chip, the inside of the white Apple laptop box, the charging cable, and the actual Macbook laptop smelled strongly of mold., I was able to decrease the smell somewhat by repeatedly soaking the waterproof parts of the charging cable, but obviously there's no way to wash or soak the inside of the laptop.  Mold smell is still very noticeable around plastic vented areas at the back of the laptop, even after leaving the new Macbook out of the box for several days to air out. After researching problem in other forums, found that some other customers have had similar problems with new Apple charging cables, USB-C to USB-C cables,  and laptops/laptop packaging.  I never had this happen before, and definitely never expected this from Apple. Real bummer, especially for price paid. (Ordered direct from Apple online store, hoping that customer service might be easier.)

Hayden S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought a 13"" MacBook Pro 16GB, 1TB directly from Apple but I wanted to leave my thoughts here in case anyone is on the fence. It is worth it. The new M1 chip is able to keep up with my workflow without breaking a sweat when all the other PCs and Macs in my office have to ramp up their fans to try to keep up. Battery life for me lasts around 10 hours of hard work when my previous Mac would have died within 3 hours. This is truly a next-generation product.
"
cheryl stuart,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered this macbook pro with an 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 and my old Lenovo passed the speed of this computer 10 fold. I don't even know why I thought it was a good idea to purchase this garbage. It's like personal heating pad, and sounds like an airplane taking off. Tiny holes on the side of the keyboard does not cut it for cooling the pc. Not worth the buy at all.

  If you're like me and use multiple external monitors with your laptop, you should know that until Apple releases an update to their OS, you can only hook up ONE external monitor to this computer.,I ended up buying a 43"" monitor, so that I could have 1 external monitor do the job of (2) 27"" monitors.

  I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings.,Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life, but it's not far off. This isn't a huge deal for me, as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available, but for someone who needs the portability, the difference is substantial.,UPDATE 6/16/21: I have been using this laptop for over 6 months now on a daily basis. I have done everything from Word documents, email, web surfing, Logic Pro, Neural DSP guitar plugins, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Illustrator, and many other tasks and I do not think that I have even heard the fan come on 1 time. It's pretty astounding. The M1 is still exceedingly snappy and the battery life blows me away. And while more and more apps become native to M1, I'd expect performance to do nothing but improve.
"
"Michael Lacey, Devo Writers",5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's a solid Apple product, and I was WAY overdue to get a laptop. I researched and considered several pre-owned models, but the cost on this MacBook Pro and the M1 chip made it a clear choice. With used/refurbished computers, there are still risks, not to mention lower battery life and physical damage. With a brand new machine, those chances are almost completely gone!,I'm so glad I went with the new MacBook Pro. And if I decide to 'upgrade', I know this machine will hold its value in the used market.

  Upgraded from a 2015 Macbook Pro that has lasted me well more than 5 years in school. I expected the keyboard to be like the earlier gen macbooks; however, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were way more raised and offered a much better tactile feedback. In addition, the battery life will easily last a day of school. The only thing I don't like about this laptop is how the M1 Chip doesn't support VM and a few other apps; but that can be changed in the future.

  Nothing has changed, but the increase of price. The computer like most Apple products runs on the hot side, and after being fully charged it doesn't last very long. The new Ipad is worse when it comes to charging. I am an Apple user for all things so I knew what I was getting myself into. The lack of ports to connect other items to it is very disappointing. You have to spend more money on hubs. With the price being what it is at least give us back the usb, hdmi, and more thunberbolts standard.

"
Gabriel Paulo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excepcional! Para quem vem do Windows, terá um pouco de dificuldade no começo, afinal estamos falando de outro sistema operacional. O acabamento do produto é excelente e vale o valor cobrado por vendedores entre 9 a 10K, entretanto, pagar mais que isso nesse notebook, como por exemplo os 17K cobrados pela Apple no site oficial, não vale o produto. A mesma análise eu faria para comprar uma versão de 8gb ou 16gb, pagar o valor extra, que faz o notebook chegar a casa dos 15K (vendedores sem ser site oficial) deve ser pensado com muito cuidado e embasado em uma excelente justificativa, pois pra uso profissional o modelo de 8Gb tem sido mais que o suficiente, agora, se sua ideia for trabalhar com edições de vídeo para empresas, com material proveniente de câmeras de altíssimo nível, edição e criação de conteúdos em layers em softwares como After Effects (ainda falando de trabalhos extremamente profissionais, pois trabalhos mais comuns como meros mortais usam, a versão de 8gb também é suficiente), aí sim, vá no de 16gb se também precisar de portabilidade/locomoção. Contudo, se faça a seguinte pergunta: Se for para trabalhos gráficos pesados, por que não adquirir um Workstation?,Abraços e espero ter ajudado quem pretende comprar esse excelente produto.

  Recebi tudo certinho, só achei que a embalagem que foi enviado foi mal embalada, a caixa chegou com avarias (o produto estava intacto), veio amassada e rasgada, sei que nao tem nada a ver com o vendedor e sim com os correios, mas acho que o vendedor poderia ter embalado melhor, veio enrolada em uma camada de plastico bolha e só... e veio meio que solto dentro de caixa maior... entao quanto a embalagem precisa melhorar... mas o que interessa é o produto, chegou, tudo certinho! obrigado!

  O Macbook pro M1 é INCRÍVEL, é um computador pequeno, com uma capacidade e desempenho de gigante. Ele é caro? Sim, mas vale cada centavo, pq o bicho é ótimo!,A iiStore entregou muito antes do prazo, com nota fiscal na caixa e eu tinha pedido no chat e eles me mandaram, logo depois que enviaram o pedido para entrega. Foram atenciosos e responderam todos os meus chats, da um medinho pq ele esta num valor muito mais baixo, comparado com outras lojas, mas é original e todo perfeitinho.,A tomada veio padrão americano, mas se vc tiver aqueles benjamin ou tomadas antigas em casa, da pra usar normalmente.,Estou totalmente satisfeito, eu nunca usei um produto da Apple e realmente é tudo aquilo que escutamos por aí, é um produto premium!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  É exatamente o que você viu até agora. Vídeo, foto, podcast, se alguém falou sobre esse macbook falou bem, e muito bem. Então já vou aos pormenores de antemão:,1. Ele é pesado. Uma coisa feita com essa carcaça belíssima, esse corpo perfeito, espaçoso do jeito que é, mesmo cabendo em um envelope de 23x30cm, não tem jeito, vai ser pesado.,2. É pontudo! Hahahaha, se alguém já segurou um iphone12 sabe o desconforto que é apertar ele ou ficar muito tempo na mão sem capinha, isso é muito estranho, mas mesmo com os cantos arredondados se você pretende usar ele no seu colo, vai se incomodar com a carcaça de traços bem definidos.,3. Essa ventuinha está quebrada. Sim! Impressionante, só dá pra saber que a ventuinha dele está funcionando quando você passa o dedo no corpo dele e seu dedo treme levemente, ao invés de derrapar. Nunca vi isso em toda a minha vida, realmente, fiquei besta.,4. Vem com uma base de 225gb de memória livre, na versão com 256gb.,5. A bateria não vai acabar, não adianta. Ela não acaba mesmo não, fizeram alguma mágica aqui. Eu to a dois dias, cerca de 11h usando desde a última carga completa, já fiz de um tudo aqui, até testei mineirar bitcoin com um programa em python. Pois é, a bateria segue firme. Agora fazem 23h, to com ele ligado desde as 15:30 por aí, caiu de 63% pra 20%. Nada mais a declarar.,6. Essa tela é surreal, muito adaptativa, mesmo! Meus olhos agradecem.,7. Esquenta sim ok! Mas só quando eu instalei um monte de programa um atrás do outro. Fora isso, ficou normal, e ele esquenta apenas acima da tecla esc, até o meio da touch bar, em nenhum outro lugar além desse. (acho que o chip fica ali).,8. Acabou, acho que isso é tudo o que eu nunca vi ninguém falar nos vídeos. Se você está pensando em comprar ele, compre-o, pretendo ficar com essa máquina por 10 anos, e acho que ficarei, assim como fiquei 11 anos com meu mac mini.,p.s. Ao vendedor, VOCÊ É DEMAIS! ENVIOU EMBALADO EM 3 METROS DE PLASTICO BOLHA, EU TE AMO <3

  Comprei pela portabilidade, duração de bateria e velocidade. Estou muito satisfeito com a qualidade de construção, sistema operacional e a duração de bateria.,Sou desenvolvedor de software e comprei a versão de 8gb e as vezes para coisas que faço é pouco. O sistema começa a fazer swap e ficar menos responsivo. Gastei também quase R$500 em acessórios para funcionar com meu setup anterior, mas estava ciente.,Comprei por um preço justo e estou satisfeito.

Raissa A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Quanto ao computador não usei o suficiente pra encontrar algum ponto de atenção, atendeu minhas expectativas e necessidades. Vale o investimento, não faz dois anos comprei um laptop com excelente configuração e que mesmo assim não funciona. A apple não tem isso, tudo deles cumpre e dura, por isso, no final o produto se paga. Pesquisei muito qual computador comprar e o vendedor e fiz a melhor escolha possível, pelo equipamento e loja! Recebi o note impecável, super bem embalado, e muito antes da data prevista. Antes de enviar fui contatada pelo Rafael, da ByTech Info, ele me mandou foto da pacote, me senti bem assistida e segura. Recebi a NF junto, só tenho elogios e recomendações.
"
Matheus Campanhã,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Como desenvolvedor de sistemas, os principais pontos fortes são: performance (apesar de 8gb de ram, se comportou de forma flúida inclusive com simuladores mobile ativos), bateria (programando, com simuladores ligados, e brilho alto, consumiu aprox 40% após 5 horas de uso intenso... impressionante) e mobilidade (muito leve, fino e não esquenta muito, poucas vezes ligou a ventoinha). Ponto negativo: por enquanto ainda existem algumas incompatibilidades de tecnologias com a arquitetura arm64 do M1, mas em geral há workarounds para superá-los. De forma geral, uma excelente compra

Social science professor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Over the past 10 years, I've had five MacBook Airs and three MacBook Pros (my employer provides a new one for my work every few years, and I upgrade my own at home every 1-2 years).  Most recently, my personal computer has been an early 2020 intel quad core MacBook Pro and my work computer an early 2020 MacBook Air.  The brand new M1 MacBook Air is my favorite by far, and fixes everything I didn't like about the MacBook Air & Pro introduced in early 2020.,The M1 MB Air's battery life is amazing, I can use it all day and still have 50-60% battery remaining.  My previous MB Air and MB Pro gave me around 5-6 hours of battery life (despite Apple promising ~10 hours) - which was barely enough to get me through the day.,I'm also loving the the fanless design, silent operation, and increased performance.  Even though I don't do much video editing, my workflow can be taxing on the computer:  I regularly run lots of apps simultaneously, including Zoom for teaching, many open browser windows, Excel & statistical/database software, and a connected iPad I use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over Zoom.  The new M1 MacBook Air handles this easily, and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan.  The MB Pro I've used since April (the one introduced in early 2020 with Intel quad core processors) also handles this load well, but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes.  The early 2020 MacBook Air buckled under this load, it gets very hot and the fans are screaming.,Besides the better battery life, silent operation, and robust performance, the new M1 MB Air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous MB Airs.,The MB Air's display doesn't get as bright as the MB Pro's display - that has been true for years, but it has never been a problem for me.  I would only need the display to be brighter if I were working outside on a sunny day, and I just don't do that.,I really love the keyboard on the new M1 MacBook Air, which is the same as the keyboard on the early 2020 MB Air & Pro, and MUCH improved IMHO from the butterfly keyboards on the previous MB Airs & Pros.  It is quiet and super comfortable for typing.  When typing very fast, my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly-style keyboards.,This is subjective, but I really prefer the MB Air form factor - the wedge shape and slightly lower weight - compared to the MB Pro.  I also strongly dislike the MB Pro's Touch Bar.  I've had two different MB Pros with Touch Bars and they were nothing but trouble for me.  When typing fast, my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the Touch Bar, which would trigger a command (like launching the Music app), which would interrupt my workflow.  I know other people don't have that problem, and other people find the Touch Bar useful, but it's just not for me.,For me, the MB Air speakers (on this and on the previous model) are quite good for movies or YouTube videos or Zoom/Facetime calls.  The microphone is perfectly satisfactory, though for Zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos I usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better.,The webcam is still disappointing, even though image quality is SLIGHTLY improved over previous MacBooks.,The external design is exactly the same as MacBook Airs from years past.  I like the design pretty well, but Apple will redesign the MB Air & Pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer.  I will want one of those and might regret that I didn't wait.,But for now, the M1 MacBook Air is the best MacBook I've ever had, it fixes everything that I didn't like about previous MacBooks (except the webcam) and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way.

J. Hansen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  (Heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but I wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).,The MacBook Air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. One caveat that has always plagued the MacBook Air of year’s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the “Pro” line). That was why I always got a MacBook Pro in year’s past. This time around, when Apple announced the new M1 chip, I was curious, so I watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new Air (the Air has the same chipset as the MacBook Pro, with the same GHz at 3.2, while saving $300). I am on a budget, but I also didn’t want to sacrifice performance, so I was a little nervous I was missing out by not getting the Pro, but thankfully I have not had to sacrifice a thing.,I am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign, etc. I previously purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-March when I made a grievous error and went out and purchased a Lenovo Yoga C940 with 16GB of Ram, Intel i7 Processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. Buyer’s remorse soon followed as the Yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. The only thing that I liked was the speaker set-up and the 4K touch screen. Other than that, I was beyond disappointed. I sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 MacBook Pro, until I purchased this Air.,So the pro’s:,Fantastic battery life—I have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. It will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you aren’t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like I do. It’s great to know you don’t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and it’ll still have battery to spare). A win in my book.,Heat management and fanless design—I am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why I always love the MacBooks and detest Windows (hence sending the Lenovo back).  The fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. I don’t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. I also like that I don’t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. I can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry I’m blocking a fan exhaust.  Again, another win in my book.,Slim design—at 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you’re lugging around a brick. I also liked the tapered design as it’s a little more ergonomic than my MacBook Pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. It’s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.,Keyboard—gone are the butterfly mechanisms of MacBook’s past. One thing I really missed when I gave up my 2015 MacBook Pro was the keyboard! Thankfully with the new Air and Pro’s, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers don’t feel like they’re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.,Trackpad—I love, love the force touch trackpad. I still believe Apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. Hands down. It’s smooth as butter.,Performance—This is the little machine that could. It puts my 2017 Pro to shame. It also outperforms the Lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. I can have multiple tabs in Safari open, Photoshop, Apple Music, Microsoft Word, and this doesn’t even break a sweat. I also like that I can do some light video editing on this. For most people—especially college students—this computer’s power should be more than sufficient. Keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the Pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. Again, that’s if you’re editing like multiple 4K videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average Joe that may only need to do the occasional video project—no problem! This computer can handle it!,Screen—It’s nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like I do.,Speakers—I am a music junkie, and I have to constantly have music going when I’m working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. Good stereo separation and punchy. They could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but that’s to be expected for such small speaker drivers. I am more than pleased with them. They also work good for binge-watching shows on Netflix.,The cons (there are few):,The webcam—it’s a 720P webcam, and well, it looks like a 720P webcam. It’s a little grainy and washed out. It will do in a pinch, but you’d think in 2020 we’d get an upgrade on the webcam.,The lack of ports—in true Apple fashion, the I/O is somewhat lacking. You have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external GPU, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that Apple’s M1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which I am sure will be resolved in future iterations). I would have liked to have seen at least one USB-A port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. But that’s just me being nit-picky.,M1 chip running Intel apps—because Apple’s M1 chip runs on ARM and most apps are coded for Intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new Apple chip natively (like Adobe Creative Cloud). You might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. So far, I haven’t really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. I am sure here soon it won’t be a problem. Again, it’s nit-picking.,--,To sum up: this MacBook Air is a winner. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and I would absolutely buy it again. You get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the Pro line. I am very happy with this computer and think I might just have come as close as I can to the perfect laptop for my needs.,Happy shopping!

Chris D.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This was the first Apple Laptop I've purchased. My entire life I was so excited to always purchase an Apple MacBook/MacBook Air because of the positive reviews. I tend to review most everything in the most positive light, but this is just horrible. I constantly come back to the laptop and it says ""Please report unexpected shutdown to Apple."" This has happened at least 8 times with no response from an Apple Technician. Then the camera quality for a 2020 Machine is something out of the 1990s. It's horrible, I look grainy and I bought this laptop for an MBA program. If you want to run many programs at once, even with upgrade RAM and Processor, you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off CONSTANTLY. The. fan. does. not. shut. off. Sure it's portable, sure the ""build"" quality feels good in the hand. In terms of performance, spend the extra money and don't get this. I'm quite embarrassed I shelled out over $1k for this. Do as you wish, but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an Apple Laptop again.

  I have both an iPad and iPhone so I thought is would be make sense to have a Mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were.  To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7.  The Mac Air's battery life is much less than advertised.  The claim is around 10 hours, I doubt I get 5, and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff.  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom.  The battery life of the Surface is better.  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC, but the differences are minor and manageable.  But documents open more slowly on the Mac, and mine has the M1 chip.  On the Surface, documents usually open immediately.  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac.  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it.  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Mac's native software.  So I downloaded VLC.  It works fine on the Mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store, including Firefox.  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either.  On the other hand, the Mac has a better screen than the Surface.  While the Surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and I almost never use it as a tablet.  When I am not sitting at a desk, I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface.  The new Mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the Surface.  So a mixed bag.  As I mentioned, I like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac.  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but don't know if I want to spend the extra money.

s,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love Linux, i can tolerate windows, usually don't like Mac. It's fine folks like what they like for me, Linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  Mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain.,well here we are in 2021. I mainly work on linux these days, and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office, i need that. i am not doing windows development these days. I know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows. not with mac --  for my use case, so i tried it... gave it another shot really. My timing was seemingly really good., these computer are fantastic. You know what i hate about laptops. when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on. I hate that i really do. All of my laptops do this. The mac M1 I am pleased to report doesn't. Screw performance i mean that's great here, but the quiet and note heat that's the feature.,This is coming from someone that doesn't want to like Apple. They outsource all these jobs, their stuff is over priced right? I'm not so  sure about the price here. You can buy a mac pro 13 inch that's faster than an i9 for 1500 (if you get 16gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it's not a lenovo, but other than that it's about as good as you can get. This machine is so well thought out. I got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. Don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine IN ADDITION to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. I digress. The only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. It needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.,All these reviews are usually full of crap. It's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. This time it's true. This architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. I 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. I don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use I'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. What a great product. It really really is. This i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. After 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with TPM chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. I like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.,This thing is really just that good. I've been i this industry for a long time. There are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if Apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. I have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. I'd imagine there will be a strong response fro Intel, amd and the software companies.  It's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. I mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. That's all most people are going to need. Who cares if they release better ones in 6 months. they always do they'll probably cost too much. this is all you need.

  okay so, pretty great laptop. it doesn’t overheat, the camera is better than my previous macbook, and it runs pretty well. the only problem i have is that extensions like chrome keep crashing. as a student using google meet and zoom for 7 hours a day i really can’t be crashing in the middle of a class. i’m not big on tech, so i’m not that picky, but i hope this problem sorts itself out.

  Brought this from apple directly,Display started showing Vertical stripes within 20 days of purchase,And yes not in stock for replacement,Apple was helpful in refunding the money,I would recommend to go for 512 GM ssd,256 GB only gives you to 140 Gb odd space to work with

  Why doesn't the warranty option appear anywhere on the page rendering the new MacBook Air (M1) - even if I put it in my cart... there's no checkbox rendering for Apple's warranty?

Jonathan Borgia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What happens when you perfect a product? You can only go downhill. In 2015 Apple perfected the MacBook. Then, they ruined it.,Everyone in 2015: It's great. A bit more battery life would be nice.,Apple: We'll make it thinner, make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms, remove the magnetic break-a-way power cable that everyone loves, replace all the ports with USB-C ports so people have to buy dongles, swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions, and hell (just to mess with everyone) let's lower the battery life.,The 2020 does little to fix any of the issues. It's a crap product, but after Jobs died Tim Cook couldn't make changes because he'd basically be admitting he was wrong. And they need to keep changing things because otherwise it is only perfect and not ""new"" - Whoever decided this was the way to go should be working in an Amazon warehouse sorting returns.

  Before I begin, I’d like to clarify that I purchased this MacBook on Apple.com.,I was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a MacBook due to the expensive pricing. But it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality. I’ve had. Chromebook for 3 years, and the quality is not amazing. I’ve had to bring it for repair multiple times. It also shut down randomly. But not with this MacBook.,The MacBook is soo beautiful, and sleek. The rose gold color is so elegant, and the keys are amazing. At the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables Touch ID which is so convenient and easy to work.,By just saying “hey, Siri” my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever I need. It comes with so many apps. And so many ways to customize your MacBook.,I changed my profile photo, set a quote on my Lock Screen, changed my wallpapers, made widgets, changed my highlight color, accent colors and much much more.,It’s so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the “pages” app open in another so I can take notes while my teachers gives lessons.,As shown in the pictures, if you update your MacBook with Big Sur, you can download “Widgetsmith” and customize widgets! My entire MacBook’s aesthetic is so elegant and I just love it. Comparing this to laptops like HP and Dell, as well as Google, there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your liking.,I asked a couple of friends and family members who have MacBooks, and they have had them for 5+ years, without having to take their MacBooks for repair. I am hoping this will be my case as well.,I can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail app.,The camera quality is great too! It’s touched up my appearance with zoom and Google meet. and I’ve heard if you want a MacBook to edit, the pro is the way to go because the storage is bigger.,The battery life is so great too! I’ve used it for 6+ hours starting at 9am to 4:30 pm. It started at 45 percent and it only went down to 30!!!,Buying a MacBook will not water your money! I am loving every second of my use!!! Thank you Apple!!! 💜

  Just bought the new M1 and through a series of events and customer support prompts: I started out with 2 computer's and can now barely use my old one because it's too old to support macOS Catalina  (mac pro late 2012)...super unhappy, not because the support wasn't excellent, because it was. Rather because I was sent a computer that didn't know how to migrate data from one mac to the next, which is fully unacceptable. Every prompt to fix this issue adds more time I've had to invest in this problem and ultimately makes things worse. I've been at fixing this issue since Tuesday. It would be fine if the process hadn't bricked my old computer where, once I was running logic, can now barely open a pdf. I've been thinking of moving out of the mac eco system for some time now and this will certainly push me on my way out of it. I've not had the new M1 computer for a week and haven't even seen the home screen yet. Every one says how awesome the M1 is, hopefully some day i'll know.

  Don't let the fanboys sway you, you're a beta tester with this laptop.  Lots of software doesn't function with it, I know, it didn't run of key programs I needed, also what does can be buggy at times.  If you're using this for work or real money is counting on its use DO NOT buy, simple as that.  Lots of things should have been better, the bezel in 2021 is thick.  The lack of ports is ridiculous.  If you planned to use windows, count that out.  If your a grandma using it to surf the web go for it.

  Yup.  This M1 MacBook Air is everything the online reviewers said it was--amazingly fast, agile, and smart.  It blows away all earlier MacBook Airs as well as most other laptops on the market.  I'm not much of a tech nerd, so the specs and numbers don't mean much to me.  I'm a writer.  So I appreciate the feel, ease, and portability of the machine.  Plus, I'm delighted with the keyboard--heads and tails better than the faulty ""butterfly"" keyboard on my old 2017 Air.  All in all, this is a great small laptop.  Solid, but light.  Lightning fast and nimble.  It is a great step up from the older Intel machines.  And I'm not in the least bothered that the external design is the same as the older models.  It's a classic and fully functional shape, so why change?  Well done, Apple.

  I was hesitant to get a smaller Macbook after my 15"" 2015 Macbook Pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  I repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.,Anyhow, I couldn't resist the idea of an ARM based Macbook, so I went with the 2020 13"" Macbook Air since I don't think the Pro model had Apple Silicon yet.  I could be wrong on that.,Long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  It turns out that I'm perfectly comfortable with a 13"" screen and that I don't need a bigger one.,Everything great about this Macbook:,- It's *fast*!  Don't let the ""Air"" moniker deceive you.  Unless you're into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  ARM processors are the future of consumer computing.,- The battery life is *insane*.  I still can't comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  I take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that I will run out of power, even when I'm charging my phone off it!,- It's slim and light!  Perfect for traveling.,- It is completely solid state with no moving parts!  No fan whirring or anything like that.,- As an extension of the first point, it runs ARM builds of Windows insanely well with Parallels.  It can even run Halo: CE at near full speed!,- macOS is very stable.,- The retina screen is nice.,- Despite what people are saying about the camera, it's actually better than the one on my old Macbook Pro.  (this isn't to say that the camera is *good*, but it's adequate IMO),- All things considered, the M1 Macbook Air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.,- It has a larger touchpad than my old Macbook Pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13"" Macbook Pros.  I find this preferable because it is just the right size where I'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as I type.  If you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.,- No touchbar!!!  Halleluja!!!!,- Decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.,There are some cons, but they are pretty minor IMO:,- Only the left side has USB-C ports, in contrast to the Pro which has them on both sides.  The right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that's useful to you.  However, I've managed fine without USB on the right side.,- It would be nice if I didn't have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  On pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.,- If you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (I however consider this a good thing),- Although the speakers have improved in quality since previous Air models, the Pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  You may feel like you've gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a Pro model.  Personally, I've gotten used to it plus I use AirPods most of the time anyway.,- The Air does NOT have an HDMI port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide HDMI.,- Storage capacity is workable but limited.  Would be nice to get at least 1 TB of storage in the future.  In the meantime I just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.,I'm a software engineer and the M1 Macbook Air exceeds my needs and expectations.  I think I'll just be buying the Air model in the future because it's terrific value for the price point.  $999 might be expensive for some, but I can assure you that it's a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  I've owned many non-Apple laptops in the past and I ended up hating all of them.  On the other hand, I never regret owning an Apple device.  This is coming from someone who formerly used Windows and Linux.  I got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  Apple isn't perfect... my last Macbook Pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops I owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how I treated them.

  Yes there are bezels but honestly who cares?  This package delivers an extremely strong value as someone who spends most of their time in a browser, working on excel and word.  Chrome has not posed any issues so far with many extensions and two profiles running simultaneously as of the time of writing mid december.  8gb of ram is more than enough to run a multitude of apps thanks to apple's strong os optimization.,This one is a keeper, I've been trying out macbooks for awhile and was always unhappy with something. Don't get me started with the battery life, it is so good that I spend most of my time off the charger.,Most average joes looking for a daily driver or work from home computer will be satisfied with this.  As long as apple continues to support the first gen of desktop silicon for a long time like everything else, then I have no doubt this will last for a long time.

  Full disclosure, bought from Best Buy open box for a much better price and convenient same day pick up.,Shouldn't surprise anyone, build quality is top of the line, feels ultra premium, track pad, screen and keyboard are perfect. Screen is actually amazing, makes a huge different coming from even an IPS windows laptop. Fanless is truly fantastic, laptop stays cool with demanding tasks while sipping battery. I sat there for 5 hours doing some serious writing and safari browsing, and barely lost ~20%. I'd imagine you could get a couple days with casual/moderate use.,This laptop solves all the problems of the previous Air's, it doesn't get super hot and the fans kick on obnoxiously loud. Performance is top notch, and the only real downfall is the lack luster webcam, but I'm not knocking off a star because every laptop has at least one compromise. This is a compelling package for the price, especially if you get more than 3 years out of it which is very doable. Overall was very impressed with this machine coming from a Ryzen 3500u Windows laptop.

  Don't be fulled by 13"" description. Its bigger! And much heavier! New Air completely lost its purpose to be small and light laptop that is convenient on the go. If I wanted a bigger and more capable laptop I would have bought a PRO not an AIR. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a normal size AIR

  Apple USED to make great computers... Past tense! I've used them for many (almost 20) years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed. How the mighty have fallen!,I was always the biggest Apple supporter. I have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself. From the Apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros, macbook airs and phones. I defended them against the Apple haters and always had their backs. I thought I was going to be Apple for life. I even own many shares of their stock, which I will be dumping soon because I see the writing on the wall. I could tell something was up with them as Apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn't move. It's the biggest slug of a stock. I now think I have stumbled upon the reason why.,If you google the recent complaints about Apple you will see. Apple does not have the great customer service they once had. I was mistaken to think they did. They have also started cheaping out... big time. The result? Products that don't last. Couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and I'm sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here... Selling all of my $AAPL stock ASAP stat.,Warning, do not buy this computer! Apple's quality has gone wayyy downhill.,The MacBook Air cords are absolutely horrendous! I am on my third Apple cord in less than 6 months. I brought the product to an Apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me. He told me I must be doing something wrong. Nothing has changed about my usage of their products. I've always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old. Think years and years. Not months. So you'd think if I was the problem like this guy tried to say I was, I'd be going through computer cords right and left, right? Well I haven't. And looking up my account would prove that. However, Apple doesn't care. They want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway.,Welcome to the new Apple where the customer is always WRONG.,Then the guy doubled down and told me that he'd been working at the Apple store for 10 years and I'm the ONLY person who has ever had a problem with their cord. A simple google search has proved that to be completely false. Everybody complains about the quality of their cords. This must be huge business for them selling cords like this.,So the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong. If you want to sign on for that, good luck. I hope you never run into a problem and see what I'm talking about but you'll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time. I am DONE! I work too hard for my money and they aren't the only computer show on the road. Lucky for me I speak PC too.,Thanks for nothing Apple! Good job burning that bridge. You just lost a loyal customer over $19. Hope it was worth the extra $$$$. It's not the money Apple. It's the principle. I won't do business with companies who treat me like that, period. Peace out!

  My favorite thing about this new macbook is the ability to listen to music beautifully at the first level of volume. At max volume a theater can hear it.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Through the past year and a half, students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks, most importantly being school. From my personal experience I believe that the MacBook Air 2020 is the best tool for the job. If you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future, the MacBook Air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility that it uses.,First, the MacBook Air 2020 is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged. In my school days I did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer. Now I do not have to do that at all because I only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its 30 hour charge. Next, the apple compatibility that it uses, including Apple music, iMessage, Facetime, etc., makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text. This apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so. Finally, is the processing speed and storage. The MacBook Air 2020 has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer. This makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life. Although it is expensive, the MacBook Air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the MacBooks, including computers such as the MacBook Pro. The strange thing that the MacBook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel. The storage that is available with the MacBook is 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB, but most went with 512GB. These large amounts of storage are fantastic, showing that one of the MacBook Air's biggest competitors(Dell XPS 13) only lets you choose between 128GB and 256GB. Now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just won't cut it. For these reasons the MacBook Air 2020 is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility.,Overall, the MackBook Air has the processing speed, storage capacity, battery life, and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer. Throughout the last year and a half, I have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things. Getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker, but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience.

  I've had mine less than 3 months and am unhappy and peeved off. While this is a pretty and nice laptop as well as light and easy to travel with. It LAGS and is SLOW. Every time I haven't opened my laptop an hour after I last opened it nothing happens with the screen and I am forced to hold the power button until it turns off and then on again, if I'm lucky it works the first time. and when you plug anything into it the computer FREEZES! (you also need to get an adapter because it doesn't take USB) Apple is once again charging way too much for a subpar product. If you're looking for fast and streamlined this is NOT the computer for you. Very disappointed and utterly annoyed.

Joshua Oh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When I was in college, I used both mac and PC and after I graduated I switched exclusively to PC because of the versatility (gaming and upgradability). When I decided to go back to grad school, I decided to give Apple another chance with this laptop because I heard great things and high expectation with the new m1 chip design. I was not disappointed.,This new CPU has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use (browsing the web, watching videos, reading, studying, etc. ). I can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it. Also, it's so compact and thin that it's easy to take everywhere! compared to my old macbook from 2012, it is incredibly light. I always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops, but this definitely is easy to carry around.,As someone who used a desktop, the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to. The keys don't have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has, but considering the size of the laptop, it is expected. I can see it being an issue with its small screen. Although it is convenient for me, the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight. Lastly, the price is steep for a laptop. A PC variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where Apple normally lacks, but I have yet to try the Apple Arcade on my macbook air. It is also only USB-C which is a turn-off to many, but with a dongle, it is not a problem for me.,I would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with, this is an easy grab. Make sure you buy a dongle along side of it.,TL;DR,Pros:,- battery life,- m1 chip,- size (easy to carry around),- weight,Cons:,- keyboard,- size (screen is a bit small for some),- price,- only USB-C

  I was using a 2015 MacBook Pro for doing video editing for my church, and when I saw the specs on the M1 based MacBook Pro, I upgraded for faster processing.  My existing system has an Apple monitor, wi-fi keyboard and mouse, and a WD 3 TB external drive.,The two USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro are inadequate!  I also bought a new 27"" LG monitor because I couldn't figure out how to use the old monitor with the new computer.  The LG monitor has 4 USB-C ports on the back, so I assumed would give me enough connections for my devices.  WRONG!!!!!,Only one of the LG ports is Lighting compatible, so I had to use it to connect and power the laptop.  I had to buy a USB-C to Displayport adapter, plus a Displayport to Firewire adapter to connect my external drive, but this wasn't supported over the monitor's USB-C ports, it had to be connected to the remaining Lightening port on the laptop.  This consumed all the easily accessible ports!,Then I had to buy a USB-C to USB3 adapter to connect my camera and other devices to the computer.  All behind the monitor.  It's a royal pain!  I've got it working, but I'm unhappy with the cludge.  I don't understand why Apple put together such a capable laptop with so limited connection capabilities.  I'm going to be d*****g with this terrible configuration for years.,On the positive side, their claims of faster processing are true.  I can put together a church video, then export it to a file in 1/2 the time as my old laptop.  Even the upload speeds to YouTube seem to be faster.

  Here’s my in-depth review of the M1 MacBook Air. (Don’t get confused by the color Amazon said on top, it’s a gold color, and bought it off Best Buy).,Processor,This thing has a blazing-fast M1 system on a chip @3.2 GHz. The bootup times are so short and apps launch instantly. Also apps are incredibly smooth.,Display,This has a Retina display. It’s the best laptop display. YouTube videos come to life. If you zoom in on this Mac’s screen the pixels are “so small and so close together, that the human eye can’t even distinguish them, so type looks razor sharp”. That’s the moral of the iPad 3rd Gen, guys!,Audio and Microphone,In short terms, the audio and microphone audio are both REALLY clear. I’m pretty sure these are stereo speakers.,Description,Overall the best notebook we ever had. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.

  It amazes me how much praise Apple seems to be getting for an out dated design and user interface.  Where is the touch interface and pen input especially since it is supposed to run IPad apps?  Where is the flexibility of a 2 in 1 that we have had available for years?  Apple has basically given us a fast dinosaur with a pretty face.

EVPlab,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I absolutely love my new MacBook.  When it arrived I answered a few questions, connected it to my WiFi and off I went.  It has been a buttery smooth experience.  Keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it's the best feeling keyboard I have ever owned.  Many professional reviewers agree it's terrific. The multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done.  For example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button.  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value.  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store. It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have.  I still can't get used to how fast it works, it took me an hour to render a video on my old Mac but this MacBook did it in just a few minutes.  And it's cool and quiet! I'm using a huge 70"" 4K monitor as my secondary monitor.  Battery life is ridiculous.  I plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload, which is several hours per day.  I think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size.  I join one Zoom conference per week, so it doesn't really matter. The one thing I hope gets updated with the next release are the ports.  I'm using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports. I recommend this notebook to all my friends and family.

  I have had this MacBook Air in the gold color for a few months now. This is actually my very first MacBook. I absolutely LOVE it. First of all, it is gorgeous. I am a sucker for cute packaging or a cute product, and this laptop is just stunning. I have never seen a beautiful laptop until I got this.,The performance is amazing as well. Super long battery life; I rarely have to charge it. Super thin. Never gets hot. Super fast. The 4k performance is beautiful. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Definitely worth the price.  I looked at all of the MacBooks in person before buying, and the Air is just stunning with its thin design. Did not like the looks of the Pro models!

  If you purchase the MacBook Air with the M1 chip YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RUN WINDOWS ALONG WITH MAC OS!  If your buying specifically to just use the Mac OS & don’t have a problem not being able to run Windows or any program that runs on Windows, then this system is a good Apple product.  If you are like myself (or want the option like you SHOULD JUST HAVE as has always been offered in the past with processors before the M1 and run Windows on a partitioned drive either with MAC OS, or boot up into Windows instead, the M1 chip now takes that ability to do so away!  The MacBook Air itself with the M1 chip now that they’ve finally incorporated the ability to run iPhone apps on it is in itself a huge breakthrough.  That was overall my biggest frustration with using MacBooks by a long shot.  And it seems they’ve fixed that now, so on one end impressive if your simply not needing Windows or anything that runs in the Windows environment of course.

  Bad Apple! Battery always drop dead without any reason. Sometimes, it is still 90% of battery, but it dropped dead in the middle of nowhere, or freeze, the screen just freezes 10 times a day at least. I have to force it to power off and on 10 times a day at least. I only have the Mac Air for 3+ Years, totally a junk!

  Granted I'm coming off a MBP 8/500 dual-core i5, but this thing is read-my-mind fast.  I keep quitting apps out of habit when you just don't need to.  Keyboard is back to pre-butterfly goodness, sound is great, and with a dock like the Anker 7-in-1 you will not mind the port count.  GarageBand and iMovie never miss a beat.  On geekbench, these new M1 units are surpassed only by the xeon Mac & iMac Pros and the 8-core i9 iMac.  Same no-go apps as Catalina, so no real surprises.  Can't wait for more universal binary apps, it'll only get better.

  Overall, I love it. However, with that said there are some serious cons to consider before purchasing.,1. Terrible camera--super grainy. This is unfortunate for a time that the majority of us are working at home or are reliant on FT for communication.,2. It's important to be mindful, and as most techs will admit, this is easily apple's worst M chip--it will only get better! In the meantime, however, this Mac is super fast!,I use it for school, work, and casual browsing. If that's what you're looking for, I recommend it. If you're looking for the best of the best, wait until they fix this camera.

Real person !,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First off I’m giving this one star just so you’ll read this honest review. I brought this Mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but I’m giving 1 star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers. The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market. I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read. Kept saying I need a usb3.0 to work. So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately. I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it. The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people. But for me it was not. Apple already doesn’t give us headphones anymore and they don’t even have the decency to give us a very good cable. 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one. Last apple laptop I will ever buy. O and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it.

  Like thousands of other people, the screen started flickering after about 2 months. Then it went completly black. Apple store said my only option was pay over $400 to fix the screen. Apple call center said they can only take a complaint and my only option is to pay the money the store said to fix their defective product. Google to find out more. Don't by this defective product, Apple says it is not covered by its warranty because it is the customer fault. But, it is happening to 1000s of people and they know it is actually their fault.

AC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I encourage people who have had a bad taste left in their mouth by older (Intel) MacBooks, like myself, at least try out an M1 machine in person and see the difference.,Compared to my older Core i5 MacBook: no more ridiculous heat and fan noise, no hit on performance with a bunch of apps open, and I could continue this list but *oh my god the battery.* I will watch a few YouTube videos, listen to music, edit some documents then check the battery percentage... to see it has gone down at most a handful of %, on pretty high brightness. It's a remarkable accomplishment that will surely change the way I use and transport my laptop. App compatibility has not been an issue for me at all, but it's worth I do not use any niche developer / engineering tools.

Can't install iOS ?,I am sort of the IT guy for my department in a company that was supposed to be hiring geniuses very capable, of at least keeping their computers running.,For my experience at work and elsewhere, I would rather trust Apple and any computer manufacturer over the words of these reviewers.,Seriously, a lot of people, are extremely capable of destroying a perfectly good computer in the first hour they put their hands on it.,Reinstalling iOS ? Soon after they just received the computer? If they broke it right out of the box, can they actually install an OS ?

  I traded in my previous MacBook Air for the current version with the M1 chip. I have only had it for four days and all I can say is wow! I didn't think I would notice much of a difference, but I am very impressed with the speed and the battery life of this new edition. I mainly use my laptop for emailing, paying bills, and web browsing, and I purchased this model instead of the Pro because I don't edit or shoot videos. This model is perfect for my needs.

  I'm a big techie and after seeing all the benchmarks had to get the M1. It's truly a game changing processor. My wife and I love this laptop. There's a slight adjustment as I'm a lifelong Windows user but MacOS is intuitive enough that it's not too bad. I tried to make the switch with Safari but it lacks profiles so I'm on the Brave browser. Brave works great and have had no issues so far. I also use signal and Bitwarden and both work fine.,Apple really knocked the ball out of the park with this machine. The one true con is the crappy webcam. Aside from that this is the best laptop money can buy on the market hands down.

It was good 13 years ago.,On the plus side, you can now stop using Windows entirely thanks to ARM, as intended, and thus all your productivity will stop as well unless you literally cannot stand using a regular portable computer, which has been a running joke since Seinfeld was on air.,Yes, this magical 8 core 2.7 Gigahertz processor with 8 gigs of ram, a 2700 mb/s read and write speed hard disk, and a 1.2 teraflop graphics card still struggles to keep up to my aging 8 year old Lenovo laptop upgraded with an SSD running windows 7 through 10+.,No, don’t bother having more than 2 applications open. It’s sucked for over a decade now unless you have the luck of owning a $2,000 iMac, or a $50 older iMac.,Seriously, don’t buy this. Computers have gotten worse in the last 10 years.,Handoff is still nice though.

  I got this MacBook Air for work, because my personal laptop is a 2019 Razer Blade, and while thin, it’s heavy and runs hot…like gaming laptops do.,I decided to get a MacBook Air M1 256g for a work laptop, and had no real expectations for it. I’ve been very impressed.,The quality is what you’d expect from Apple, sturdy construction, I love the keyboard, the display is solid and shows a depth that my other laptops never have. It has handled everything I’ve thrown at it, zooms, huge files of client contracts, browsing of course, I haven’t ever noticed it throttling due to a lack of a fan.,It’s operating system is very user friendly too, some tasks that are a bit more difficult in a PC are astonishingly easy., Honestly, I haven’t even touched the Razer Blade in a few months, I will always have an apple laptop from here on out.

  Upgraded from Mid 2015 base Macbook Air. This thing is like 100x faster. It is amazing. I got used to the USB-C and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue. Actually like it better since USB C is faster. Battery life on my old MacBook was amazing. This one is literally at least double that. Pro tip do not use chrome on any Mac or MacBook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery (took me a while to learn this). Webcam is only bad part but all Macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iPhones. I got the base model and do NOT regret it one bet- I saved a ton of money on one less core and I do NOT notice a difference (heard its 10% or less). This thing is razor thin!

  GRAINY UNUSABLE CAMERA. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP. OR ANY LATEST 2020 MODEL - APPLE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE. WHAT A DISGRACE FOR A COMPANY LIKE APPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE FLAW.

  Do not buy refurbished/ used laptops from Amazon. Often times they are stolen and when you need software upgraded or fixed the manufacturer will not touch the computer when they figure out its stolen. Amazon will not refund or replace the computer with one that is not stolen. So you are stuck with stolen goods that can not be repaired through the manufacturer

  The MacBook Air is a great purchase for a laptop. It has many new features that will be helpful for school and work. The laptop is affordable, portable, and has the new M1 chip. The way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once. You will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features. It is also portable because it is light weight and slim. This will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college, since you will be carrying from class to class. Lastly, it has a new M1 processing chip. This M1 chip makes it better than any past MacBooks, it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast, it also gives you long battery life. I really do recommend you purchase the MacBook Air, it is worth buying.

  The 2020 MacBook Air BigSur OS is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of Apple’s best designs. Apple has had many MacBook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but The BigSur OS has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. This MacBook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now., For a student and any other user, upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer. This MacBook’s upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also. It has an Apple M1 Chip with an eight-core CPU which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations. This M1 Chip is designed by Apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. This BigSur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts Apple as the highest revenue electronic company., Battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. Many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. All day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. This MacBook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. These batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. These are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment., Good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. This MacBook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. This MacBook has eight GB of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. Having enough memory and storage is great. For example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. If there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. A lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur. Good memory and storage are important to many people and that's what makes the BigSur OS the best computer on the market., The MacBook BigSur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with. This model is an amazing choice for students, teachers, gamers, engineers, IT workers, and anyone who uses their computer a lot. The MacBook BigSur OS definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck.

  Theres a serious glitch where you can't use touch ID if drained from dead battery. Then it will ask you for a password. Unclear if this is an apple ID password or whatever, but mine didn't work. Tried every combo I knew. And then there is no option for reset password. Just none at all. And then it won't enter recovery mode. Just a horrible product, stay far away

  Macbook Review, Apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business, and the Mac is no exception. I have had different laptops before highschool, like Chromebooks, so I knew what I liked and did not like. After about two months of searching, I landed on the Macbook.  When researching which laptop to buy for highschool, I landed upon the Macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the Macbook, like touch I.D. and Siri., The modern aspects of the Macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. The first one is fingerprint recognition. When I had old laptops, I always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. Now, however, Apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which I find extremely useful. Between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. Now, though, all I need is my fingerprint and I can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. Also, the Macbook comes with Siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the Mac. There are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. But, Siri makes it easier. To activate Siri, all you have to do is simply say “Hey, Siri” and the assistant will appear. Siri responds to what is said, so if I say, “Hey Siri, find ‘Review 2’ from Google Drive,” the document will appear seconds later. Although the modern technologies of the Macbook are important, just as important is the software., Many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to Apple’s Macbook. First, the Mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. Safari is the Mac’s main browser, so what happens if for some reason I need to use Google Chrome? Well, the Mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, Google Chrome, Safari, and Bing. Also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. Most laptops are meant for business or school, like the Macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the Mac for games. Sometimes, after school, I explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. I expected the Macbook to do somewhat poorly, but I thought that it actually did pretty well. Another reason why the Macbook is great is because of the battery., The batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. The Macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a Chromebook. When I first used my Macbook, I used it without charging it until it needed it. How long did it last after starting at 50%? Almost one day with no charge. The Chromebook I had when I was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. Also, the battery uses an optimizing system. When the battery is below 30%, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. This helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. Not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop I have had., The Macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. From the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the Macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do. The Mac will change not only how to get things done, but your view of a laptop forever.

DONALD H. CLAFLIN,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip is overall amazing! It’s definitely worth the money! The all-new chipset has turned the Air lineup into a beast! My only complaint is the camera. Apple has stuck to the same 720p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better? I’m not convinced it’s any better, and it’s really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class. Also, the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard. It’s adjustable from the settings and easily accessible… but it’s just an inconvenience. It’s a petty complaint but for the money, this should be standard (it previously was on older models). Aside from that, this notebook is amazing! Lightning fast and the best battery life I’ve ever seen! Overall, if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and you’re looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life - this is the one for you!

  This is one of the most expesive laptops and have not Microsoft pack.  Pages &numbers, is horrible to work in it.,You need to buy the New Microsoft pack becasue it does not includying it and worse do not let dowlond due the M1 card, I do not find nothing good different neither in the camera with this new macbook air 2020.  At the least my last macbook air had inclided the Microsoft pack and was more easy to work.  The screen is not different neither with my old macbook, so I am vert disssapoinment, I bougth in January 2021 directly from the Apple website.

Core Well-Being,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Buyer beware! Like the MacBook Pro pictured here, the screen of the MacBook Air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase, entirely without any misuse. The design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screen's LCD panel.,I ordered a MBA, then returned the package unopened after reading relevant articles on 9to5mac and the discussion thread on the Apple support site. With few exceptions, Apple refuses to make the repair under warranty. The user's cost of replacing the screen amounts to half the purchase price.
"
HolyDiver,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Junk.  For $1000, I'm gonna need a little more than a 256GB ssd that can't ever be upgraded or replaced because it's soldered to the MB.  When the SSD goes, the whole thing is worthless.  Or inversely, if the MB dies, you can't remove the drive to get your data.  It's like they are trying to fill up landfills with garbage on purpose.
"
Epsilon Delta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This MacBook Air, I think Steve Jobs would have a smile on his face if he sees it.  So fast, so light, the battery can seem to last forever.  You may think, for such a small volume, can they just put a battery it in, or just a screen and keyboard in it. No, they put the whole computer in it, and super fast, last super long on the battery.  I have used computers for more than 30 years and I have to say, this is the summit of our civilization.
"
Harold T. McLaughlin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great out of the box, then slowly the battery life started decreasing, the constant hard reboots to get Safari back up and running, inexplicably running hot, and crashing more often than a Windows machine. Simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot.,I firmly believe that Apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out, but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the M1x or M2 processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothly.,UPDATE: There are other emerging issues.,In Safari, the keystrokes to italicize ""Command+I"" will randomly switch to opening up a new email message, and the keystrokes to convert text to LaTeX, ""command+shift+L"" now inexplicably opens the left panel. I am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere.

  I have big hands. This computer was not made for anyone who has large hands. My hands cramp constant as i type and i cannot get a bigger/better computer because of how much i have already spent. It is extremely frustrating. It is so small. I mistype constantly and have accidentally deleted many important things!!! This computer also glitches ALOT. It is constantly changing my mouse from “single click” to “double” . It constantly opens new tabs and new pages for no reason. Waste of money. Just buy a pc. I am regretful

  My 2018 MBA died (logic board).  It was 2-1/2 years old.  Apple quoted $500 to repair it.  The repair came with a 90 day warranty.  They told me that if I had purchased Apple Care, it would have been covered.  If I had purchased Apple Care on all of the Apple computers I've purchased over the past 25 years I could have bought 2-3 brand new MacBook Airs.  Used to be a fan of Apple.

  The move to M1 has made this model an instant classic.

"
Gregory,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This M1 is such a leap ahead for Apple. It has great battery life, no heat, and is fast and versatile. I  ordered the 512 model, but as a casual user, I don’t know if I will ever use all that memory. I think that many people could order the 256 base model, and save some bucks. An external drive is cheaper than built in memory. The fingerprint sensor is wonderful!

  Bought one directly from Apple. I was excited to see how nice it would be to use since I had recently moved over to using an iPhone and was impressed at how it had improved over the years. All the positive reviews and videos everywhere made this seem like a great product. Don’t be fooled. Please. This is one of the most disappointing and frustrating pieces of tech I’ve ever had the displeasure of getting to use. Never have I seen or used a computer that had so many options that you will never need. Missing options you should always have. And not be capable of preforming basic tasks without bugging out. To those saying this is one of the best computers you’ve ever used… have you ever used a computer before? Anytime within the last 10-15 years? I’m willing to bet not.
"
Dean W,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's 2021 and Apple is STILL ripping it's customers off by only including 8 GB's of RAM as the standard configuration.  Even worse is they rip you off again if you purchase this item with 16 GB's of RAM, which is what it should have in the first place!  And of course, there's not an option for a user upgrade.  Ridiculous for the price they charge for their laptops!!

  Dropped about $2500 on 3 of these roughly 3 years ago.  One had battery issues, one had logic board failure which Apple would not cover, and 3rd is doing fine.  Apple has kept up with design quality, camera is top notch, but does not meet quality expectations overall.  With the reduced cost of Windows machines, may be time to step out of my Apple bubble.

  Update 09/01/21:,Still going strong!,Unreal has really smoothed out the bugs. This thing is an absolute beast, beats my old desktop easily.,I can run Photoshop, Unreal, Lots of tabs in safari/firefox, and background processes; all no issues. Heck, I can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background. I've rarely noticed slowdowns, and when I have it's always been a software issue (typically memory leaks).,I've abandoned windows... Haven't loaded it outside of a VM more than a few times this year. Don't hesitate to get this if you're looking for a new laptop.,Update 01/11/21:,Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.,I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.,Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.,Initial post:,Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.,This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.,Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.,Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.

Turkey_jelly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First let's start with the overall look of the MacBook Air, it's thin, sleek and super light.  I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver & gold. But after receiving my gold Mac, I'm so happy I went with it. The color looks so much BETTER in person, it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it, it looks gold.,I use my Mac for some web searching, emails ( when I do so the battery does good) and if I'm doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster. I spent all day on it and it does not get hot, so that's a plus. I don't feel like I have to give it a break.,I got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there ( if needed),Now the camera! it's terrible LOL but that doesn't bother me much because I won't be using or doing any zoom calls. But i wish apple would make it better since it's not a cheap lap top.,I also came from not having a lap top, So far is perfect for me and what I use it for. I love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails, txt , calendar etc......,I also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen.
"
Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love everything Apple did to update the Air. It’s, by far, the best laptop you can buy right now. That’s especially true if you were a Mac user before. I wasn’t, so I had to learn where everything was and what not, but it didn’t take to long.,The battery life is PHENOMENAL and I have had 0 issues with the thermals. When Apple said it would cool passively, they weren’t lying. I’ve had 8-9 programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer, but nothing compared to any other laptop I’ve used. The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.,I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.,The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.,Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now.

Tristan A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under EXTREME loads. I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about. ( I'll try to answer some questions I had ) It does come sealed in the original Apple packaging and it does have the M1 chip. All around I highly recommend this. It's amazing for the price tag.

  I've been using Mac laptops for 30 years (yes before there were Macbooks) and this is my favorite yet.,With this Macbook Air I'm coming from an 8 year old MacBook Pro. In comparison, it is:,Super light. Feels like carrying a book.,Great feeling keyboard.,Fast.,Excellent battery life.,Beautiful display.,Overall, I am more productive and happy since I started using this MacBook Air!,(When I first got it there were some bugs but perhaps they fixed them in Big Sur. It's been 3 months now, smooth sailing.),CONS:,I hate Apple so much for changing the USB port. You need to buy an adapter for any external drives with the standard old USB cord to work. I bought a beautiful cover for my MacBook but they didn't plan for the fact that many people would be plugging in a long adapter so I have to take the shell off. Did I say I hate Apple for doing this?

  I've owned my fair share of laptops and let me tell you.. Nothing even comes close to this. Spectacular battery life, incredible display, tactile keyboard and haptic track pad with all its' gestures and features which makes multitasking a wonderful experience. to top it all off, Big Sur (os) wraps it all up and makes your workflow the greatest pleasure. Only thing I would change is the camera. It is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark. Putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and I understand that. Having a display this thin comes with its' sacrifices. If I could give this laptop 10 stars I would. Don't hesitate on purchasing it, you won't regret it.

  Love it. I wish they would upgrade the damn cameras but it does the job. I’m not using it to take photos. But as far meetings go it would be nice. I didn’t realize I was running like 6 different programs. This thing performs without any slow down. I learn something new about it everyday. I love that my phone, my watch and my laptop all talk to each other. So no matter where I write it is saved to the iCloud. Happy with my purchase. Got the headphones and Magic Mouse too.

  It's just amazing !! this one with the m1 chip is a game changing , but i highly recommend to get the extra storage and the 16 gb ram i mean am not saying that the 8 gb ram won't work but i highly recommend to get the 16 gb ram if you're looking to run multiple tasks on this MacBook or playing games from steam .

  After years of using nothing but PC laptops, the M1 chip compelled me to try Macs. And let me tell you, the hype is justified. The new silicon MacBooks are simply incredible. The ARM-based silicon chip is so amazing that I was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides, which are the 720p webcam, lack of SD card slot, and not being able to upgrade RAM or SSD. Despite these drawbacks, the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heat-efficient. You're also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of Windows laptops in the market. To top it off, you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame, a beautiful aluminum design, and build quality that will last. Well done Apple.

  Comprei esse note pra duas coisas: trabalhar como desenvolver de software + estudar como cientista da computação, e só tenho a dizer que minha experiência tem sido absolutamente incrível. Até o momento (quase 2 meses de uso) já trabalhei com Java, Python e C. Dessas linguagens, tive problemas com algumas bibliotecas muito específicas de C e só. Java e Python funcionaram 10/10 sem nenhuma ""bruxaria"" feita por trás dos panos.,Also, uso o Intellij IDEA + VSCode, e ambos vem funcionando incrivelmente bem, zero travamentos ou delays, nadinha. Completamente perfeitos.,Quanto ao uso de estudante, é mais Word/OneNote/Chrome, e a experiência também é maravilhosa. Nada de problemas, nada de delays, nada de erros, nada de nada. Somente sorrisos e alegrias.,Inclusive, adquiri o CleanMyMac, que recorrentemente me lança um warning dizendo ""opa, tua memória (8GB) tá no limite, libera um pouco aí"" e mesmo eu ignorando totalmente esse warning, o sistema continua rodando completamente lisinho, rápido, alternando entre quantos apps eu quiser (IntelliJ, Postman, Chrome, SQLWorkbench...), de forma que minha experiência não foi nadinha comprometida. O único problema que pode vir a rolar é com Docker, mas por mais que eu tenha instalado, ainda não subi nenhum container pra fazer o teste, então não sei dizer.,Em resumo -> comprem sem medo, é perfeito.

   Amei! Vale muito a pena. Depois de tentar inúmeras vezes em outras lojas e ter diversos problemas com a transação, a amazon foi a única empresa que foi incrivelmente rápida com a resposta e aprovação. No dia seguinte o vendedor enviou, e como precisava rapidamente para continuar o meu trabalho, chegou em dois dois aproximadamente.,Vamos lá: acho que merece uma avaliação extensa.,O processador M1 equivale a um intel I9. se o uso for mt pesado recomendo pegar o de 512 gb/16 gb ram. O meu de 8 está segurando bem. Utiliso obs estudio, faço streaming, mas n trabalho com cinema ou coisas que demandem muitas edições pesadas.,10- A bateria me surpreendeu. Demora muito pra descarregar. Autonomia de 10 horas. Acima do normal. ( Todas essas impressões se aplicam há uma semana),10- teclado. Delicioso de teclar. Recomendo colocar proteção por ser um apple. Nada se consegue modificar muito.,10- design. NUNCA vi algo tão fininho. Leve e o tamanho é perfeito se vc quer mobilidade.,Pontos negativos:,Alguns app nativos você não consegue deletar ( ocupa a memória),Obsolescência programada gigante ( money),>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>,N recomendo instalar todas as atualizacoes que eles mandam antes de 6 meses. Verifique antes. Pesquise. Eles ja me mandaram algo e eu ainda n fiz.,Peças soldadas, pelo que pesquisei não é possível aumentar a memória dele. caso o meu uso aumente a demanda vou precisar trocar. ( Capitalista, porém n é só algo dessa empresa em si. Vale a pena o investimento mas pense bem e faça muita pesquisa e testes baseados no seu uso),USB - o usb dele é o novo. Prepare o bolso pra gastar entre 100/200 pilas pra comprar um hub com umas 4 ou 5 usbs se seu uso for intenso. Tem outros mais baratos mas n vi nada,confiável por menos de 90.,Vendedor ótimo, gostaria de agradecer muito. Mudou meu trabalho e sou eternamente grata. Estou deixando logo a avaliação pra que vc possa receber tudo o quanto antes. Só me preocupo se perco algo deixando antes do tempo? Acho que não né, estou usando e por enquanto te sendo ótimo. Sou muito cuidadosa., Bom, de toda forma é uma máquina linda e potente. Pra um uso leve/moderado.,Se vc acha que vc precisa investir em algo, vai colher bons frutos. Mas pesquise se esse modelo é o exato.

  I needed a new laptop quickly after I accidentally drowned my previous MacBook Air (reached for a bottle of water without taking my eyes off the screen, didn't realize the bottle was uncapped, and...sploosh! One waterlogged keyboard, plus one soaked and angry cat who'd been napping peacefully beside me on the couch.) Ordered this one quickly on someone else's computer and it arrived the next day. I'm no computer genius and am way older than the generation that grew up with assorted devices in their hands from babyhood, so there are still a lot of things I haven't figured out how to do. But I quickly (for me) got the new one filling my basic needs, and am working on what else it can do.,Not a very useful review for those who want technical details, sorry! More of a reassurance that if you need a laptop that is user-friendly when you're not a knowledgeable user, this one will do the job nicely.

Astria Ferrão,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Perfeito como era de se esperar, com entrega a jato! Estava previsto pra chegar entre 27 e 30 de abril. Comprei dia 13 e chegou dia 15! Quanto ao computador não tenho nem o que dizer, já é meu terceiro MacBook Air, desde 2011 e ainda tenho os outros dois sendo usados pelos meus filhos, quase sem nenhum problema, que  mesmo quando aparecem são coisas pequenas e plenamente resolvidos pelas assistência técnica on-line, que tem os melhores atendentes que já vi na vida. O preço continua sendo alto demais para o Brasil, mas frente aos outros no mercado, vale cada centavo suado gasto. Esse modelo é ágil, tem como novidade touch para senhas e o teclado é maravilhoso. Super rápido o processador e a memória de 8Gb era o que faltava pra mim, pois dando aulas on-line uso muitos programas conectados ao mesmo tempo e meu MacBook antigo com 4Gb não estava conseguindo dar conta. Mas será perfeito pra minha filha que não usará poucos programas. Já era e continuo sendo fã total, melhores compras sempre são dos produtos Apple. Só queria ganhar melhor pra poder investir mais.
"
Nataly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Computador muito bom. Migrei do Windows para Mac e em primeiro momento acaba sendo um pouco complicado, muitos atalhos conhecidos são diferentes o que te faz ficar um pouco perdido, mas tudo é bem intuitivo para facilitar a adaptação, ainda mais se já for um usuário de outros produtos Apple. O trackpad é ótimo com os gestos, autonomia de bateria dispensa comentários. Não testei para jogos e apps mais pesados, por enquanto apenas em uso comum então não posso opinar muito apropriadamente sobre o sistema de refrigeração, mas para meu uso, não senti o notebook esquentando. Em resumo (e lembrando, minha opinião PESSOAL): se você tem condições de adquirir uma máquina desta mesmo que seu intuito não seja uso mais profissional (ou seja, na contramão do que a maioria diz ser o ""correto""), ainda acredito que vale a pena pela portabilidade, fluidez do sistema e bateria, além das atualizações e suporte garantidos pelos próximos vários anos. O que enxergo de negativo é o preço, mas ultimamente nada está ""barato"" e a longo prazo o custo acaba se pagando.

  I recently bought a MacBook Air after my 2011 iMac had to be retired. I saw reviews about the new M1 processer in the new mac line up so out of curiosity I had to try it out for myself and I have been a fan of Arm processors for many years. It has exceeded my expectations and then some when it comes to programming, audio, some gaming and everyday computing. This is an excellent machine and the craftsmanship that went into it and its overall design is second to none. This the fastest mac I have owned. I have been an apple user since 1984. It deserves an extra star. TY Amazon.

Devin Wood,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The product seemed to have light signs of use, including a pin size dent/chip in the aluminum on the side, what seemed like sticker residue on strange spots of the bottom casing, and a few scuff marks that could be wiped off with a cloth. However, I don't think that I'll process a return as it's more hassle than it's worth given only a minor cosmetic defect. Aluminum is soft, and marks like these will show up anyways with regular handling in a month.,The MacBook performs quite well, and the keyboard is a welcomed upgrade. Coming from a 2018 MBP (13"", i5), the M1 Air is snappy and more comfortable to type on (partially due to the angled design). Time will tell if I have the plethora of issues I had with my 2018 MBP, but I'm optimistic.

  I replaced an Intel powered Macbook with this Macbook Air M1. We mostly use it for Zoom meetings and the Intel Macbook battery would die after only about 75 minutes. This new M1 powered Macbook just goes on and on. Not all applications (minor) run on it but Zoom is totally compatible. Yes Zoom is a system resources hog but the M1 just does not seem to notice. And super Apple quality as always.

  O produto é perfeito, do jeitinho que eu queria, a cor é maravilhosa, parece que ele muda de cor de acordo com a luz, extremamente rápido, não tenho muito o que opinar sobre a Apple, já que sou completamente apaixonada por todos os produtos. Pesquisei muito antes de comprar, já que seria meu primeiro computador que seria meu mesmo, por isso não gostaria de comprar algo meia boca ou que não fosse pra ficar por muito tempo. Tive o Macbook White Duo de 2008 se eu não me engano, ele era do meu irmão e ele passou para mim, ou seja, o computador durou pelo menos 13 anos, dava pequenos defeitos, como qualquer outro, mas que não fossem resolvidos rapidamente...,Estou apaixonada pelo computador e imensamente grata pelo vendedor ter enviado tão rapidamente.

  Não posso dizer que me arrependi da compra, mas o Notebook é extremamente restrito!,O que você precisa saber:,Não instala: Facebook, Instagram, nenhum App de Banco exceto Itau, Mercado Bitcoin e outros Apps (Safra, XP e afins). Para você que gosta de jogos, Free Fire e Pugb, não pega, você tem que baixar um App Chinês que a Apple já bloqueou o acesso!,Há 6 meses daria para baixar os Apps que tem no Iphone pelo Imazing, mas a Apple também já bloqueou também!,Pontos positivos, leve, confortável, rápido e bonito, porém, se você está comprando para praticidade de não ficar no celular o tempo todo e transpor, esquece! Porque você consegue acessar tudo, mas pelo Safari apenas.,-> O que você consegue baixar: Google Chrome, Spotify, Lojas Americanas, Telegram, WhatsApp, vincular suas fotos, alguns jogos de gráficos fantásticos disponíveis no Arcade ou App Store, mas nenhum que seja do EA Sports ou Windows (como Free Fire, Pugb, etc), aplicativos de edição de fotos e vídeos.,-> Não consegue baixar: Aplicativos de investimentos (Mercado Bitcoin, XP, Safra) e nem aplicativo de Banco (exceto Itaú), não consegue baixar os principais jogos (Free Fire, GTA 5, Pugb, FIFA, etc), não consegue baixar YouTube, só pelo Safari, não consegue baixar Facebook e Instagram, só também pelo Safari.,Existem ferramentas no YouTube que ensinam baixar clandestinamente, mas correm o risco de danificar o sistema, pois a maioria são chineses ilegais.,Espero ter ajudado na sua decisão!

"
Bernardo Walmott Borges,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excelente máquina. Já tinha lido várias avaliações de desempenho do produto e comprei com consciência. Vários programas ainda não são nativos para o chip Apple Silicon (M1), ainda usam o emulador Rosetta 2.0, mas em breve serão adaptados. Tela, bateria e desempenho excelentes. Eu tinha um Macbook Air early 2014 (i5, 4GB, 128 GB SSD) e já não tinha o que reclamar. Imaginem agora...,A questão do ""refurbished"" levantada em outro comentário deve ser vista com cautela. Primeiro, ""refurbished"" é diferente de ""repaired"": o primeiro é feito pela Apple e, na prática, torna o produto indistinguível de um novo. ""Repaired"" é feito em uma loja qualquer (que não a Apple). Segundo, a condição deve estar indicada na caixa do produto, que não foi o caso o Macbook que comprei. Essa ideia de que tudo que está disponível no Brasil é de segunda mão deve ser desmistificada.

Estou usando a apenas uma semana e não tenho nada a reclamar, o chip M1 está dando conta de tudo que fiz no momento, a tela 4k é linda, ele possui ótima qualidade de som, a bateria dura no mínimo em torno de 16 horas, não esquenta, não faz barulho, é um produto caro, mas se você realmente estiver disposto e puder investir num produto de qualidade e longevidade garanto que não vão se arrepender.

  Já estava acostumado a usar MB há um bom tempo. Tenho 2 MBP novos e precisava comprar um laptop para a minha mãe.

Fiquei impressionado com a rapidez e fluidez do aparelho mesmo executando tarefas mais complexas. Além disso, a bateria dura muuuuuito!

  Primeiro queria falar do vendedor que foi SUPER atencioso comigo. Eu tinha muita urgência nesse macbook porque precisava trabalhar e estava sem computador. Mandei mensagem pra eles pedindo se poderiam me ajudar, enviando o mais rápido possível, e pra minha surpresa eles responderam na hora, agilizando o processo e a entrega. Chegou em 3 dias úteis, a partir da data da compra, se não me engano. O motoboy só entregou o produto quando EU desci, com documento em mãos, e assinei pela entrega. O que foi incrível porque você não tem perigo de perder o produto, fica super confiante né, afinal é um produto mega caro pra que seja perdido no meio do caminho...,E aí sobre o produto, bom, não tem muito o que falar né. Quem tem produtos Apple sabe a qualidade de tudo que eles fazem. Estou com ele há 1 semana, usando insanamente pro trabalho e ele não falhou uma única vez. A bateria dura MUITO, a cor é linda, veio tudo embaladinho e lacrado, com NF já no pacote do lado de fora pra não ter erro.,Legal também que quando você cadastra seu macbook ele te dá 1 ano de Apple TV e 3 meses de Apple Arcade.,É um alto investimento? Sim. Mas se você precisa do computador como ferramenta de trabalho, como eu, vale cada centavo.

Gustavo Rafael Kühl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Depois de muitos anos de Windows, mesmo já tendo tido altas aventuras no Linux, usar o MacOS como sistema principal é uma experiência totalmente nova, principalmente usando com o teclado o MacBook. Pra quem não sabe, o Mac não possui as teclas alt e (obviamente) Windows, sendo alteradas para option e Command, que possuem um comportamento semelhante, apesar de que mesmo depois de 1 mês, ainda estou me estranhando um pouco com o layout desse teclado, e creio que esses sejam os pontos que mais me marcaram a respeito dessa mudança.

  Gostei bastante do produto. É o meu primeiro mac. Sempre vim de plataformas Windows. Mas como tenho desenvolvido aplicações mobile achei cômodo comprar um Mac para o desenvolvimento e me surpreendi com esse processador M1. Ele é incrível. O que a Apple fez foi algo surreal. O sistema operacional é perfeito. O Trackpad é ótimo até comprei um magictrackpad 2. Qnto ao teclado não curti tanto. Tenho usado o Mx keys da logitech. De resto é um ótimo notebook. Pretendo ficar na Apple a partir de agora.

  Sim, vc n leu errado, e a primeira vez que da pra falar que um produto da Apple vale aquilo que se paga em comparação com a concorrência, e grande parte disso se deve ao novo chip M1, extremamente rápido e dando coro em I9.,E o meu primeiro produto Apple, e eu não poderia recomendar mais, e literalmente outro nível... O trackpad e unico, ninguém consegue chegar perto nesse quesito, a tela e extremamente nítida e vibrante em cores, o teclado e confortável, e a experiencia de um modo geral no MacOS e infinitamente melhor do que na porcaria do Windows, seja para trabalhar ou um uso mais comum.,Recomendo o produto com todas as letras, valeu a pena cada centavo.

  O pessoal da YesShop realmente foram atenciosos as perguntas que fiz no pós compra (fui checar uma vez mais para ver se não era fake) e foi fantástico, tudo certo, o Mac chegou e é realmente muito produtivo trabalhar com ele, programar para Web é uma experiência fantástica (mas se você desenvolver para Mobile sugiro ficar pelo intel ainda ou aguardar os updates da arquitetura M1), para dos demais fins de trabalho Edição de imagem e vídeo através do Roseta é muito mais performático que no Windows. Dia a dia e lazer são outras coisas que você pode fazer nessa máquina, mas não recomendo algo de valor tão alto para isso (embora a qualidade seja fantástica)
"
Cliente,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  O MacBook Air M1 é realmente uma nova experiência em termos de processamento e fluidez. A Apple acerta mais uma vez! Meu pedido veio com Nota Fiscal e chegou antes do previsto, porém a entrega foi feita pelos Correios e a caixa estava com um furo (como se alguém tivesse tentado violar o produto). Ainda bem que a caixa do MacBook em si estava intacta.

  Vendedor Eden Store extremamente atencioso, entrou em contato por mensagem e telefone para confirmar dados e esclarecer dúvidas, enviou adaptador do carregador para tomada brasileira. Produto chegou muito rápido dentro de 1-2 dias e sem defeitos. Parabéns pelo atendimento! Quanto às qualidades e “limitações” do produto nada a acrescentar, cumpre com tudo o que promete, o comprador é que tem que estar atento as configurações necessárias para seu uso pessoal.
"
Matheus Vinícius,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  O produto chegou antes do prazo de entrega e foi muito bem embalado. O vendedor me enviou a NF do produto por email assim que pedir.,A respeito do produto não tem o que falar, Apple é Apple, produto muito bem construído, acabamento impecável e experiência única ao utilizar o produto. Falo por experiência se você está na dúvida se compra ou não, vale cada centavo, o produto é extremamente rápido e vai dar conta de tudo o que você precisar fazer, falo isso pois sou desenvolvedor de software e mesmo o macbook air com o chip m1 dá conta de tudo o que preciso fazer e não faz feio não. Excelente produto, ótimo acabamento e preço bom em relação a outras lojas.

Cliente Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Maravilhoso. Rápido e incrivelmente eficiente. Uso basicamente para estudos, escrita e internet. Fácil de transportar pois é leve e compacto. Qualidade Apple inegável em cada detalhe, inclusive na beleza. Vale o preço!

ThriveWell Counselling,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This new MacBook is fast and reliable. I was having troubles with the new Windows-based computer I bought, and I need a compact, fast computer to meet all of my business needs. I'm very happy to be back with a Mac, and this one is so light and 'Airy' not bulky at all (size and ease of use)! Much better than the older, clunky MacBook Pro I had in the past!
"
Mayara V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Jader M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Foi uma excelente escolha, preço bom, cashback do bando inter e a melhor experiência de compra, sobre a Apple não precisa falar, o mac é lindo, leve, excelente bateria e muito rápido. O produto veio muito bem embalado e protegido, com nota e ainda me mandaram o adaptador da tomada (perfeito) e chegou muuuito rápido. No mesmo dia registrei na Apple e ainda ganha 1 ano de AppleTV grátis. Melhor comprar que já fiz!
"
Dee Machado Menezes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Entrega rápida, muito bem embalado e embalagem discreta (fundamental para a nossa realidade).,É muito caro mesmo sendo um notebook incrível. Mas vou fazer propaganda gratuita pra a Amazon; pesquisei na época em vários sites de compras e aqui estava mil reais abaixo. Acreditei, comprei e tô que é só alegria!
"
Ana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Perfeito, estava querendo um macbook faz tempo, estou feliz com a compra, o produto é caro, mas acredito que vai valer a pena visto que dura a beça, comprei um Multilaser que não durou nem dois anos, 2mil jogado no lixo, agora paguei alto, mas vamos ver… Vendedor me enviou nota fiscal por e-mail, tudo certo.
"
Edval Tenório Júnior,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Bianca Moresco,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sempre fui usuária de macbook e como designer sempre utilizei o macbook pro, porém o Air com chip M1 atendeu 100% a todas as minhas necessidades. Já estou há duas semanas utilizando ele e não tenho nenhuma consideração negativa a fazer. Desempenho excelente!

"
Gabriella Ramiro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Acredito que todos tenhamos receios em fazer comprar on-line, mas o produto chegou de acordo a expectativa! E muito melhor acredito! Chegou antes do prazo previsto, com um ótimo atendimento pois no meu cadastro foi sem o número do endereço, e eles se preocuparam em me procurar para corrigir o erro! Mandaram um adaptador, provando que realmente se preocupam com o cliente! Com certeza indicarei a loja de vocês!
"
VINICIUS SANTOS DEFENSOR MENEZES,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Notebook original. Liga e funciona rapidamente. Leve e muito prático. Bateria com ótima duração. Como todos os produtos da Apple, o preço não é o mais acessível, mas, qualquer notebook atualmente está com preço alto.

"
Thawane Gomes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Não tenho oq falar, é Apple, não tem comparação, a velocidade, a qualidade é indiscutível e fora que o custo benefício valeu a pena, paguei a metade que o Macbook custa, um Macbook Air da última geração, o vendedor é confiável, enviou a nota fiscal por email, tudo certo, eu só precisei ligar na Apple para validar a compra e a garantia está tudo certo tbm. Podem comprar sem medo!

"
gilson fonsaca,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A máquina é muito rápida, bateria dura mesmo umas 10 hrs tranquilo. Único problema dela é que como se trata de um processador ARM, alguns programas não rodam porque ainda não foram portados pra essa arquitetura. Tirando isso, é perfeita.
"
Flavio Luiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Agora estou muito satisfeto com meu macbook air, porem quando comprei ele nao estava carregando, liguei para a apple agendei um genius bar e eles diagnosticaram que era um defeito no cabo usbc e trocaram sem custo, agora está carregando perfeitamente.
"
Rogerio Caetano,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A Apple sempre tem um padrão de qualidade, porém os custos atuais tem dificultado, mas vale o investimento, caso não precise de um equipamento com mais memória e espaço de armazenamento.
"
Celia C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sou Mac há muito tempo. Esse é meu segundo MacBook Air. Ele manteve a tela de 13 pol, mas ficou mais leve. Super-rápido!  O único ""defeito"" é que ele tem apenas duas USB-C (Thunderbolt) para tudo. É preciso comprar à parte um adaptador para poder usar qualquer tipo de acessório com USB normal, ou HDMI, etc.
"
Barbara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Francisco Carlos da Silva Junior,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sem duvidas. Melhor coisa que comprei na vida. Sensacional. E chegou super rápido. Tipo, cinco dias! E moro na região nordeste do Brasil.,Recomendo. A nota fiscal não veio no produto, porem, ao mandar mensagem ao vendedor a nota fiscal foi enviada em cinco minutos.,Então, recomendo demais ....
"
Sueli,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Se tem uma coisa que é verdade é:  a gente acostuma muito rápido com coisa boa. Eu tinha um Macbook Pro antigo. Por não poder mais atualizar o sistema, eu resolvi comprar esse. No início, pouquíssimo estranhamento. Agora eu sinto estranheza com o antigo.. rssss
"
Carlos Rian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Melhor notebook que já tive até o momento, faz juz ao ao preço, inclusive acho o preço justo para um produto que entrega a qualidade que ele entrega. O desempenho é absurdo, sem dúvidas eu não trocaria ele por um dell, asus, samsung etc. Pois um Dell XPS i7 tá 11k e não entrega o desempenho do M1 nem a pau.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Computador leve, potente e facil de utilizar. Aplicações de video, imagens e interatividade como treinamento.
"
Catia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A entrega atrasou uns dois ou três dias.,A embalagem do produto veio lacrada, mas a caixa do correio estava rasgada reforçada com fita, devido a um adaptador solto que foi fornecido, pois o original da caixa era de pinos chatos, como achei de coloração diferente acabei adaptando outro original.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Quem está acostumado a usar o Mac vai possivelmente ficar apaixonado por esse modelo do air. Simples, sempre intuitivo e lindo. Som excelente, imagem muito bom e o processador tem uma velocidade impressionante.
"
João Pedro Moreira de Oliveira,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No momento atual do Brasil, com todos os computadores mais premium todos custando muita grana, MacBook, apesar de continuar sendo muito caro, acaba sendo uma excelente opção por questão de durabilidade, portabilidade, design e muito mais.
"
Shayane Bezerra dos Santos,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
MARCIO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Comprei há um mês, demorei uns dias para me adaptar e agora me pergunto porque não o fiz antes. É um excelente investimento.,P.S.: se você precisar utilizar acessórios que precisam de uma entrada USB, será preciso investir em um hub.
"
CLÁUDIA M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  mac muito bonito, processador super rápido; até agora os únicos pontos negativos é a tomada que é modelo americano, mas troquei com a mac anterior e não há entrada USB, é necessário comprar um adaptar. Por enquanto estou muito satisfeita.
"

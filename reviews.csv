Leo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Alright so I took a leap of faith after reading the reviews saying that this specific phone was a ""Fake"" and that it freezes. I personally haven't encountered any issues with freezing, it isn't a fake iphone either. People are just ignorant or something.,LETS TALK ABOUT TO THE PROS,Screen quality and build quality is amazing. Colors pop out and look fantastic. Camera detail in the photos are a really great. The 120hz refresh rate on the screen is in fact very noticeable when using it compared to an older model like the 10 or even 11. This is an absolute upgrade from those models. The pro max is a bit on the heavier side but you'll get used to it. I also already had cricket previously so i just slapped the same sim card and it worked with zero problems. zero hardware/software issues with new the iOS,LETS TALK ABOUT THE CONS,Price for some people may scare them off, but it's apple. This is to be expected.,The shiny metallic sides are finger print magnets and it can be obnoxious. Just get a clear case and don't stress over it.

  Battery life is amazing, one charge over night and it’s alive all day, the camera is definitely better quality. The audio is very loud which is a good thing. The only problem is that I’ve only had the phone for like 5 days and it’s been freezing on me sometimes which is definitely worrisome

  100% the phone is good but the network cricket wireless please please it's not good don't go through doctor Carrier it's a really bad service I live in Minneapolis and I'm getting

  Very nice typical iPhone with a great screen. I tried to like it but it bored me. I'm a n Android-ite forever. For iPhone lovers they'll like it.

  This phone is not a bad phone, do not use the Sim card that came with the phone. Take it to a cricket store and get it set up there. I have been trying to get my phone fixed all day long from the time they open to the time that they closed and nobody could get into my account, somehow my account got canceled without my permission. The mobile data did not work from the time that I got the phone and it was very difficult to receive any SMS messages. If you need a phone just go to the store my situation maybe unique I may have just gotten a bad Sim card attached to a number that didn’t get fully released in their computers all I know is it was aggravating and costly..

  This IPhone pro max is the absolute valued phone for the price, Amazon offer is the great value amongst any retailer that I believe in.

VP,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this phone. Camera is very good and software creates nice short videos of recent trip. I wasn't able to get this phone with Tmobile before my trip so got the cricket service. It wasn't so great in Mexico. Service was slow when it worked. My old tmobile phone worked fine.

Nancy O.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  For the money that it cost, I was expecting a little more from it. Some of it may be because of my age. I’m a senior and this is my 3 iPhone. Apparently doesn’t like my face, always have to put in my pin. The camera is really good, the battery last a couple of days.,Hopefully this phone will last a long time.

  Great buy!
"
Meir ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like iPads, and I like this one, but this is such a minor upgrade, no new screen, the M1 chip is cool but pointless, there are 0 apps or tasks on iPad that will take full advantage of this, NONE.,I would love to see apple bringing some heavy apps to the iPad, that will actually take advantage of 16 (!) gigs of RAM and the M1 chip, or at least make iPadOS more powerful, better multitasking and resizable windows, I will edit this review accordingly!
"
Michelle Osborne,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm giving this a three star rating because if you haven't had an iPad to compare it to, you'd probably find it a major upgrade from a generic $60 tablet. You might even find it an upgrade over a $100 tablet. But if you've owned the regular iPad, you're going to be sorely disappointed.,(1)The screen is a lint magnet. You'll need to clean it every hour if you intend on long stretches of reading.,(2) Plan to spend the rest of your life charging it. If you're a big reader, it's not functional for a 5 hour reading session. They claim the battery life is 13 hours, but I call bull on this. Six hours is a stretch. While it's possible I got a defective tablet, I doubt it. Videos especially drain it, about 20% every hour.,(3) The picture quality. My God, the picture/video quality. I had the 2020 iPad 10.2-inch. So I was expecting a major upgrade over this. It wasn't. It's a downgrade. In fact, it's so questionable I believe Apple outright lied about the 4K video and/or pixels on the camera. Once again, it's possible I got a defective iPad Pro 11"", but I doubt it.,Those are three major flaws that will make this my last iPad Pro. It's not an upgrade over the regular 10.2"" iPad. The top and bottom bezels are a little smaller and it's definitely thinner, but I enjoyed the picture quality on the regular iPad more. The thickness of the tablet seemed to give depth to the pictures. I read a lot of online comics, and those comics looked better on the regular iPad than they do the Pro, which was a shock.,I've never had an iPad air. I skipped it and went straight to this one. I got the 11"" because I'm not very strong and believed the 12.9"" would be too laptop like and heavy. I already have a laptop, so I was going for portability. I do like the 11""'s thinness, style, and look. It's beautiful, especially when it's in the Smart Folio.,As for performance, picture, and video quality: The regular 2020 10.2"" iPad is just as good, and I'm not saying that because I have a vendetta against Apple (although I do resent them calling this a ""pro"" anything. Not even close). This tablet is just as good - and bad - as the regular iPad, and they've hiked the price up $400 for no reason. I don't care what they're calling the tech in this iPad. It actually boots up in about the same time as the regular iPad, and even if it didn't, I liked the picture on the regular iPad just as much.,This is not worth the money or even close.

Vaibhav,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It is the fastest and the lightest iPad Pro. Looks excellent. The camera is the best part especially the front camera with center stage. The display is good with 120Hz refresh rate. However it's not worth an upgrade if you already have iPad Pro 2020 model until Apple announces something which will take advantage of the M1 chip set. I wish 11 inch model had the same liquid retina XDR display like the 12.9 inch model. The battery life is excellent provided with a 20W charger. Everything else is good.
"
AT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pros:,Fast and will be for many years,High quality, feels, and looks nice,Speakers are really good,Face ID,Cons:,For some, 128 GB may not be enough. If you are a heavy user, get the 256.,It's expensive,If you're looking at this versus the Air, it really depends on what you need for storage. If you primarily want to use your iPad for streaming media or looking up things and don't really need a whole lot of storage, get the Air with 64 GB. If you need more than 64 GB and don't need 256 then go with this model. If you do need 256 then you need to weigh the differences and figure out if the pro upgrade is worth $150 to you.
"
Computer Clinic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Noticeably faster than the 2020 IPad Pro. Maxed out all 3D Mark benchmarks. Pretty impressed with the M1 Chip
"
Arin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m a fairly new tablet user. I’ve only used one other iPad besides this but I’m in love with it! I mostly use it for procreate, the new M1 chip and refresh rate makes drawing feel nice and smooth, even more so with a matte screen protector.
"
Lance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This tablet is amazing! So incredibly fast! I love the Apple pencil and the magic keyboard is a must! If you're in the market for a great iPad I recommend either the iPad air 4 or this one, don't get 2018/2020 iPad pro, they're considerably slower with an A12 based chip.  This one will last a lot longer though having at least 8GB RAM in the base model. Seriously if you want the best fastest tablet ever get this, you definitely get what you pay for in the base model ($799). I needed the 120hz for drawing with the pencil, the input lag is so much better over the iPad air 4.
"
Jimmy Brungus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing tablet. Love the 120hz screen, as well as the power and efficiency of the m1 chip. Because of the new chip, battery life is nuts on the 11in model, although for most use cases the power is overkill. But, that will just ensure the device remains usable for years to come. Perfect tablet, and I’d recommend it to everyone if the base model wasn’t so expensive.

  This item arrived defective. Apple would not replace the item because I did not buy the Care Plan.  I was shocked.  Apple has certainly changed how it views its customers.
"
OPC,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Most recent model is 5th generation iPad Pro in 2021.  However what I received is 3rd generation (not even 4th)!  What a huge disappointment.  Description says 2021 iPad….  And it is carefully designed scheme to deceive customers into buying old model while price difference is not clear or non-existent

cathy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So looking forward to using this watch too bad I now have to wait for the charge block that comes separately( for an extra charge),Why isn’t that made clear when you order it. Not happy!! So unfortunately I can’t review anything until it’s charged.
"
Scott (Ft Wayne),5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a lot less expensive than the series 6 and 7.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles those series have, but they weren't important to me.  This is by far the best smart watch I've ever owned.  It just works so well with my iPhone 11.  I love being able to read a message or notification, and then clear it on the watch, and it's also cleared from my phone as well.  There are a lot of apps available for it too.  It also does a great job of monitoring my heart rate and I have some heart problems, so this is great!  The vibration is also very good which is important to me as a deaf person.
"
Honest Reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  i was actually hesitant to get the Apple watch due to fear of radiation ...but, after about 2 years of holding out, i decided to do it and glad i did. the only disappointment is that i went with the SE and not the series 6 or 7 which have the EKG function.  I think the EKG function is super cool...but oh well....otherwise, the watch has everything i need...gives me text alerts, different watch faces, can answer calls (I don't have the cell plan so its not stand alone), a timer, bpm, and exercise trackers....its a watch on steroids. I don't recommend showering or swimming with it and YOU MUST GET A HARD COVER (which it does not ship with, just like your phone)
"
Katelyn R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely love the watch itself but ended up shelling out another $50 in watch bands two days after delivery.  I have a VERY mild latex allergy that hasn’t really flared up since I was a teen- had a super cheap id205l smartwatch with the rubber band that I wore daily for a year with no problem so I didn’t think the Apple Watch band would be a problem.  Latex is NOT listed as an ingredient upon perusing apple’s website but is obviously somewhere in their band formula.  Aside from that- watch itself is easy to use and runs many of my favorite apps.  It will not get Facebook notifications for whatever reason- just messenger.  I’ve changed all my settings per the instructions online, no luck.  Well worth the investment but if you have a latex allergy skip this band.
"
Archer1134,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I decided to finally buy an Apple Watch and really enjoyed this model: The watch itself does everything I wanted at a good price point.,I went back and forth on purchasing a different band than the “sports band” that comes with this, but decided that the “sports band” would likely hold up better while running, biking, or doing whatever.,As it turns out, that mistake cost me what I paid for this watch: The sports band is horrible. The tiniest brush against the band where it’s clipped in causes it to release. I carry my laptop, kids, food, or whatever in that hand, and it always finds a way to unlatch.,Finally, I got to the point where I decided to ask for a new band for Christmas, and the very same day, for no reason other than holding a cutting board with the hand/wrist my watch was on, the clasp managed to unlatch yet again.,Despite being only perhaps a 4 foot drop to the laminate floor, the face shattered (as did my heart). The watch is, to its credit, still usable, but I can’t believe that’s all it took, and all because the standard band is of terrible quality.,If I ever bite the bullet and try the Apple Watch again, I will definitely be getting a different band with a true clasp and not the weak clasp these “sports” bands have.

L Boettcher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It seems almost silly to review an Apple Watch.  Everyone knows that Apple Watches are high quality.  The only decision is what model to buy.  The SE 2020 is basically between the 5 and 6 series.  It has many of the same functions as the 5 minus a few, and it has the better screen of the 6.  The price tag on the SE is more friendly than many of the other series.  This watch does not have all the bells and whistles as the 6 or 7, but it also does not have the price tag.

kitty betz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this product and it’s worth the investment. It’s low key life changing. Answering texts and calls without even having to get your phone. The Siri integration is great, so practical and useful. Hey Siri, what’s the definition of an ester? Hey Siri, what is John Locke known for? Hey Siri, how old is Bruce Springsteen? Hey Siri, call Jamie.,I’m also particularly fond of the hand washing detection: it’s surprisingly accurate and will stop counting and tell you to keep washing if you wash your hands for less than 20 seconds. Very handy (pun intended) feature during a deadly pandemic. I’m grateful for and also very impressed by the noise level measuring feature, as I have hearing loss so it is extra important for me to protect my ears. Good fitness, sleep, and heart rate tracking. Battery life is pretty good. I like how the band tucks in when you put it on instead of sticking out like some other smart watches do. All around a practical and beautiful product and wonderful features for the price :)

CP30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this for my fiance to replace her Garmin watch (which she loved) but this watch... she's crazy about! It does much more than her Garmin.  The Garmin isn't even close to this.  From reading many reviews before I bought her the SE, it was clear that this watch is the best value for the money.  The only thing I could see that this watch doesn't have compared to the latest Apple watches is the blood oxygen count monitor.  She doesn't need that anyway.  This watch has all the other features - GPS, reading texts including displaying photos!, answering calls and you can hear and talk into your watch (so you can leave you phone in you pocket or handbag!)  She loves this watch so I'm happy too.  Now she's talking about buying me one!
"
ema,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this watch to replace my Fitbit.  To be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this watch.  I am not a heavy phone user.  I only use my iPhone for google map, emails, and music.  So the apps on the watch is a total waste.  Of course, I cannot close them.  The activity app is not the easiest to use.  The worst thing about this watch is the battery life.  It only last one day.  I've tried to turn off the Bluetooth, but it turns on by itself.  Fitbit doesn't do a lot compared to this watch.  But if you only want to track your activity and sleep, it is a better option.  And the battery lasts one week.  Besides, it's much cheaper, too!

  Offered to get my gf one of these months and months back when she started her new job after graduating college. She declined as she thought it was to much money. Fast forward to to a few months down the road to her moms birthday, and she buys one for her. I am sure everyone can see where this is going, SURPRISE, my gf loves the watch she got her mom and won't stop talking about it. Her birthday was right around the corner so I snagged one for her and now she loves it.,Upside for me, my gf now has no excuse on missing a text or a call as it vibrates on her wrist. Overall, she is happy she got one, which means I am happy. I recommend it.

Aloe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this airpods pro today and I can't with to use my new airpods, but when I open and check the box, this airpod is made in Vietnam, I have read some people write the airpods made in Vietnam have quality issues, and I open to check it, I found the glue overflow at bonding position, you can see the yellow line, it is glue, and it have cut feel when you touch the body of this airpods, just don't buy is or you can make sure it isn't made in Vietnam!!!!
"
Diane G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These little things pack one hell of a punch!,Apple’s new noise cancellation and transparency modes lay the groundwork for a new generation of wireless headphones. Yes others may have used similar technology before, but Apple’s simplistic UI made for the airpods pro make the experience so much better than what other companies offer.,Coming from the first generation airpods, the experience is like night and day. Even though the airpods themselves are heavier, they feel lighter in the ears and much more comfortable. The audio quality is insane, and this quality is only amplified by Apple’s new spatial audio.,I definitely recommend these.
"
Jason E. Ballard,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are really nice earphones.  I've had mine for about a year and have enjoyed them from the start.  Once you find the right size of rubber inserts they stay in your ears better.  The Noise Canceling feature is really nice especially when it comes to trying to listening to music or a phone call with loud background noise.  I have also used these as hearing aids to listen to conversations when your friends are speaking low/whispering.
"

  Received these AirPods out the box, exactly as shown on pictures. Plastic Seal was completely compromised. Immediately knew something was up. CLEARLY FAKE AirPods they couldn’t even get the boxes to match correctly.  Just go straight to Apple avoid this hassle.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very fast, very capable, great screen.,Coming from a 3rd gen iPad Pro 12.9”, this is not as big of an improvement as I thought it would be.,Yes, this is faster but unless you’re a pro or gamer, you probably won’t notice a big difference from the chips a few years ago.,The picture, taken on my iPhone XS max, shows a comparison between the 3rd gen iPad Pro 12.9 from 2018  (right) and the new one (left). As you can see in the picture, the contrast ratio is much better on the new, 5th gen iPad Pro 12.9. It’s a little hard to capture on the iPhone but the colors and look of HDR content is excellent.,What Apple doesn’t tell you about is the bloom around text and controls on dark screens. It is not quite as bad as this picture makes it appear but it is still quite annoying. Personally, I find the lack of contrast in the older screen more annoying than the bloom in the new one, so I’ll stick with a new one.,The other thing that Apple doesn’t tell you is that this new iPad is heavier than the old one by about 50g. It’s not a dealbreaker but it is noticeable.,I would say this is definitely an improvement but had I known what I do now, I would’ve just kept my old one for another year or two.,I took off two stars because I mainly updated for the screen and Apple really wasn’t honest about light bloom levels. This is really an excellent device; I just don’t like false advertising and expected better.
"
Ian,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The 2021 iPad Pro 12.9"" with M1 is the premier tablet on the market. Smooth, fast, and beautiful.,Apple made a few changes to the 2021 iPad Pro 12.9"", most notably the inclusion of the M1 chip and the gorgeous XDR display. The M1 chip is a nice addition, but right now, it still feels like overkill. I switched to the M1 MacBook Pro in 2020 and the improvements were astounding. Those improvements don't really seem to have quite the same impact on the iPad, and that's mostly because it's still a victim to iPadOS. I don't imagine that Apple has any plans on allowing its iPads to run MacOS, due to cannibalization of the MacBook market, but iPadOS has its limitations. I do not think the iPad is ready to replace your laptop quite yet, but the power is there to do so. Apps do tend to pick back up where you left them off more quickly than in previous gens.,The XDR display, overall, is pretty gorgeous. Streaming movies, TV shows, YouTube, etc. is really something else. It is a pretty nice and noticeable upgrade over the previous gen. With that said, the XDR display does also suffer from some moderate blooming effects, most notably when you have a bright white image or text displaying against deep black background. It's not terrible, but it is something to be aware of.,The battery life is essentially identical to previous generations, and Apple reflects that in its specs. What additional battery life that might have been gained with the M1 chip was probably immediately sucked away with the inclusion of the XDR display. Battery life is totally fine, it's just not better.,Is it worth upgrading? If your iPad is at the end of its life or you just really, really want the top-of-the-line tablet on the market, sure, it's a great option. If you have a previous gen iPad Pro and you're perfectly happy with the quality of the display, it probably isn't worth upgrading. At least not until they bring MacOS to the iPad...

  Disappointed, I heard some people mentioning the XDR display had some blooming. In use it’s not acceptable. I have a iPhone 12 Pro Max and 2020 iPad Pro 12.9 for work and wanted to replace my MacBook Pro at home with another 12.9 iPad Pro, and. This display is junk, the chip is super snappy. Back to the drawing board Apple.

  I wish I would have listened to the other reviews regarding the bloom.  It's really noticeable.  Once you notice it, you will notice it everywhere.  Using the dark theme really brings it out.  I can't imagine who approved this at Apple.  The contrast ratios are lies.  Skip this generation or get the 11"".

  Sounds: 4.5/5 - loud and sounds good with minimum rattle. Not premium speakers though.,Screen: 3.5/5 - the blacks look great, the contrast is extremely wide, everything looks great, but there is a ton of backlight bleed for someone who notices that thing. Areas with a thick black section will have light bleeding over from the nearby lit areas. Picturs uploaded at different brightness intervals. It may not bother some people, I found that I can see it drawing or watching movies with the black background down to about 20%, but I have a keen eye for displays. Display is very bright so high brightness isn't always required anyway, may be an issue for some digital artists who use black backgrounds. It was a bit more noticeable than I was hoping.,Drawing quality with pencil 5/5 - keep in mind light bleed may be an issue for you with blacks backgrounds but other than that I like using this in Photoshop.,M1 chip is amazing, but this needs more testing.,Slightly thicker, but not noticably heavier.,I feel like the new magic keyboard tilts back further, I could be wrong but get that one if you scoop up this iPad.

  The tablet is good it’s faster than any tablet on the market and it shows the screen is nice and the battery life is basically all day. However I’ve noticed that with the new mini led display when leds are lit around leds that aren’t the light tends to bleed pretty noticeably.

  I’ve owned a lot of iPads - minis and regular iPads for the kids.  I had an iPad Pro second generation I originally bought to watch movies when I travel for work and to take notes. My wife took it over when she became obsessed with Procreate (a drawing application).  Over time the battery got worse and worse and the performance dropped. At one point she couldnt update the application anymore.,We bought the iPad Pro 5th generation as a pre release. Like all things Apple, you’re definitely paying a premium but for someone who is serious about their art of craft - worth it.,Pros:,+ the processing power is a BEAST. It’s effortless and smooth. The M1 makes a huge difference.,+ the camera is amazing and the depth sensor opens worlds of possibilities for immersive, but you’ll likely rarely use it,+ it’s an Apple so the resell value is great. This reduces the cost of ownership because when you upgrade in a few years you can still sell for a good amount.,Neutral (compared to the Gen2):,- the Mini LED feels a bit hyped. The screen in side by side comparisons wasn’t noticeably better in my opinion. If you’re not a professional who relies on nuanced color calibration, etc. you may not notice a difference. I am a photographer and don’t think most people will notice a difference.,- the form factor remains largely unchanged.  With a case it’s still a heavy machine relatively speaking.,Negatives,- price. I got the 256GB plus a case and a pencil. It’s a big chunk on money for most people. Most people should stick with an Air or regular iPad. Throw in the keyboard and some dongles and taxes and you’ve cleared two thousand pretty easily.,- the form factor is slightly thicker than Gen4 so while I got a case which fit, the Apple Pencil didn’t charge. So if you need pencil charging, get a Gen5 case.,- Apple really needs to just commit to one port type. This is lightning (USB C) which is great, but most apple products are still lightning. More of an annoyance, but make up your mind Apple!,- it’s almost a PC replacement but not quite there for most people.  Certain user types may be able yo replace their PC or Mac but I still see it as a secondary device.

  My other iPad was released in 2011.  It was a 32 bit iPad.  And it was time to get it replaced.  Although it still works very well, it is a bit SLOW.  And I am unable to upgrade the OS and add new apps.  So I purchased this one.  Purchasing this was a much easier and a faster experience than purchasing from Apple or the other national electronics store.  Amazon was excellent at keeping me updated and it shipped much quicker than I had expected.

  This is the 2nd iPad Pro I’ve bought from Amazon. Defective product sold, placed on charge after setting it up and screen was black. Called amazon spent over 1 hr 45 mins on phone getting run around. Told by amazon rep they can’t return it has to be apple. Apple say it has to be amazon since it’s sold by them. Still no resolution.  Save yourself the headache and buy directly from Apple

  This line of iPad Pro (12.9 - the mini led display ones) has an issue where the center of the screen will warp (distort - ? I don’t even know what to call it. It’s some kind of weird temporary indentation that appears but goes away when the iPad cools back down) when an intensive app (demanding games, massive downloads) causes the processor to heat up. If this will bother you DO NOT BUY. You have been warned. Don’t expect it to be an isolated issue. It is likely on all/most units. I know this because I have had replacements that do the same thing and did not fix the issue. I had two 128’s and one 256 gb model that did it and friends who had the issue too.,PLEASE WARN YOUR FRIENDS/call this review ‘helpful’ so that more people know about this and don’t get something with a problem. It’s very easy to not notice this and get stuck outside a return window. I bought from apple directly but decided to post here to warn people.,If you already have the device and are stuck with it, turning on “low power mode” blocks it from happening for me.,Edit: low power mode has stopped helping it unfortunately and the issue got worse. It happens when browsing some websites that make it heat up for some reason.,Proof in picture

Daniel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't understand why people feel the need to post their their non-verified purchase reviews(basically opinions) of new Apple products. But since I got mine today and all the reviews are from people who haven't even seen, let alone used the new 3rd gen AirPods, I will give my initial impressions.,These are the successor to the standard, 2nd gen AirPods released in the spring of 2019. These keep the open design without eartips, but adopted the look and control system of the AirPods Pro. These also get wireless charging by default (like the AirPods Pro), as well as MagSafe charging (something that the AirPods Pro were updated with after these were announced). I am an Apple fan, for sure, and I own all versions of the AirPods that are currently sold as well as the Beats Studio Buds. Some people think that these aren't worth $180 because the Pro model already exists and sells for $180-200 usually, even though the list price is $250.,These do not have the active noise cancellation feature that the AirPods Pro or Beats Studio Buds have, but I think people are forgetting that some people don't like using earbuds with tips that go into your ear canal. That is one of the the things that made AirPods so popular in the first place, plus the fact that they are made by Apple. There aren't a ton of options for premium, open true wireless earbuds with the universal fit that AirPods offer, they're just not as common as the kind with silicon eartips. And there is no way to use the AirPods Pro without also using the eartip, they won't stay in place like theses 3rd gen AirPods will.,The bud itself is larger on these compared to the previous model with the longer stems, so these feel a bit different when you put them in your ear. I got used to it pretty quickly and they are really comfortable, they stay in place really well for my ear shape. These have the force squeeze controls that the Pros have and it is so much better to use than the old tap controls. If you haven't used this controls system before, you will most likely enjoy using it more because the bud doesn't get pressed into your ear when you need to pause the music and you get more options for controlling playback.,The other big upgrade here is the sound quality along with Spatial Audio which works just as well as it does on the AirPods Pro. The sound quality now is pretty much on par with the AirPods Pro, some reviewers have even said it's better. It includes the Adaptive EQ feature where the earbuds are constantly re-adjusting the sound to give you the best quality audio based on your surroundings. There is an internal microphone dedicated just to analyzing the audio to make sure it sounds as good as possible.,Spatial Audio is kind of hard to explain but I will try my best, instead of having a static left and right channel audio, the audio sounds like it's all around you. For Video, it makes the sound seem like it's coming from where the video is playing (your iPhone or iPad or Apple TV). Think about if you are listening to audio from a speaker that is in front of you, if you turn your head to the left, your right ear is going to be hearing more of the audio because your left ear is now facing away from the speaker. That is what spatial audio is like, using the new AirPods when you watch a video on your iPhone. The AirPods use the sensors(accelerometers and gyroscopes) in the earbuds as well as in your iPhone to calculate the position of your head in reference to the device playing the video. The end result is that the audio sounds like it is in front of you, coming from the device, even though it’s playing through the AirPods. It really is awesome and it's one of my favorite features of these AirPods, the older 2nd generation did not include this feature but the Pro model does. While originally it only worked on iPhone/iPad, it now works on Mac and Apple TV as well.,The last thing to mention is these AirPods now have better sensors for detecting when they aren't in your ear, even the Pro model doesn't have the new skin detection sensors. This means that if you take out your earbuds and put them in your pocket or a dark place like a drawer, the AirPods will not be fooled and won't accidentally un-pause your music until you put them back in your ear. The old model used optical sensors that were good, but not this good.,Pros+,Wireless Charging+MagSafe charging comes standard (before you had to pay extra),Spatial Audio for watching videos and for supported songs through Apple Music,Open design that doesn't require the use of eartips you have to put in your ear canal,Much improved sound quality over the previous generation (AirPods 2),New force touch sensors like the AirPods Pro,Better in-ear detection thanks to skin detection sensors,Improved mic quality for voice calls, Apple is using a new codec for voice calls (AAC-ELD),Longer Battery Life (6 hours) [compared to 5 hours on Airpods 2 and 4.5 hours on AIrPods Pro],Better support from the Find My app, there is now a precision finding feature similar to AirTags and you can ring them while they are still in the case (only available on the new AirPods 3),Apple’s H1 chip and the strength of the ecosystem (Hey Siri, your messages and notifications will be announced to you, auto switching between devices signed into your iCloud account, audio sharing, etc). To be clear, these are not new or exclusive to AirPods 3, but still add to the value proposition.,Cons-,No Active Noise Cancellation because of the open design,The AIrPods Pro can sometimes be had for roughly the same price,Universal shape might not fit everyone’s ears,Not as compelling for people with Android phones and Windows computers. Apple’s OS and software is what makes these so magical
"
Scora,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm comparing these to the AirPods Pro. These are excellent for those who want to save a few bucks and don't need the active noise cancelation. They're everything the AirPods 1 and 2 are, it better and more compact!,Sound - Warm and balanced. There's bass! These sound great for earbuds with no silicone or foam ear tips. It's very hard to get excellent sound quality without a seal in the ear and Apple has figured it out with these AirPods! Clarity isn't amazing, but that's a good thing because instead of boosting the treble to create fake clarity and ruin the sound, apple played the strengths of their driver and created a flat tonal curve. Makes listening to songs very enjoyable and not harsh nor muddy.,Fit - Super lightweight! They'll stay in your ears. They're so much lighter than the AirPods Pros. I was genuinely surprised when I pulled it out of the case. This is a good thing! One gripe about the AirPods Pro was its slightly heavy and has ear tips which plug into your ear canals. These don't. That means they'll just disappear in your ears and you'll definitly forget it's there. Wait, I'm wearing something?? Currently listening to music on these while writing this review.,Style - Honestly, AirPods 3 and Pro look the best in the market. Other earbuds look like a huge round hearing aid sticking out of you ear. With the shorter stem on these, it'll be a huge upgrade to the previous Gen AirPods. No more silly long white stem sticking out of the ear, it looked hideous in my opinion for people who don't know that the stem is supposed to point directly down and / or towards your mouth, NOT pointing slightly away from you.,And NO, I'm not an apple fan boy. I use a fully custom built PC and have been rocking android for all my life. Apple just makes incomparable products and earbuds just happen to be one of them.

  Bought these to upgrade from the 2nd gen never got the pros because I personally don’t like in ear buds, but the sound quality is definitely better than the 2nd gen with much better bass and touch controls work way better then the tap function. Also to view your warranty go to your settings on your iphone then bluetooth then select info on your new air pods and scroll all the way to the bottom to see your warranty. In all this was a great purchase and definitely enjoying all the features on these

  First of all they’re huge and can’t even fit that good in my ear and second of all they hurt so bad I can’t even listen to music for more than ten minutes without me having to take them out and massage my ears. what a disappointment.

Matthew,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are a step up from the Airpods 2, the new drivers bring out more bass, for me these are a win, I am still waiting for my pair to be delivered from Amazon (should be here today) but couldn’t wait so I bought another pair in store, I cannot use in ear headphones with rubber tips cause they slip out, I’ve tried jabras, Samsung, seinheiser etc, all start slipping with in 20 minutes and I have to push back in, With these Airpods I can run and workout and they stay in, These are the best fit so far, sound quality is also a step up, I highly recommend over the pros even though you don’t get noise canceling
"
Jake,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The first airpods were better. I haven’t owned the AirPods Pro. Probably will never own them after buying these. None of the controls work as they should. You can “pinch” all the times you want and they will not recognize anything. What a waste of money. I had to turn the volume all the way up and they are barely loud. Huge disappointment.

  Eh is all I can say. Honestly, I had high expectations about these new AirPods. As a airpods lover. There is no difference the 1st and this one, only thing is the size of the headphone that go in your ears. Don’t upgrade. Stick with the OG airpods, way better. Thinking of returning.

"
Dustin Wood,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am one who has a hard time finding buds that stay in my ears. To my surprise, a few years ago, I found out that the wired designed ear buds actually fit and stayed in my ears. After that, I went and bought the first Airpods. Now, they're what, 4-5 years old? and I've been looking for their next gen ones for over a year. I was excited that they finally released them, but was hesitant on the design. I ordered them anyways.,To my disappointment, they do not stay in my ears like the original design. They fall right out. So if you have odd ears like me, and found that the original design has been the best fitting earbuds you've also found, you will not like this updated design. So sad that they've updated it. Which probably means now, as time goes on, I'll have to resort to actual headphones, because I've yet to have found any silicon tips that stay in my ears either. Even found a third party that makes smaller ones. And one that make the foam ones. Nothing works for me.,Hopefully, they'll be enough people out there like me that force Apple to go back to their original design.,EDIT: Replying to the current top liked comment bellyaching why people are leaving unverified reviews. It's because Apple doesn't allow reviews, and people have to know that these do not fit the same. It's up to the user to make the decision on if they want to buy or not.

Kutlay Alan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I just opened the sealed box and found out the left AirPod was manufactured misaligned causing pain and discomfort due to exposed uneven, sharp edges that scratch and hurt inside of my ear. I can’t believe Apple’s QC missed this. I will have to deal with another fun return/exchange experience and hope the replacement won’t have the same issue.

Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Lets start from what everyone wants to know first.,Pros:,1.  Holy mother goose, the sound quality is like nothing i have ever heard, it’s Fantastic, Surround sound with everything it connects to,2. The build quality is far superior to every headset i have ever used. I have had BOSE, JaBra, Sony, and this headset blows them away. IT is all metal save the ear cups and head band thingy. The headset is made out of a single carved out air craft aluminum .,3. COMFORTABLE , i wore these for 7 hours straight and never had any issues of being too tight, and despite what other reviewers have said, they dont feel heavy on my head at all. Nor does it heat up around your ears.,3. Battery life. I have not charged them yet and after 20 hours I still dont have to charge them, they are at 30%,4. The controls are perfect. Rather than mess with the touch type , the volume is a small well placed knob on the right that adjust the sound volume and pause and other functions i still haven’t explored.,5. Noise Cancellation, OMG, you wouldn’t believe the sound quality of noise cancellation, I went to the flight line at the army base near me, (yes I’m a vet) and was by one of the blackhawks talking to my friend. They started up the Blackhawk, and i called someone and they couldn’t hear it at all. You can hear you own voice like normal rather than the muffled sound you usually get with Bluetooth and noice cancelation, A ++++++,6. Connection. Everyone of my apple devices automatically paired with out me even prompting. It was completely seamless. I can with between my Mac Mini, IPhone 11, and iPad with no problems. In fact i can connect to any device and go a lot further than that standard 30 ft. I have a quarter acre and i can go anywhere around my house and not lose the signal,CONS: Oh boy here we go,1. The case is stupid, when i say stupid it looks like your carrying a purse around, IT DOES NOT protect the headset. There are cases on amazon made for the IPod Max, that will put it to sleep when you put them in.,There is no way to turn them off at all. When you leave them out they go into low power mode after 15 minutes. Or you can put them in the case it came with and they go to sleep.,2; No brick, for $550 you would think they would include a charging brick but all they give you is a Lighting cable that does NOT have a standard usb connection on one end.,The cons are few and mostly just trivial things and certainly not a deal breaker. These headphones are so amazing its worth every penny and would last you.a lifetime.,I see reviews complaining about the weight. Really? These things are NOT that heavy, In fact every expensive head phones ive used make your ears sweat, they flake, and always feels tight.,YOu dont even notice these headphones after awhile.,I realize they are expensive but you get what you pay for. And in this case you are getting probably the best headphones you could ever imagine that will not fall apart, feel uncomfortable and give you an amazing sound quality in all areas.,No , I’m not paid for this, no, i am not biased about Apple these simply blow away all the other super expensive headphones
"
Chandra,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These headphones are in a weight class of their own. Now, it might seem like these are supposed to be direct competitors with the Bose QC 35/700s or the Sony XM4s, but these are truly a step up from those headphones in every respect.,The first thing to consider is the materials used in the headphone. There are not many all metal construction headphones on the market and these use a solid block of aluminum that get machined into the cups on both sides, classical Apple over-engineering on the telescoping arms, and a truly comfortable mesh net that distributes the weight elegantly on your head.,The headphones benefit from active noise cancellation which immediately improves sound quality because we have an increase in insolation. The drivers in these headphones may not be cutting edge or in line with headphones in this price bracket (they are dynamic, not planar or electrostatic), but they benefit _heavily_ from Apple's active tuning via DSP. The HomePod was frequently praised for its sound quality largely because of the DSP that Apple had achieved to bring out the most performance from the device. In the same vein, the AirPods Max achieve great sound, far surpassing the Bose and the Sonys, with the added benefit of DSP.,There are some slight design decisions that are annoying. The case is cumbersome and non-protective and the headphones do not power off on their own for a while. These are things that Apple can change via Software Update so I imagine that will be addressed in future iterations.,But what really separates these headphones from the $300 bracket and headphones that sell for $400-600 is that they are brilliant bluetooth headphones. They sound better than the $300 market and offer features that are _nowhere_ to be seen in the mid-range audiophile market, namely ANC and active DSP. These are inherent to bluetooth headphones because there is a DAC/AMP stage in the AirPods Max themselves, but are the reason they cannot be easily compared.,Overall, if you have the money and value good sound quality, these are an easy buy. Personally, my life style does not lend super well to the AirPods Max current design but I imagine future iterations will fix those issues.

M. Cordoba,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Summary: TLDR;,Love the sound, great comfort on top of head (but a little tight on the side of the head around the ears), awesome for movies (spatial audio is awesome) and music. Excellent ANC. Connection from phone to iPad and back is perfect. However there is water buildup after 3-4 hours underneath the earcups - repeatable when just sitting at my desk at 66-70 degrees. Connection to a MacBook Pro and back to phone is just not as seamless, and it gets lost sometimes. I returned them but tested them extensively for 3 weeks, really wanted to keep them but the water flaw is too concerning at this price to risk it.,Detailed Review:,I’m going to start with the good:,- spatial audio is really good. Watching the Mandelorian is great - more for the surround sound experience than the more gimmicky thing with turning your head - which is “cool” but adds little to no value. Whereas surround sound - experiencing noises from different sides really helps with the immersion.,- sound quality is excellent for Bluetooth headphones. I preferred these instead of the XM4. I am not an audiophile but I like good sound and these seemed more balanced. I have $200 wired seinheiser headphones that I might like a tiny bit better for music for what it’s worth.,-  construction build quality is definitely a step up from competitors.,- connecting to iOS devices is excellent and to a MacBook Pro is good - but not great. More on that later.,- ANC really good equal pretty much to XM4. I think xm4 is slightly better at some things and these are better cancelling other noises. Overall excellent,- headband / top of head very comfortable. Much more so than the xm4.,Neutral:,- lots of people made a big deal about no power off button and talk about it just “draining battery” unless you put it in the case. I tested this a lot, and it seems Apple is accurate when they say it goes to low power mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. Losing about 1% every couple of hours. Essentially losing 5% when left without a case overnight. I’m talking 5-6pm to 8am. However I had an issue where they wouldn’t turn on (only 1 day) with a full battery. Since there is no power button... I removed them form my ears out then back on, I stuffed them in the “smart case” removed them, nothing. I plugged them to the lightning cable to see if the charge light would turn on, and then they immediately started working (battery read 109%, I only plugged them in for 5 seconds). It only happened one day out of 20... but annoying nonetheless.,- ear pad material is soft but course so moving it side to side hurts my ears. But leaving then on (normal use case) is comfortable.,Cons:,- the “case”. It has a nice material but it doesn’t provide any protection for them at all. Fairly pointless and you can see all the jokes online about it. I don’t think it looks bad, it’s just pointless without any protection. Going to ultra low power mode a day sooner (it still takes like 15 hours or something, not sure why it’s not instant to that power mode).,- the price. Just a tad too high to swallow, but I had returned the XM4 for various small annoyances to splurged on this hoping it solved the issues - it mostly does but the last 2 points made me return them:,- connecting to MacBook Pro and iPhone “automatic switching”. I was hoping this would be better than the XM4 (which constantly got stuck on the wrong device and had no way other than turning off Bluetooth to send it back to the laptop). It is better, but it’s not perfect. It’s perfect between iOS devices - going back and forth from phone to iPad is seamless and pretty amazing - much better than anything out there. However once a MacBook is involved it’s a different deal. There is a little prompt at the top right that shows up that you need to click when switching back and forth, but it no always shows up. Sometimes it does, sometimes it switches automatically and sometimes I need to connect the headphones to the MacBook again. I’m still not sure when it does which of them. However removing them from my ears and putting them back on resets it and I’m connected to the MacBook or the prompt shows up for me to click. Overall I’m not sure why they couldn’t make it as seamless as iOS where just clicking pause on one and play on them other switches the connection immediately: there is no awkward prompt or anything. Overall I was disappointed on the instant switching when involving my MacBook Pro. Still works better than the xm4 and Bose 700 that sometimes gets lost in between with no easy reset.,Finally why I returned them - you can see the pictures I attached. I wanted these as primary work headphones (conference calls - which they work great, ANC which works great, easy switching which works very good but not great, and for music and movies which they are excellent).,However the stories online I thought maybe affected few people. The first day I didn’t have any buildup, nor the second or the third. However today after a 4 hour session, I checked and there was enough for me to not be comfortable that these expensive headphones would last the 10 years I was hoping they would.,If it weren’t for the water buildup I would probably keep them, they are that good, but this is a deal breaker since Apple does not cover water damage as part of warranty.,I was simply sitting in my desk, half basement. I didn’t walk or exercise or anything. Temperature was 66 degrees Fahrenheit so fairly cool. The theory online is the metal acts as a heat sink in comparison to the warmth between your ears and earcup area.,Update: I have been able to consistently (daily) repressive the condensation issue. It was not a one time thing. After 3-4 hours every day I get to wipe the inside because there is water. Yeah I returned them.,Anyway I’m not gonna risk holding an expensive paperweight. Too bad because they are great headphones with a fatal flaw.,I contacted Apple and the just said: “we are aware of the claims and are looking into them”. They are not just claims they are very much real. And you don’t have to wear them for 20 hours - this was only 4 hours.,If you have a question feel free to ask. I’ve tested these and the xm4s fairly extensively.

James,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I enjoy the sound quality and the actual quality of these headphones, but after watching YouTube my expectations were way higher than what I saw. After opening the box I noticed the laughable case that most have pointed out, but my main issue is the lack of comfort. I came from Bose QC35s and they feel like a feather on your head, while these sqeeze the top of your head and made me have a headache after only 30 minuets of use. I think if you are looking to spend money on a good set of headphones go Bose or Sony, as these don't live up to what YouTube says as they sound about the same as my bose unless the volume is at 100%, which I never use.
"
Garp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Yes, there are probably headphones that give yo better bang for your buck, and I'm no audiophile, but the noise cancellation is as good if not better than my Sony XM3's and these sound better balanced with a more natural, less bass heavy sound to them. They aren't easy to recommend given the price tag, they'd be an easier sell at the $400-$450 range, but I'm glad I bought them and will be selling my Sony's and using these as my daily drivers.

Brian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Noise cancellation absolutely top tier. I didn’t find weight to be an issue as I mostly listen using over ears sitting down and don’t move around a ton. Range for Bluetooth is decent can walk all over my home.,Very comfortable and music quality is superb for Bluetooth/wireless since I listen to Spotify it is the best quality you’ll get out of wireless in my opinion.,The transparency mode is pretty darn good but if your music is too loud you may still have issues hearing others talk of course.,Price is absurdly high but that’s apple for you. But they are exactly what they advertised. Quality built product, sound, noise cancel, comfort. But you will benefit most if you already use some apple products like an iphone otherwise if you don’t just get the Sony MX4’s which are the closest comparable noise canceling earphones you’ll get.,I don’t regret spending as I’ve been using them nonstop, never have to turn volume all the way up as it gets plenty loud at 75-80% and battery lasts an extremely long time.

But this watch is quite a challenge.,When I tried to pair the watch to the phone, the phone said I must update the phone to OS 14.8.1.  Yet I have always had ""automatic updates"" ""on"" in the phone menu.,So I spent a half-hour updating to OS 14.8.1.,I tried to pair the watch to the phone again and the phone said my OS must be updated.  But I had just updated it.  So I called apple support.  They directed me to update my OS to 15.1.  Why was I previously directed to update to 14.8.1 when that was obsolete?  Updating to 15.1 took an hour!,Next when I tried to pair the watch, the message on the phone says that I need to charge the watch.  I examined the watch charge cable and it must plug into a USB ""C"" charger which is not included with the watch.  Do you have such a charger?  I didn't even know such chargers existed.  I have ten chargers, including several made by apple, and they all only accept the original USB plug, called USB ""A"".,I recall reading a few weeks ago that apple was no longer including chargers.  I thought, that's ok, we all have lots of chargers.  But nobody has USB ""C"" chargers, they are very new.,So I ordered a USB ""C"" charger.,The charger arrived I started the pairing process.  But the phone stuck for 30 minutes during the pairing process so I called support.  They couldn't get it to work by the standard way, which is to update the watch software, so they opted to install without updating the watch software.  That worked with lots of hand holding and took about 45 minutes,All together I spent about six hours getting the phone to work.,Has apple lost their mind?

  The Apple Watch 7 is nice. Especially if you are upgrading from a version that is several years old.,But beware, it only comes with a charger that is USB C. So if you don’t already have a usb power brick or old Watch charger, you have to buy that and won’t be able to charge your watch

  If I knew that they were going to make all their chargers USB-C and not provide any blocks for no reason other than to force people to spend more money, I wouldn’t have bought it.

  This is my first Apple Watch. I feel incredibly stupid for waiting this long to buy one! This thing is SO amazing! I decided to go with the Graphite Stainless case. It’s certainly more expensive than the aluminum models which are also super nice. The watch is very easy to setup and connects nearly instantly to your IPhone. The apps and available customizable watch faces are nearly limitless. The 45mm fits my wrist perfectly - it’s not too big. It looks amazing! Make sure to order a USB C charger when you order your watch. I’m not sure why it’s not included. Other than that it’s perfect!! Absolutely love it. Probably one of the best little things I’ve ever bought for me!

  So far. Got the watch. Turned it on. When it tried to link to my Iphone it said I needed to update my Iphone. So I updated my Iphone which took hours. By that time the watch had run out of the factory charge. Dead watch. They give you a magnetic charger which has a USB C male end which fits nothing I have. Seriously! I paid over $700 for this thing and they couldn't include a real charger?  So, at this point it sucks.

  I’m upgrading from a series 1, so it is a completely different watch. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Most of the heart monitoring functions only work with people older than 22 which is frustrating for me especially since I paid for the watch, so I should get access to all the features. Nonetheless, I really like the starlight Apple Watch and band. It’s very subtle and nice to look at. Hopefully braided solo loops get a sale soon bc I really would like one. It is a pain that they don't give power bricks, but this is the new age. I highly suggest you purchase many usb c power bricks and switch all cords from usb a to usb c. Anker has great ones and you can always find deals for them.

  the magnet on the armband is too weak. the armband keeps slipping loose and ends up dangling on my arm every 20 minutes. and this is just while walking around the home or office. this band is absolutely unusable when exercising. the watch slips right off. i paid about $300 extra for a pretty armband, and it turned out to be a complete turd. i will be returning it and getting one of the base models

  Went outside and the screen is just absolutely stunning! It's super-blitzing speed and the camera is a game-changer! I'm coming off an XS MAX, and my XS is in perfect condition (91% battery maximum capacity) and amazing after 3 years. I was very hesitant and skeptical about how much better the 13 could be. I thought the only difference with the 13 would be better battery life and a better camera. I was wrong. The more vibrant colors and the brightness during the daytime are very noticeable and so good that it brings me such joy. The camera is unbelievable, there is almost no delay. After taking a blurry photo, it automatically starts editing/selecting and produces a completely focused photo. 13 is so much faster, it gives me an advantage and makes a notable difference in my work. I knew technically 13 would be better but I had no idea how much I would actually notice everything. Completely stunned!,11 PRO MAX/XS MAX,If you don't need the blazing speed or the amazing camera, I would recommend the 11 Pro Max, which has a better battery and better camera than the XS. XS MAX is still excellent if you find the right price. Both can be replaced with new batteries from Apple for only $69!

  The watch comes with a charger that takes a different kind of plug in instead of the standard USB plug in, now I have either order an aftermarket charging cable or a new charging block, I guess this is a petty way of apple trying to pick your wallet. So if anyone buys one of these watch's you may want to make sure that you have the new block or an after market USB charging cable, this set us back on the Christmas present until we can get something to charge the watch with.
"

  I have been happy with my purchase other than the fact that it came with a USB-C charging cable. Along with that, there is no power connector so if you don't have a USB-C charging port you won’t be able to charge the watch. If you decide to buy this watch, I recommend also purchasing a USB-C to USB connector so you can charge your watch. Apple, if you're reading this, please start including a proper charger with your apple watches. Thanks!

  What the heck!  After receiving my watch and realizing this cord isnt USB and I have no way of charging it I start asking around and googling I finally determine this is a  a USB-C connector( I had to do research to figure out what the heck this was even called) and now I have to spend more money to be able to charge this darn thing when the watch isn't cheap in the first place. Frustrating to say the least. I bought the SE model if that makes a difference. I went back into the listing and the packaging and no where does it say this comes with USB-C charging capabilities.....the package does say after looking, and in very small print ""power adapter sold seperately"".

  I love this product but.....,Battery life could be better.  I was a Samsung phone and watch user for years.  I switched to the Apple system and have been very happy.  My only disappointment so far has been battery life.  I can't use the watch for sleep tracking because it doesn't last longer than a day.  If I were to wear the watch all night I would have to charge it first thing in the morning.  Unfortunately, I work out first thing in the morning and use the watch for tracking my workout information.  Wish this had the same battery life as my Samsung.  I can wear that for several days without it going dead.

  My son wanted an apple watch, so we did a ton of research and picked one that said it was compatible with  ""iphone"" and ""watch ios,"" which indicates to us that it would work with his device. Unfortunately after all of the waiting (it arrived earlier than we expected, which was great, but he did need to wait a couple weeks)...the watch is only compatible with ios13 and above. False advertising. While we know his iPhone 6 is outdated, we wouldn't have bought this if we knew it wouldn't be compatible with ios 12.5.5. We have a frustrated, disappointed young man on our hands. Now we are trying to figure out how to fix it so he doesn't just end up with Amazon credit. 🙄

  If you are buying an Apple Watch, you should know it does not come with a power adapter. You need to buy a USB-C adapter. I have other Apple products and thought my existing adapters would work. Wrong. I used my Apple Watch for a day and went to charge it and found out I couldn't because I didn't have the Type C adapter. It had to sit unused until I could order one. Why a company worth Three Trillion Dollars can't include this $15 adapter is beyond my comprehension.,The one day I was able to use the watch It seemed like it will be a nice product for me. I look forward to being able to use it for more than a day.

  I’m thrilled. I love the fact there’s multiple ear tips and the small ones fit my ears great. Thrilled with the noise canceling feature while I stare at a family member yapping loudly on the phone and I don’t have to crank my volume up to drown them out. The controls are easy. It pauses music when I take an earbud out, so I’m not fumbling to pause and then yanking an earbud out while yelling “what”? I’ve never spent this much on headphones but these are worth the sub $200 I paid.,And if authenticity is a concern, get on the Apple site and enter the serial number because I assure you these are real and it takes 10 seconds to confirm.

  I've been too cheap to pay $250 for what look like just fancy earbuds. But, a combination of an Amazon sale for $189, and the most recent update that includes a Conversation Boost feature that allows AirPods Pros to function as hearing aid-type devices, convinced me to spring for AirPods Pros. I've only had them for a day, and I am so impressed! The silicone ear-tips are so much more comfortable than the hard plastic that is typical of non-pro AirPods and some other earbuds. They also come in 3 sizes so you can figure out which size is the most comfortable and provides the best seal in your ear. If you get the right size, the noise-canceling is effective! This has solved one of our marital problems, where I want to have a phone conversation while my spouse watches TV. The sound-canceling is so good, I can have a serious conversation with someone who doesn't even realize that there's a TV on in the same room.,At the same time, with a flick of a software button, you can switch to 'transparency', which allows you to hear what is going on around you. Even better, you can select the Conversation Boost option which turns the AirPods into respectable hearing aids. Even better than my actual hearing aids, the microphones in the AirPods are set up to mostly amplify the sound coming from whoever is in front of you. This works so well in not including peripheral conversations, which is a problem for those of us who no longer have great hearing. All I have to do is turn my head, and the person I'm now facing is having their voice amplified.,The sound quality is also very good; better than any other earbud-style earphones I've ever tried, and rivaling over-ear headphones that cost twice as much.,There are also so many options to customize the sound, amplification, source selection, and all sorts of other items that I haven't even explored yet. Another thing that kept me from buying these earlier was the fear that I would lose these expensive earbuds. But, there is also a nice, 'find my AirPods' feature that looks like it will really work. Hopefully, I'll never avail myself of this feature.,Finally, these earbuds are so popular, there are countless accessories available. I bought an inexpensive silicone case cover that fits really well and looks great. I also just bought some memory foam eartips that I think might be even more comfortable than the Apple silicone versions.,I see some gripes from other reviewers, particular regarding the lack of a charger included with these earbuds. Really, how many USB-Lightning chargers does the typical Apple product user need? I'm pretty sure that my wife and I have at least a dozen from our old/current phones, iPods(!) and iPads.

  Received today. One bud had scratches and scuffs. Doesn't look new at all. I've returned for an exchange and will update my review when I get a new NEW pair.,UPDATE: Amazon shipped a replacement next day. This pair appears better, but still not the pristine quality I’m used to from Apple. Made in Vietnam. Sound quality is good and noise cancellation works well. The only thing I miss is physical volume control on the buds. Paired quickly with my iPhone but took longer to pair with my MacBook Pro.

Earthling,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Never owned AirPods before. I bought the AirPods 3 first. They sounded great, better than I thought they would, but unfortunately, one side fit and one side didn't because my ears are different sizes internally. Then I bought these AirPods Pro. They fit great with the medium ear tips. The first day, it was hard getting use to them. After a few days they are feeling much better and I can walk around with them for hours in transparency mode. Battery life is ok..wish the buds and case had a few more hours like the new AirPods 3. I feel like the sound is pretty good for earbuds, closer to neutral than colored with music. In general, music sounds good, above average. For me, these shine with movies..they sound really good in spatial audio, theater-like. The noise cancelling works for my needs. Transparency mode and spatial audio are amazing, easily my favorite features of the AirPods Pro along with the H1 chip. I love that I can pickup any one of my apple products and have my AirPods connect instantly without me having to do anything.,My only complaints are two. I wish there were more colors...black, gray, etc..its about time. And the build quality isn't the best I have seen out of Apple. The seams on the AirPods are uneven and protruding in areas, and the charging case lid is loose..it moves side to side by less than half a millimeter, but it makes a clicking sound every time I touch the case. A quick web searched and I found this is an inherent issue with most AirPods Pro cases. I'm surprised Apple is ok with this.

  Haven't had these for a whole week and the right one is defective and doesn't charge/connect properly in charging case.

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A lot of people are saying “these don’t fit” or “these fit great” so I thought I’d shed some light. From most pictures online the gen 3’s seem like they would be similar to gen 1’s, perhaps a little deeper in the ear canal. The issue is the shear girth. In my top-down pic you can see these are a lot thicker than the gen 1’s. Both models are definitely shaped in a way that makes them compatible with most ear sizes, but personally, the gen 1’s sat in my ear a lot more comfortably, and I think I have bigger than average ear holes. You really have to find the right angle in your ear. The snugger fit on the gen 3’s may contribute to noise cancellation though. Gen 3’s blow gen 1’s out of the water in terms of sound quality.

  I love my apple products. But, sadly, this was a bit of a disappointment. I have small ears and struggle finding earbuds that will stay in my ears without me consistently having to push them in. Unfortunately, that was the case with these earbuds. They kept slipping out of my ears, especially during workouts, and I had to re-adjust consistently. However, the new features of these AirPods are great! I loved the voice recognition from Siri, the message alerts/calls (really neat for working out), and the more functions (like skipping songs or going back). The force motion was a miss for me because you have to grab onto the stem piece and because they would fall out, I just ended up taking the whole AirPods out. Overall, I am saddened to have to return them, they are just too expensive to be struggling so much. If you have small ears/ear canals I recommend thinking it twice before spending your money.
"
Bailey Hoffman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The new shape is awful - they barely fit in my ears now. They don’t feel well seated and feel like they could fall out at any minute. The sound quality is fine, but I hate the way they feel in my ear. I'll be returning them.
"
Brendon Elliott,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased the airpod pro to compare since the sale makes them nearly identical in price.,Build wise they are the same in that they both cause bit of discomfort in comparison to the og airpods with the airpod 3 and pro taking up more space in your ears. As an audiophile I judge more on sound, I’ve also used far more uncomfortable earbuds/iems in the past. I simply wanted to confirm the discomfort people were reporting, hopefully my ears adjust.,In terms of sound, they aren’t worth $179, I’d say it’s worth more like $50 in wired headphone world, but I guess that’s common knowledge for airpods at present. What’s interesting is that the new driver for the Airpods 3 handles sub-bass better than the airpod pro for acoustic music.,In the Airpod pro the bass would become so bloated you couldnt even hear the pitches, only a rumble. Here with the Airpod 3 it goes the opposite route, it puts up a white flag and gives you the pitch instead of the rumble if it goes too low. As a musician this is incredibly appreciated, and helps me enjoy the music (mostly acoustic) more. I have mixed feelings about the pro when it smears bass all over the quite detailed mid and treble.,The overall tuning of the 3 is much less serious than the airpod pro. Things in the foreground are trying to catch your ear and doing a dang good job at it. Background sounds get lost and complicated passages with multiple instrument/voices are unintelligible tbh. But, when things are simple these are a pretty good time :).,I would agree with the sentiment online that these are somewhat v shaped where the airpod pros are neutral with a bass boost (that seems to be a stand in for a lackluster driver).,I mainly want to use my airpods for voice calls so i will probably be keeping the 3s but the audiophile in me might finally spring for the Sony’s.,For being able to provide an experience much different than the pros and in some ways better, I give these a 4/5.,Spatial audio is great with acoustic music as well, don’t listen to the stick in the mud reviews. It’s more than a gimmick, it’s very enjoyable and I cant imagine how much better it could be in 5-10 years.,hopefully the pros of 2022 will incorporate this new driver for the ultimate airpod experience.,————————————,UPDATE,I’ve had these for about a week now and the discomfort is mostly gone, however now I’m getting Marques Brownlee issue with only the right earbud falling out of my ear after about half an hour or more of use. Very bizarre, for this reason I have to rate them 2/5 stars as opposed to 4/5.,Originally i did not hold ergonomics accountable to my score, but this is the first ear phone to fall out of my ear when I’m just sitting in a chair..
"

  These are not an upgrade. It is a cheaper version of AirPods Pro without silicone tips. They do not fit and fell off after some time.  The controls almost impossible to use: you can't just tap, now they have a button on a stem and you will accidentally pull it out of your ear every time when you are squeeze the button and moving at same time.,Returning.,BTW Amazon Prime users: Amazon will charge you $7 if you decided to return these worst Apple's AirPods of all time.

Corn,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  EDIT: These have been producing an audible “hissing noise” when in use with no audio or low volume. Software and firmware updates have not fixed the issue.,I purchased these as a replacement for my AirPods 1st Gen, which have been my daily drivers since early 2018.,The overall quality of the 3rd gen are a huge step-up compared to my old ones. They are noticeably louder and include new features such as spatial audio.,The only complaint I have so far, is how they fit my ears. The 3rd gen AirPods feel as if they will fall out of my ears easily. The shape is quite different than my old AirPods. The only reason I purchased these, was because they lacked the rubber ear-tips of the Pros, which I greatly disliked.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I just received my Airpods 3 and I'm sharing this view as an initial thought.,I'm writing this after returning 2 Airpods Pros to Best Buy. The sound on the Pro was too flat for my liking. After tweaking with the audio settings on my phone to no improvement, I returned the first pair thinking it was a hardware issue. Best Buy gave me a second pair which, after trying, wasn't different from the first. I sent it back expecting to exchange for Airpods 3, but that branch of Best Buy in my city did not have Airpods 3 available so I resorted to Amazon where there was a generous discount due to Black Friday.,Now, all  I can say is that if you're looking for quality sound choose the Airpods 3 over the Pro. This is because, although the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on the Pro gives you some quiet in noisy places, it compromises with the fidelity of the sound. After using it for sometime, the Pro sounds like some cheap earphones. The Airpods 3 has much more pronounced bass without sacrificing the high sounds.  Besides all this, it has all the features of the Pro, including Spatial Audio, save ANC and Transparency. On the 3, you'll enjoy natural transparency  and you wouldn't miss the ANC as other airpods give you better ANC.,Other advantages that you will enjoy in the 3 over the Pro is its lighter weight plus 6 hours of uninterrupted listening which is such a boon if you're the type that keeps your Airpods in your ears for longer hours. The charging case also offers you about 30 hours of juice which means you can charge your Airpods up to five times before needing to charge the case. Did I add that the 3 is water resistant including its case and that it has skin detection feature which will not play your music in case you leave the Airpods in your pocket? To me, the 3 is a slight upgrade of the Pro and the previous generations of Airpods.

  The 12.9 inch iPad Pros have a mechanical design problem that will eventually lead to inability to charge the iPad.  This is my second 12.9 inch iPad Pro.  The previous one had the same problem.  The USB-C charging port is not sufficiently secure.  It has lateral play that eventually causes an internal connection to break rendering the iPad useless requiring an expensive repair.  The internal connection may be a solder joint or a thin buss on a flexible printed circuit board.  I don’t know the actual design, but some connection will eventually break.  My first iPad was a 3rd generation iPad.  I assumed the lateral play in the USB-C was normal since it was the first iPad Pro to use that type of connector.  After a couple of years, it failed and Apple wanted $700 just to open it to see what was wrong.  Instead of paying for the repair, I purchased an 11-inch iPad Pro.  The cost was about the same.  The 11-inch does not have the lateral play issue.  The USB-C connector is very solid with absolutely no movement.  I really missed having a 12.9-inch for my digital art so I ordered this 2021 model, hoping that Apple fixed the problem.  As soon as it arrived, I checked the connection.  Sure enough, it has the same connector play as my original 12,9-inch.  I immediately repackaged it and will return tomorrow for a full refund.  Sadly, I recommend you stay away from 12.9-inch iPads until Apple corrects this flaw.

  I haven't owned any Apple product in like 10 years so was hoping to enjoy that quick & easy onboarding experience that people rave about.,Instead my iPad asked for ancient passwords and expired credit card numbers to log into my Apple ID. Obviously I didn't have that info, so I requested a password reset. It took their robot 24 hrs to ""review"" my request.... and then I got an email saying it'll take 2 weeks to reset?! 2 WEEKS?!,Until then I'm staring at a +$1k brick...

  I bought this iPad to replace my Microsoft Surface Pro, which I was never completely satisfied with. I had never owned an Apple device before, so there was a slight learning curve to get used to the non-Windows commands and functions. The screen is extremely sensitive, so I had to learn to lighten my touch quite a bit. Email was a snap to set up. It took me about 24 hours to download all the apps that I needed. I was able to transfer my photos and certain other files from my android phone. One weird thing I learned, you can't text non Apple devices. That seems unnecessarily exclusive. You need to pair the iPad with an iPhone in order to text Android devices, so if your phone is an Android you are SOL. There is an app available that let's you text android devices, but it assigns a whole different telephone number, so that is very confusing to the person receiving the text. Another weird thing is that the iPad does not have a headphone jack. You have to use Bluetooth ear buds. I have not tried to set up Bluetooth earphones, so I can't comment on how easy, or difficult that may be. For me, this is definitely not ideal. Wireless ear buds need to be constantly charged up, and I find them uncomfortable and they easily get bumped out of my ear. That being said, the display on the 12.9 is beautiful, and the larger size works really well for on line zoom meetings and video lessons. The battery lasts all day, so far. Time will tell if the battery life deteriorates as the months go by.

  This is honestly my favorite way to use a computer. HDR 4K content is great, and it gets pretty loud so my wife and I can watch something together. I watch a lot of lecture/educational content often while taking notes. The large extremely high definition screen makes reading text in a video easy, or easy to share the screen with my note taking app.,It’s not perfect though let me go over some things that could improve.,The bezels are so small holding it can be awkward.,The mini keyboard makes typing while holding easier, but I wish the mini keyboard had a bit more like a number row.,The blooming can be annoying, but it’s basically only noticeable during load screens.,The camera probably should be positioned for landscape video calls not portrait.,I wish I could play nes and snes games on it. It has more than enough power to run emulators, but without jail breaking there is no side loading.,This thing is expensive, but if you think you want to use a tablet. This is the one.,Side note about me: I use a one plus 6 Android phone and my computer is Linux/windows so I’m not an apple fan boy. I do think the iPad is by far the best tablet computer. I did have a MacBook Pro and it broke and I learned why repairability is important. Don’t buy something you can’t afford to replace it. So get AppleCare+.

  This is my 4th iPad, I have had the 2nd gen, the 4th gen, and the first generation 12.9 iPad Pro, and this 12.9 M1 iPad Pro by far the best one yet. The XDR Liquid Retina screen must be seen to be believed, but needs to have UHD HDR content for it to really shine. The new chips made it sooo fast, I hope future software updates will take advantage of that speed. I purchased the 256Gb storage with 8Gb memory, because the 1Tb model with 16Gb memory was out of my budget. I see on YouTube some of the pundits say that the 12.9 iPad Pro is too big and heavy, I ask is a sheet of typing paper too large, and at 1.5 pounds only a very small child would deem it too heavy to hold. I bought the Apple Pencil and Apple Magic Keyboard, later purchased the ESR Magnetic Smart Case/Folio and relegated the Magic Keyboard to a desktop docking station. Don’t get me wrong the Magic Keyboard is good but it is so heavy and adds so much thickness I just don’t want to lug it around, better just on the desk. The Smart Cover is very light and thin and also has a flap to keep the pencil in place, easy to carry around.

  The product itself is good. The downside is for artists like myself. While using procreate, it overheats often and will basically turn itself/make itself unusable until it’s cooler. The thing is, it doesn’t feel hot at all. Not sure if this is a product error or if it’s for real. Pretty disappointing when you’re grooving along with your art and then you have to take a forced break.

  Battery life is worse than an comparable Apple laptop. Brightness is a bonus as it does get brighter than a laptop but for whatever reason Apple chose miniLED which has excessive and unacceptable light blooming (especially if you use dark mode). They use OLED on the iPhone and reach 800 nits and OLED TVs are plenty capable as well, should have gone OLED and I’m sure they will which makes this a subpar “transition” product. Also, only one USB-C port in a space where this is competing with laptops with twice to four times the number of USB-C ports.

  Really amazing headphones. Sound great, noise cancellation is 10/10, comfort is 9/10 (you don’t even really notice the weight). So as for headphones go, these are awesome.,The 3 things that keep me from giving it 5 stars:,1) Condensation. It’s real and it’s worrisome. Condensation constantly forms when using these. You remove the ear pad (it detaches easily cos it’s magnetic) and you see lots of water droplets. Not sure if all over the ear headphones do this and these are noticeable only because you can remove the cup, but until Apple releases a statement about it I cannot recommend it to anyone. It very well may be accounted for and is not going to affect the headphones’ longevity, but again, Apple needs to release a statement already.,2) The price. $549 is a lot,3) the case. just wtf. why they did that,If Apple comments on the condensation, i’d bump it up to 4 stars.,Had an issue when they were delivered but it was more on Amazon rather than Apple. Amazon really took care of me though, so 5 star for that amazing Amazon customer service.

  First off, I'm not saying DONT buy the AirPods Max, in whatever color you desire. BY all means, please get them, they are a fantastic paid of headphones, comfortable in everyway, amazing sound quality, worth every penny, especially if you enjoy music and are deep into the Apple ecosystem like a lot of people are.,What I am saying is DO NOT BUY these from Amazon. I bought 2 pairs back to back, returning BOTH of them. Why?,Because they were NOT new. They were both used.,Neither of the packages came with the Apple arrow pull shrink wrap. They both had stickers on the outside of the box, stickers that werent put there by Apple. One of them even stated ""Would you like to add Adeel's AirPods Max to your phone"" ?,I may have been one to experience a fluke, maybe even 2 in a row, but I wasnt about to give them $500 for used headphones. I'll be buying them straight from Apple for full price and happy to do so.

  Straight up -- audio equipment is subjective.,Do these sound fantastic? I think so.,Are the comfrotable? For me they are.,How does the ANC perform? Its second-to-none.,Are they worth the $550 asking price? Probably not.,Honestly, if I wasn't already heavily (but also happily) invested in the Apple ecosystem (I write as I type this up on an over-priced MacBook) I probably would've skipped on these bad boys -- but I am and the benefits the H1 chips and the sweet macOS/iOS-only features only sweeten the deal.,If you're not as wrapped up in the Apple ecosystem, as I so pathetically am, you would probably be better served by a pair of Bose QCs or Sony XM4s. That being said, I have thoroughly enjoyed just sitting in my chair with these cans strapped on as I zone out to my music while society continues to crumble around me... that, to me, is worth the $550 investment.

Nicholas Calderone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After I perused the specs and got over the sticker shock of the price tag, I thought, “These might be worth the investment for me.” I have high-end hearing loss, and because of that, most speakers, earbuds, and headphones don’t do much for me. I have an especially hard time hearing dialogue on our TV unless the sound is being pumped through our HomePods. That is what caused me to pause and really consider the purchase. “What if the AirPods Max is like putting HomePods on your ears?” That was worth it to me.,After setup was completed, I put the headphones on my ears and heard the first sounds through the AirPods Max. It was a Christmas song that I had heard dozens of times before. The sound was so rich, deep, and clear that it was like I was hearing the song for the first time. “Ok, there is no way these sound this good.” At that moment, Robyn, my fiance, walked into the room and said, “So, are they like having HomePods attached to your ears?” All I could do was nod yes. She gave me a look and I handed them over to her. She put the headphones on her ears and scrolled through my library until she found something she wanted to play. She then said she had to have a pair.,When I test headphones, I have a few go-to songs I like to try out so that I can get an idea of the listening experience of the headphones from every angle. The songs are pulled from a variety of genres including soundtracks, rock, grunge, punk, classical, and even a bit of rap. The AirPods Max does an incredibly nice job with all of them. The headphones keep a nice, deep bass sound while protecting the integrity of the rest of the track. I also found that vocals are crisp as well and I really love that as I turn up the volume, that I don’t get any distortion. That’s not been the case with other headphones I’ve used.,Overall, I’ve been impressed with all the features of the AirPods Max. Here’s a brief rundown of my thoughts on the main features of the headphones.,Active Noise Canceling (ANC): Until I used the AirPods Max, the ANC on the Sony headphones was the best I’ve ever used. I took the Sony headphones on a flight a few years back and never heard the airplane’s engine noise. Therefore, I’ve always regarded the ANC on the Sony MDR-1000X as the ‘best’. While I haven’t taken the AirPods Max on a plane yet, I can say that it deadens ambient noises like dogs barking, vacuums, and TVs that are left on in the background.,Mesh Headband:  I love the look of the headband. I think it looks very clean and it accentuates the lines of the AirPods Max. The design is right up my alley.,Weight: I’ve heard some people say that the weight of the headphones is an issue for them. I have noticed that they feel a bit heavier than other headphones I’ve used, but the weight seems evenly distributed to me and so it doesn’t bother me. I’ve worn the headphones for several hours at a time and have not had any issues with headaches or soreness.,Buttons: I am a big fan of the buttons. This is odd for me to say since I never thought I would be a proponent of moving to analog from digital, but Apple did a nice job of blending in the Digital Crown and the ANC button.,Smart Case: This is one thing I would have reconsidered if I were designing the AirPods Max — the Smart Case. I really consider it more of a ‘sleeve’ than a case because — well, that’s what it is. The sleeve is made with a single piece of what seems to be polyurethane material and utilizes magnets for the closure. While the sleeve does protect the metal earpieces of the headphones from getting scratched up, for the most part, it doesn’t protect the headband and there is even a cut out on the bottom that leaves the headphones exposed to the elements and potential damage. I also noticed that when I take the headphones out of the sleeve that the AirPods clink together. The only way I’ve been able to stop that from happening is if I physically place my hand there.,Even though there might be a few minor things I would like to see improved about the AirPods Max, I’m absolutely thrilled with them. They are far superior to any other listening experience I’ve had and think that their price tag is worth the investment. Even though the cost is prohibitive for many, if you want the ultimate listening experience, I can’t recommend the AirPods Max enough.

David Whitcher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  For the past ten years I have enjoyed and been dependent upon noise canceling headphones. With that has come a journey into the audiophile community with others who are on a quest for high-fidelity sound. My journey led me to many headphones that sound absolutely pristine but none with  noise canceling and few are wireless. Until late, the Bose Noise Canceling 700 are my compromise for great sound and noise canceling in a wireless headphone. So, when Apple announced the AirPods Max, I had to try them to know how they compare to my Bose 700. Here are my conclusions so far...,STYLE,The fit and finish on the AirPods Max is absolutely beautiful!  Love it much more than the Bose. I just like the way they look and feel. Before I purchased the AirPods I probably watched 50 unboxing and review videos. So, I thought I had a good idea of how they looked.  They are nicer in person.  Sleek, premium, modern and minimalistic.,COMFORT,Comfort is about the same!  AirPods Max are definitely heavier but do not necessarily feel much heavier on he head as the weight is balanced well.  I have larger ears and the ear cups on the Bose 700 go a little deeper to make room for my ears. So, over several hours, the Bose do feel slightly more comfortable. The Bose also do not get as warm as the Apple.,TRANSPARENCY MODE,Transparency mode, in my opinion, is actually more natural on the Bose. The Apple headphones actually amplify the sound around you a few decibles too much. In other words, things sound louder than they actually are with the transparency mode on the AirPods Max.  Also, the Bose reproduces your own voice much more naturally when in transparency mode.,SOUND QUALITY,Sound quality at certain volume levels is almost exactly the same. Kind of unbelievable. It is as though Apple reverse engineered the Bose 700 and copied its sound signature and noice canceling to within 5 percent. There is  a definite sound quality difference though that changes with the volume level. This is all about the DSP. Of course, the digital signal processing (DSP) is called Computational Audio on the Max and Volume Optimized EQ on the Bose. This is what works differently and what accounts for sound differences dependent on the volume. Basically, the Bose sound better at 60 percent volume and below. Bose just has it dialed in so that everything sounds rich and balanced. I usually listen to music at about 55 percent volume on my iPad. So, I prefer the sound of the Bose. The sound at 60 percent and below on the AirPods Max suffers from a veiled upper midrange. An alto saxophone, for example, will sound as though it is being played behind a wooden door.,Now between 60 and 70 percent volume is where both headphones sound virtually the same. It is uncanny! Both sound absolutely wonderful. Probably the best you will ever hear on wireless noise canceling headphones (yes, the Sony has an amplified and unnatural mid-bass making them sound deep but not high fidelity).,At 70 percent volume and above the Bose DSP begins to lower the bass response to avoid distortion. The bass gets progressively quieter as you increase on the Bose to where there is virtually no bass at about 90 percent volume.  The AirPods Max, on the other hand, handle bass very nicely from 70 all the way up to 100 percent. In fact, they sound perfectly balanced all the way from 60 to 100 percent volume with no sound quality degradation. If there is a fault it is that the bass looses a little nuance. In other words at high volumes the bass is a little over controlled.  The softer vibrations like on the trail of a bass string get lost a little.,So to summaries the sound comparisons.  The two headphones sound equal from 60 to 70 percent volume. The Bose sound bette at 60 percent volume and below. Finally, the AirPods sound better (by quite a bit, it’s not even close) at 70 percent volume and above.,CONTROLS,The final comparison are the controls. Apple wins in my book.  The Digital Crown has a perfect feel to it. It rotates very smoothly with a perfect amount of resistance. It presses well also. Apple has hyper dialed-in these controls. It makes me never want to have to use the touch-pad on the Bose 700 ever again.,WHICH ONE IS FOR ME?,Everything is comparable on these two headphones, but in the end, sound quality at my preferred listening level wins out. Since I listen to at about 50 percent volume, the Bose continue to be he choice for me. I just have a fixed routine for when I use noise canceling headphones.,Now, I am sure that Apple could probably update their firmware to adjust the computational audio in order to fix the balance issues below 60 percent volume. If they did, then the fit and finish and controls might win me back over to the AirPods Max.  But, the slight compromise in long-term comfort would cause me to hesitate a little.,ONE LAST THING,One last thing, the spatial audio is pretty Amazing. If I had to watch movies on my iPad these headphones would be a must. The surround sound effects are as good (slightly better) than my Bose home theatre system. The overall sound quality for movies is slightly less (more sterile and hollow sounding, probably because of the limited Bluetooth codec) than my Bose home theatre system.

  I decided to spoil myself and try these out. Reviewers say they're excellent and have the best ANC/transparency mode out there, and they damn well better for $550. So are they all they're hyped up to be? Is Apple taking the audio world by storm and revolutionizing music as we know it? No. Not by a long shot.,I'll try to categorize and simplify my thoughts:,-Build Quality:,  In classic Apple fashion, the hardware is very good. Metal and high quality fabrics are present, no Apple logos or graphics to stain the clean and sleek design, and the magnetic replaceable earcups are genius (albeit expensive at $69 a pair).,-Controls,  The button/knob wheel combo is simple yet effective. I much prefer physical buttons to touch controls (The Sony WH-1000XM3's have infuriating touch controls and apparently the M4's aren't much better) and Apple does it right. One button to switch between ANC/transparency mode and no mode at all, and the knob to control the volume as well as play and pause. Super simple, as it should be. However, I couldn't help but notice how little resistance the buttons have, which makes them easy to press. This resulted in me accidentally pressing something almost every time I put on/took off/adjusted my headphones if I grabbed them from the top. Just something to note.,-ANC/Transparency Mode:,  Transparency mode on these is EXCELLENT. Voices almost sound like they're in your head and everything is made not only louder, but clearer as well. Much better than the Airpod Pros. The ANC however, to me was a bit of a let down. It was difficult finding the different between ANC and no mode at all, but I suspect this might have something to do with....,-The Fit,  I have a big problem with the fit. It's a little hard to explain in text but I'll give it a shot. Ideally, when the headphones are put on, the main cans sit flat on your ears and are parallel to each other to create a nice seal around your ear, like this  {|  |}  . But due to the hinge design that connects the main cans to the headband, they have too much area to move around in a sense, and they end up fitting more like this  {/  \}  , which results in too much pressure being applied at the top of the main cup and not enough at the button, creating an opening at the button of my ear where not only the music escapes through, but outside noise bleeds in as well. I have tried every length and adjusted them in every way possible but that is an unavoidable flaw in the design. Could it be due to my weird head shape? Possibly, but it's not something I've never experienced in over-ear headphones, so I'm blaming Apple for this one.,-Sound,  So they don't fit well and ANC is balls. Could the sound save it perhaps? Will you weep in joy at the Apple engineering that made such beautiful vocals and trembling bass possible? No. I would call it average. SLIGHTLY better than the Airpod Pros. My V-Moda M-100's, almost a decade old, sh!t on these, spit in their face, curb stomp them, pick them up, then sh!t on them once more, all at half the price (and they straight KILL them once I connect them to my FiiO BTR5) all at half the price or so. Sound is okay, bass is lacking for me, volume is shockingly low. Just an overall disappointment.,Final Verdict:,  These aren't bad headphones at all, not by any means. Great build quality, banging transparency mode, and average sound. But for five hundred and FIFTY DOLLARS it should be FANTASTIC sound, with SILENT ANC, and more accessories than a single cable and a DIAPER for a case (which is frankly pathetic). There is much better out there for cheaper. I personally recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4's (I actually have the M3's but they're apparently really similar to the M4's so not enough for me to upgrade but great deal for first time buyers). Great sound, great ANC, great fit, comfortable, wonky controls but not a dealbreaker, with actual useful accessories and a proper carrying case at half the price. Or V-Modas. Or Sennheisers. Or Airpod Pros. Anything within the $200-$300 range really will do anything these do and most likely better. I generally like Apple products and can justify owning my Airpods (both regular and Pros), iPad, and even the Watch, as they offer an experience I just can't quite get with other products, through the hardware and software, but these are a giant swing and a miss, and I will be returning them within the week. I am not rating it 2 stars because they're bad. I am rating it as such for the incredibly bad value for money you're getting.

  The watch comes with a charger that takes a different kind of plug in instead of the standard USB plug in, now I have either order an aftermarket charging cable or a new charging block, I guess this is a petty way of apple trying to pick your wallet. So if anyone buys one of these watch's you may want to make sure that you have the new block or an after market USB charging cable, this set us back on the Christmas present until we can get something to charge the watch with.
"

  I have been happy with my purchase other than the fact that it came with a USB-C charging cable. Along with that, there is no power connector so if you don't have a USB-C charging port you won’t be able to charge the watch. If you decide to buy this watch, I recommend also purchasing a USB-C to USB connector so you can charge your watch. Apple, if you're reading this, please start including a proper charger with your apple watches. Thanks!

  What the heck!  After receiving my watch and realizing this cord isnt USB and I have no way of charging it I start asking around and googling I finally determine this is a  a USB-C connector( I had to do research to figure out what the heck this was even called) and now I have to spend more money to be able to charge this darn thing when the watch isn't cheap in the first place. Frustrating to say the least. I bought the SE model if that makes a difference. I went back into the listing and the packaging and no where does it say this comes with USB-C charging capabilities.....the package does say after looking, and in very small print ""power adapter sold seperately"".

  I love this product but.....,Battery life could be better.  I was a Samsung phone and watch user for years.  I switched to the Apple system and have been very happy.  My only disappointment so far has been battery life.  I can't use the watch for sleep tracking because it doesn't last longer than a day.  If I were to wear the watch all night I would have to charge it first thing in the morning.  Unfortunately, I work out first thing in the morning and use the watch for tracking my workout information.  Wish this had the same battery life as my Samsung.  I can wear that for several days without it going dead.

  If you are buying an Apple Watch, you should know it does not come with a power adapter. You need to buy a USB-C adapter. I have other Apple products and thought my existing adapters would work. Wrong. I used my Apple Watch for a day and went to charge it and found out I couldn't because I didn't have the Type C adapter. It had to sit unused until I could order one. Why a company worth Three Trillion Dollars can't include this $15 adapter is beyond my comprehension.,The one day I was able to use the watch It seemed like it will be a nice product for me. I look forward to being able to use it for more than a day.

  The AirPods were already registered to an apple account and it was visible that they had been used.

  Apple changed nothing with the actual headphone design and just updated the charging case with magnets (MagSafe). The original case was still capable of wireless charging. These are awesome headphones and I love mine, but it’s not an upgrade, if that’s what you are looking for. So, if you are looking for a deal, you can get the originals for less.,There is a very good chance that Apple with come up with AirPods Pro 2 in the first half of  2022 and those will be a worthy upgrade. In the meantime, wait if you can. Definitely a 5-star set, but taking away one star for Apple calling it an update, while it’s not!,If you are looking to purchase now, these are real Apple AirPods Pro, sold and shipped by Amazon, so they carry full warranty.

  I like the sound and the fit (after changing the silicone tips size to find the most comfortable one). Some reviews complain about this not being a new Airpod model, which is true. The product description is clear that the upgrade is only for the case.,If you want to know which case you have, look inside the case on the left airpod's side and you will find the serial number and model. The model for the magsafe case is A2190, introduced in 2021. This is different from the airpods model that you can see from the phone Settings > Bluetooth > YourAirpodName (click the (i) for info), and you will see the model number. As of the date of writing this review, there are 2 possible model numbers introduced in 2019 (A2084, A2083). You can also look at the airpods themselves and you will find the model number written in a very tiny font on them. One side is A2084 and the other is A2083.

  It works great as long as it's working. But after about a week of use, the right ear stopped connecting to my iPhone. I tried all the methods I can find online but nothing worked. My other earbuds from Jabra don't look as good as Airpods but more reliable (almost never dropped connection and still works perfectly after two years of use). I guess they are typical Apple products; looking good but low quality, and break down fast.,I am glad I can return.

  I got these today and I already love them! I unboxed it and they immediately connected to my phone. I didn’t have to do anything except hit ok. Apple got it right with the packaging too. Everything was easy to open with their tabs. The instructions are clear and to the point. They have recessed buttons on them to control play/pause/forward/backward/noise cancellation, which is cool so you don’t accidentally brush a finger on them and mess up your song playing. The multi-sized ear pieces are nice. The small ones work best for me. They are also shorter then the others which is exactly what I was looking for. The sound is great and the noise cancellation works. I can still hear the music and people when noise cancellation is off which is cool cause it’s like having a stereo around you. Or turn on noise cancellation and for the most part block out the world.  Overall I love the size and the sound. They are comfortable unlike other ear phones I have bought. Out of the box they were charged at 73% battery for the ear pieces and 54% for the case. Definitely recommend. I will update if I find any negative about it, but so far none.

The band WILL scratch the watch. No matter how careful you are. That’s damage done in less than a week babying the watch and band as I remove it. If this bothers you I would stay far away from this loop.

  They gave me a 41 millimeter version when I double checked what I got and not just that when I tried the family setup it said to need a gps+cellular and that’s what I got so I have a strong suspicion on them that they gave me only the gps version so I think that they did it on purpose wasting my time and almost tricking $100 from me

  Phone although in new condition, I have to question its longevity. The ""charger cord"" that was sent for one is NOT and APPLE charger. Its a Samsung charger. You only receive part of charger, you don't even get the C port, just a useless cord actually made for another product. This was $400+ wasted not to mention my time...........I honestly expected what I was paying for, yes.

  I love the watch and am sure once I get cell service added it will do exactly what I need it to do.  I got this solely for the “Fall alert” function. I find it a  MUCH cheaper alternative than life alert and those kinds of services.,Many other features - as listed in detail on the watch description., BUT **IMPORTANT TO KNOW**,The “charger” included is the cord only! It has the round disk type on one end of the cord and USB-C end on the other.  It ONLY plugs into a USB-C charging cube.  The cube is NOT included.  You can buy one here for relatively cheap.  But I recommend you buy one when you order the watch if you don’t already have one.  I have an old Galaxy 9S phone that has a C port, so I can charge it on that for now. But that is a short term solution.  My other option was to wait 5 days for Amazon before I can use my watch.,Watch did come with 87% charge, but set up took battery down to 55%.  So you will need a charging cube when you get the watch.  Again- a cube with a C port… NOT a lightening or regular USB port.

  Overall Apple Watch S7 is a great product without doubt. But compared to S6, the improvements are really not big - only a slight bigger screen in my opinion (tangible change). The SoC etc. are the same. So if you have the S6 even S5, there is no need to upgrade from my perspective.

  Phone is awesome. However on day 2 I scratched the watch doing dishes. I thought the watch was indestructible. Come to find out it can crack and scratch. Please get tempered glass and case unless you purchase stainless steel and sapphire glass. This model is 729 gps cellular stainless steel. Make sure you get apple care through carrier think it’s cheaper. Note stainless steel van still scratch but it is quite durable. Other than that this is my 1st Apple Watch and the ease of use is phenomenal as well as the merging of my cell phone with the watch. Mom gave it as a gift and I absolutely love the fact that I can get a real time pulse ox+ hr+ and ekg! Fall detection is great cause I am a diabetic!!! This is the watch for those who want to be independent but have health issues that can  cause barriers to that goal! Safety wise it’s a keeper💪🏾

  Cons: So if you’re switching from a fitbit for your first Apple Watch like myself you’ll miss your Fitbit it doesn’t track your calories all day like your Fitbit because it doesn’t automatically detect your work out/calorie burn.  It doesn’t track your sleep details the same either I almost want to buy a Fitbit..that’s just weird though wearing 2watches…last bad thing is the battery you have to charge it every day oh…and mine wasn’t charging I had to go to Best Buy and get another charger cable I got the one with usb port then it started charging…screw that other one it doesn’t work.,Pros: it’s fun technology I like how my ring notifications come out on my watch and it shows the video. I like how I am washing my hands and it times it. It’s good to check your blood oxygen and heart rate,But that’s it pretty much I can still control my my music like on my fit bit I don’t really text people from my watch I guess that’s the other benefit but other than that nothing really amazing about it. I didn’t get cellular you don’t need it if you always have your phone near by. It connected to my  phone quick. I miss my Fitbit.though the only sad part

  Looking thru all the reviews and most of the negative ones are about battery life not satisfactory. I have tested my Apple Watch series 7 with not having the “always on” display and found that if I turn that setting off I only burn 25-30% battery in a full work day 10 hrs. I don’t know about you but if I’m not looking at my watch, why would I need the display on? When you turn “always on” display feature off watch display comes on only when you look at it immediately and that’s perfect for me. Just go to display and brightness on your phone in the Apple Watch app and turn off “always on” . Think about if your phone had a setting where it was always on……it would be dead in no time and everyone would be complaining the battery doesn’t last.

  Apple does a lot of stuff well.  Mac Books, iMac, iPad, and iPhone.  As a fitness tracker it is excellent and how it integrates so well with the iPhone, but as a watch is another matter altogether.  The short battery life, the rectangular watch face limiting details, and no seconds indication when in low-power-always-on-display mode are all big drawbacks.,The Apple Watch will get you at around 26 hours on a full charge. This is completely unacceptable if you are frequent traveler or someone who falls asleep with their watch on.  It is one more thing to charge in such a short time.  Your phone you put down after some time, but a watch is used more frequently.,Sometimes in 2022 or by 2024, Apple should introduce an Apple Watch which has greater than 36 hours in a round face.  Until then, save your money.

Lunar Kitten,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really want to love these. I own every version of the AirPods from Gen 1 to the Max. The AirPods 3 are almost there but in some ways a step back from Gen 2.,Sound: The drivers are much faster than Gen 2 and have a lot of clarity with every genre of music. The bass is a lot, lot more pronounced due to the size of the resonance chamber and proximity to the air canal. (To get a good bass sound, you need a good seal.),The Spatial Audio is honestly not a big deal at all. I think if you want to be wowed, look into playing your music through a dedicated DAC/Amp.  The Dynamic EQ lives up to its promises playing music with a higher degree of clarity and neutrality only found in the AirPods Max. The Pros come close after the most recent software updates. However, when connected to a non Apple device, the Pros have a very bass heavy sound.,Regarding sound leakage, these leak more than the Gen 1 and 2 design. I would say that at 50% volume or higher, people around you will hear what you’re listening to.,Fit: Apple managed to create AirPods that fit worse than previous generations. For my ear shape, the AirPods Pro actually hurts the cartilage due to its thicker body. So yes, they are more comfortable than the Pros. They are also noticeably lighter than the Pros despite being fairly similar in shape and size. If you own the Pros, take off the detachable ear piece and put them in you ears for a rough, approximate size.,Case: If you’re in the market for accessories to make them stay in your ears better, I’m not sure it’s possible due to how little extra room there is for things like ear hooks. The case itself feels and weighs very similar to the original AirPods case. Everything about the previous versions feels the same in terms of materials and mechanics.,Charging: Charging is as advertised. It can be wirelessly charged with a MagSafe pad or a Qi wireless charger. The downside of using a Qi charger is that the heat that seeps into the case and wearing down battery life. The downside of the MagSafe pad is that the strength of the magnets requires two hands to pull it off. This can also be seen as a plus if you have a cover for your case.,The charging port is a Lightning port and not USB-C.,Hardware: Despite having the same H1 chip as the Gen 2 and Pros, the AirPods 3 are snappier than the Pros (even when I’ve compared them to a brand new pair of the Pros) when it comes to connecting and switch devices. The new skin sensor does a good job of quickly detecting when they’re in your ears which I’m assuming leads to faster activation/ deactivation. The only other AirPods that switch just as quickly are the AirPods Max.,Also, the AirPods 3 don’t suffer from an issue with the AirPods Pro where the audio plays on speaker when you take your AirPods Pro’s out of your ear quickly.,Overall: I really wish that Apple had done more testing to ensure fit. This is a pretty strong performance being as close to “audiophile grade” without all the extra work of IEMs, wires and other hardware. However, since they easily fall out with any activity, you have a limited range of motion when using these — driving, walking, etc. The AirPods 3 are a mixed bag!

  The sound quality is what you would expect from Apple. Overall, I’m happy. They do sound better than the original AirPods.

Eric Iraheta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As another person said these are made for people who don’t like silicone eartips and enjoy the previous generations of airpods everything is good about them the only cons are,This is likely Not meant for people who have small ears, as i’ve read some pointing this issue so beware of that, they are bigger compared to previous gens.,No ANC ( Active Noise Cancellation ),Pros (imo),Buttons that are easier to tap and play/pause audio that doesn’t cause you to move the airpods themselves.,Spatial Audio is the best feature to use, as it upgrades the quality of how much more audio you hear, as well as where you move your head from your phone or any compatible device audio is adjusted in each pod to follow your movement.,If you’re an Airpods Pro fan & love ANC but want spatial audio i’d say wait & save your money til the next release sometime in the future (You won’t be missing out for much longer). Otherwise i recommend getting Airpods Pro for just about $20 more, or Gen 2 if you don’t want ANC, have more average sized ears, and don’t need Spatial Audio. Hope this helps anybody! Nov. 4, 2021

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The only real problem I had with this item is that the pods are made for people with large ear canals which I do not and they kept falling out.  Returned them for the PROs and I am happier.
"
Malcolm Granger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have owned every kind of AirPods made, thus my excitement for the new AirPods 3. In short, get these for the much-improved sound quality, presence, and that noticeable bass, which most earphones lack completely. They are worth the cost over the AirPods 1&2 hands-down. Given the $180 list of the AirPods 3 and the observation that AirPods Pro are sometimes around $200, I think the sound is good in both (Pros not that much better) but with the noise cancellation in the Pros, they win on flights, commute, and offices.,Now the rub; the Airpods 3 just plain HURT my ears over the AirPods 1&2. I know the shapes are similar but somehow the AirPods 3 are slightly larger and press against the upper rim of the ear. After an hour, I need to remove these and reach for the old AirPods. The '3's' hurt as bad my ears as the Pros. And now, I've noticed that the left ear ALWAYS falls out! Ugh, sending back my '3's' - who cares if the bass is good if they hurt to wear.,Too bad. I love the new sound but the pain is so annoying. Make sure you keep the box, since you may need to return these, sadly.
"
Sean Lee,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had these for a couple days now and first thing to notice is that the SIZING IS TERRIBLE. As many have mentioned already, if your ear holes are ginormous, these will be no problem for yall. Mine are on the smaller-to-average size so throughout the day, I notice them loosening/falling out from regular-use, daily activities.,As for the sound, they're pretty nice. Upgraded from 2nd Gen so the tones are definitely noticeable in improvement. I'm sure the sounds would be even more enjoyable if these fit my ears.,MANUFACTURING IS TERRIBLE. I'm very good at taking care of my belongings and I've come to notice a rattling sound in my case... As if there is a loose part running around. If something like this is louder than shaking an hourglass, that's a no-no. As for another complaint, the left earpiece fitment is noticeably off as well. The rounding half that fits onto the other half of the earpiece as a bit of a sharpness to it (due to improper fitment/alignment) and I can occasionally feel that friction in my ear--WHEN IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT ALL THAT WELL!,Anyway, I'm returning these. Have a nice day yall.

Stephen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I loved the Gen 1 and 2 AirPods and had to return the AirPods Pro’s after a cpl days because I could not get those ear tips to fit comfortably no matter what size tips I used.,The overall earbud is slightly larger than gen 2 so if you have small ears like my fiancée then maybe it’s best to stick with Gen 2s for the comfort. However, if you have normal to large sized ears than I highly recommend the 3s.,You get used to the larger earbud size after a cpl hours of wearing them then they are super comfortable like the Gen 2s. The stem is also noticeably shorter and looks better aesthetically.,The main improvement for me was the sound quality and addition of spatial audio. Thought this was all gonna be a gimmick but dang these do legitimately sound better than the 2s even without spatial audio and not all songs have spatial audio functionality but most new songs do. Don’t forget to toggle spatial audio on/off from the control screen so you can hear the difference.,Noise cancellation is slightly better than the Gen 2s because of the physical size of the ear bud but they are by no means noise cancelling; if you need that then the Pros would be a better bet.,All in all I’m super happy with them after a few days and love they just pop into your ears and fit snug like the Gen 2s. Highly recommended!
"
Michele,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you like the 2nd generation AirPods, you’d like these.,Sound Quality: If you’re upgrading from the 2nd gen AirPods like me, then you’ll love these, the sound on the 2nd gen AirPods were always quiet for me, I’d have it almost turned all the way up and could barely hear, plus the quality wasn’t very good. Now these AirPod’s (3rd gen) wow! The sound quality itself is so nice. You can have it on 1/4 volume and hear perfectly.,Fit: I used to have the 2nd gen AirPods and they were a pretty good fit, but they were a tad bit loose, like it felt like it was falling. Now these AirPods (3rd gen) they’re slightly bigger, they fit nice but don’t really go into my ears personally, it kinda just sits there but it’s stays in so that’s good.,Battery Life: the battery life on these are amazing! I can be listening to music for like 15 mins and the charge only goes down by 1-2 percent, they last a long awhile and the charging case as-well, way more than the 2nd gen.,Overall I’d rate these 3rd generation AirPods a 8/10, I highly recommend you get them especially if you have the 2nd generation. These are a nice upgrade.
"
Amanda Prince,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you have smaller ears and perhaps liked the Second Generation AirPods, these are not for you.  They are much larger than the Second Generation and did not stay in my ears.  I wanted to love them due to the sound quality (EXCEPTIONAL) but I would not feel safe going for a run or even any kind of jumping exercise with these in.  On top of it, when they did stay in, say just sitting still listening to something or on a call, they really hurt that little ear flap after a while!  People say the Pros are better (even though they are the same large shape) because of the adjustable ear piece, but I don't see how that would help the comfortability factor.

Anon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had these for just over 1 month.  I have been resistant to replacing the basic, Apple wired earbuds, but finally caved because it seems inevitable that we are all getting pushed into a world where wired earbud support will completely disappear.  (For now, we are saved by adapters)  I really tried to be open minded and patient with these for the past month.  Sound quality is ok, (though I swear my Apple wired buds actually sound crisper/cleaner),  case/design is gorgeous. They happen to fit my ears perfectly.  Wireless to replace perfectly working technology (wired earbuds) at many many times over the price, and with many many times problems including trouble getting them to connect to my device and audio being continually interrupted... horrible experience!!!!  I wear earbuds primarily to help me focus on my work.  Throw that out the window when audio cuts out between 10 and 100 times per hour... urrrrrgghh frustrating.  I only caved and bought these because everyone seems to insist how great they are.  I hate them and regret the purchase.  Unless you just buy products for bragging rights, run away from this, and don’t look back.  I could have bought a lifetime supply of wired earbuds for these pointless excuses to put highly volatile/explosive lithium ion battery powered devices snugly wedged in our ears, as close as possible to our brains, airpods.,—- UPDATE —-,I changed my review from 1 star to 4 stars. Once I got a newer iPhone, the audio issues seem to disappear.  Pardon my overly negative review above..  that said, I am leaving my previous feedback given that the AirPods *should* have worked with my older iPhone.  I still don’t love the idea of earbuds that must be charged, and I’m still convinced the sound quality is not as good as my wired pair.  As long as these are working, though, I’m content enough.  I don’t think I could ever give 5 stars for a $180 pair of earbuds, but I guess that’s more a me problem than an Apple problem.

  Processes on the iPad are very slow due to the CSAM scanning they implemented. Apple sells user data to advertisers and is one of the least privacy focused companies out there. That plays into the iPad and everything you do is tracked and sent to Apple. They even enabled iCloud backups unencrypted by default at the request of the FBI, so make sure you turn that off immediately. Wouldn’t buy another. Apple sucks.

  Very disappointed.  Was eager to get my ipad pro but then i saw a dead pixel on the screen.  contacted amazon support and asked me to ""massage"" the screen.  offered me 10% compensation which is 70$ for the trouble of returning.  also, amazon cannot exchange for a new one.  dont know why.  apparently because of the high price value.  in the end, i returned it.  note that if there is a dead pixel, there is a high probability that there will be more dead pixels in the future.

Maxx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased an iPad Air first, and I had an issue with it, so I returned it. In the back of my mind I really kept thinking about the new M1 chip, so instead of getting another iPad Air, I upgraded to the iPad Pro.,Performance wise, there is no difference that I can tell. The iPad Air was super responsive and fast in all tasks.,I do like the face recognition better, when it works correctly. I don’t have to do anything to open my iPad, and that is better compared to the Touch ID. The new Touch ID works great though, much better than the old version. The issue with face recognition is that sometimes it wears you out asking you to use your password to open your iPad. I don’t like that at all. I was told that the iPad will learn my face better in time, and I will not have to use the password as much. I’ve turned everything I can password related off, and added as many different face scans as possible.,The FaceTime camera being 12mp is awesome. It’s nice to press the flip button and take selfies in 12mp. They look amazing.,Even though I probably would have been fine with the iPad Air, I do feel better knowing the M1chip will probably add a few years of use at the end of this iPads life cycle.

  No info on getting set up, just trial and error procedure.  Can't go online as the ipad only goes where it wants to go.  It takes hours of trying and most times I just give up as you can enter the location you want to visit but this takes you where it wants you to go.  It is so obvious it is just trying to control my spending and push its agenda.  I am crazy enough without the aggravation of this inexcusable excuse for wi-fi use.  It takes far too long to get things accomplished, that is if you ever can.  Horrible..HORRIBLE.  I have limited internet service and this just eats up my usage without any accomplishment.
"
J Richardson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This device is amazing. Sleek, fast with m1, screen is beautiful.,All that Apple needs to do is to update iPadOS so that it has better:,1) multitasking and windowing support;,2) a file management app that actually has a format media and an unmount media function (as it stands you can’t currently unmount your external disk safely on iPadOS14.. which can lead to data loss, and you also can’t format a disk using the iPad);,3) multi-monitor support that uses the full aspect ratio of the external display and can display in extended mode. As it stands, the current implementation on iPadOS is to display a mirrored image of the iPad’s screen onto an external monitor. There’s no ability on a system level to display a separate image on the external monitor (some apps have this function but it’s a per-app feature rather than a system wide feature). This defeats the whole point of using a monitor with the iPad in the first place. I don’t want the image to be mirrored.,The second issue with multi monitor support is a more egregious limitation in my opinion.  That is, the iPad will not by default display an image on the external monitor in its native aspect ratio. Most monitors these days are 16x9 or 16x10, but the iPad will by default display its image in 4x3 mode, meaning there will be black bars to the sides of the image on the external monitor. This is egregious. The iPad only uses a portion of the external monitor instead of using the whole screen. The very same m1 chip inside the iPad Pro is also inside of various macs, and all of these m1 devices except the iPad can display an image to an external monitor in the monitor’s native aspect ratio.  So this is a limitation that Apple has chosen to allow to exist.  Apple really needs to fix this.,But other than these quirks and limitations, the iPad Pro is a fabulous device. I love it.

  Can’t find 1 external sd card or usb drive that works even if the vendor says it will, you have to use multiple dongles for everything plus have a hub that you have to keep powered by a cord line and then it might work, etc…oh, and try to find an app that you can use to read the attachment…haven’t found one yet…and try to plug a hub in if you have a case on…..I can do more with my Apple IPad Air 2 which is ancient! NOT worth the 1000 dollar price in my book! Cords, dongles for everything that are plugged into a power source all the time….can’t even plug into a computer without it sending you to some online network database to even copy to the device…maybe I will find something that works with this thing that is of use to me…I will keep looking…

  I bought this Ipad brand new and it was defective right out of the box. It kept turning off even when the battery was 100% charged. At first I thought it was just a minor issue but when I contacted Amazon and a technician ran all the tests it kept doing it. I was told someone else was going to contact me for follow up the next day and gave all my info and no one ever called! Is really shocking how Amazon could take that so lightly when is such an expensive item, brand new! This Ipad was the latest model and costed more than $1,000. Finally I called Apple and scheduled an on person appointment on the Apple Genius Bar for the next day and they were amazing and replaced the item with no questions asked for another brand new IPad closed in the box. It was opened in front of me and tested before I went out of the store. The technician also passed all my data to the new one. So thanks Apple! I recommend you buy this products directly from them and not from Amazon.

  It is a great tablet but the size is way too big for portability and casual use. (12.9 inch) Definitely for individuals with bigger hands. Also, the software is lackluster. If you’re getting this to replace a laptop be prepared to be disappointed. It’s still a TABLET. That’s it. Finally the huge black bezels need to go. It’s dumb that the new m1 iPad did not get a redesign. This years iPad is a money grab as the iPad cannot utilize the full power of the m1.

  I’m really happy with Apple, their quality, software, design, …. This iPad is also incredible powerful and for sure more than enough for most applications. The perfect solution for every Apple fan with an iPhone, like me.,BUT: as I have the whole day my iPhone in my hands and “manage” everything with that during the day, a tablet is for me primary a device to watch some movies in the bed (without light).,I said to me “let’s buy the new iPad with Mini-LEDs and the great contrast. With real black and not a dark grey as every iPad I had before”…,I saw many reviews on YouTube and they mentioned a blooming, but finally always say that the picture is great….,For everyone who does believe that: watch the first 2 minutes of Star Wars VII. I stopped after that and sent the tablet back. You will never get that out of your mind and cannot watch any movie again in the dark.,It’s really sad but I found the perfect picture in a dark environment with an Android tablet. I will come back to iPads when they have OLEDs.,If you never watch in a complete dark room: buy the iPad!

  It’s better than previous versions BUT unless you are using it for heavy duty applications you won’t see much difference., It is faster.,The picture is better. (See photo, version 2 versus this one),But not a very noticeable lot of either.,If you are using your previous version for lightweight applications such as spreadsheets, surfing, etc., save your money.,Were it not for a broken screen on mine think I would save my money and return this one, still might.

  First off, What bloom?  I don't have any distortion at all on my 12.9 inch mini led screen.  It' is crisp and clear when watching intensive HDR content or regular content.  Blacks are black, colors pop, beautiful screen.,I would recommend it to anybody.  I didn't go for the 1T with 16GB ram because I just don't need it.,Go for it, you will love it.

Electrosoft,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Well built, excellent performance.,My only problem is while is clearly performs better than my old 2nd gen 12.9, it isn't massively noticeable right now. Webpages load in faster. A few games run quicker but for other day to day tasks? Meh.,I do like the screen, but it isn't jaw dropping. It is just....better.,My previous model had all the bells and whistles (512GB, Cellular), but using an iphone a hot spot was just as good and after reviewing my storage usage, I sat at a whopping 46GB after 4 years of usage so this model offered more than enough storage along with the updated screen and M1 processor.,I sold my 2nd gen unit when I purchased this one, but in hindsight if I still had my 2nd gen there is a strong chance I would have returned this one as the cost to perceived performance upgrade for my needs just wasn't compelling enough but in the end it is what it is and I do like it.,Still, like always, I find myself using it extensively on a daily basis and it just works and gets the job done so kudos to Apple.,5/5

  This is a tablet meant for professionals and students imo. If you're busy consuming media, just save your money and the get iPad air. I'm using this for video editing, photo editing, graphic design, and using it when going for my second college degree to take notes and help with everything else in between.,And as for the screen bloom, it's not there lol. You people complaining are on drugs or need to clean your glasses. The pictures everyone posts complaining about it, your camera will make it look terrible and “bloomy” 🙄. The display is perfect for editing photos. Once again, if you’re consuming media mainly, go buy a cheap android 😂
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m loving the iPad Pro so far….. I purchased it mainly to get a bigger screen than my regular iPad has. I don’t plan to use it for graphic design or anything so I DO wish that they offered a regular iPad with a larger screen vs having to shell out the $$$ for a Pro model.,My only complaint is that the iPad screen does have quite a bit of bloom around a white text on a black background. This is VERY noticeable on videos where you have a light colored text on a black background, but I haven’t noticed it very much on videos that are moving. If you’re using the iPad for anything graphic design related you may not like the bloom on the screen in instances where you’re doing light design on a dark background and frankly at this price point you’d expect a better screen.,If you’re looking for your first tablet, iPad is the way to go (especially if you have Apple products at home already). You may want to consider a cheaper model if you mainly plan to use for web browsing, light video watching.

  This is the best value of the Apple watches - all the functionality at a great price. The battery life could be better, but it charges quickly and lasts a full day even with a lot of workouts! It's also thinner so doesn't get caught on the cuff of a coat or sweater. Tracking is excellent and although I don't wear it to sleep (if you wear it to bed, you have no time to charge unless you take it off during the day). I love the available APPs and the number of cool watch faces! It's a super-star!

  I wanted to be pleased with this device but am somewhat disappointed in the fact that all this fitness information is only for a week. If you want to be able to track monthly or yearly totals, you have to download “HealthView” app and pay $30 a year for that, although they give you the first year for $14.99.

  The Apple Watch se is my first smart watch. After using it for some time I can say I love this watch so much! It’s usefulness as an extension of my phone is worth it! I have only good things to say about this watch. The only thing that could improve it is if it came with a power brick for the charger. I don’t have the latest iPhone so I don’t have a usb type c charger brick. Luckily for me my laptop does so I can use that to charge my watch. All together I say this is a very useful smart watch. It’s cheaper than other models and much better than previous series (or so I’m told). 10/10 great smart watch!

  After doing much research and comparing all of the apple watches, I finally decided to purchase the Apple SE.  So far I really like it.  It has everything I could ever need, plus more.  The only thing that I hate so far is that the battery life doesn't even last 2 days.  Previously I had a fitbit, which looked like my apple watch, and it's battery lasted an entire week.  Even with the battery issue, I would still recommend this watch!

  Great watch. Has a lot of features that I’m still learning. The fitness and sleep data are mediocre. The watch is very comfortable. Battery life is not the best. I have to charge daily, you can probably turn off some features to save on battery life.

  In a nutshell…worth the price. It does more than I could want it to do. There are so many features I have yet to even explore. I was hesitant on getting this bc did I need it? No. Did I really need/want to spend the money when I had a fit bit? No. But so glad I did. The only complaint I have after having it for a few months is the battery life last much less than my fit bit did. My Fitbit would last me like 4 days where this gets me maybe 2. But it could be that I’m doing much more on my Apple Watch like voice to text, music, and just playing around with it trying to learn it. Get the watch, thank yourself later.

  An amazing watch for being the cheapest of the Apple smartwatches.  It has so many different settings that I have not found them all, so this rating is a little on the blind side.  I do not see any reason to be buy the Apple Watch 7, when the SE is available for those of us who do not need all the bells and whistles of a more expensive watch.

  I am 73 years old. The week after I purchased this watch I fell. This watch immediately alerted to ask if I needed emergency help. The emergency button was on screen available for me to press if I was injured or could not get up. It requested confirmation that I did not need help. I wish I had it earlier this year when I had broken my foot from a fall, rather than hobbling to a phone I could have just pressed the emergency button. Thank you, Apple Watch.

GeorgiaPeach,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  None too pleased about a couple things: Made in China, and didn’t come with a USB-C charging block. I happen to be temporarily staying near my parents’ home in the middle of nowhere where I can’t just drive down the road to pick one up, which means I have to drive 30 miles and it’s continually snowing here with bad roads or order one and wait. When you’re from Atlanta and have everything at your fingertips, this sort of frustration should not be encountered, particularly when dealing with Apple. We Apple buyers have grown accustomed to the finer details and Apple cheaping out leaving us inconvenienced like this is extremely the wrong move by Apple. For me, it’s not about the cost to go buy a $10 USB-C block, it’s the inconvenience and hassle it poses me that I have to drive 30 miles one way in the stupid snow to do it. Geeze. Now my pretty new watch sits here dead.

  Clearly this was a trick of some sort because what I was sent was not an Apple Watch rather than Apple piece of an Apple band. I am not sure where this went wrong but this box was empty and looked tampered with felt light I’m sure either I was sent a used product or somewhere between shipping and delivery something happened. For the price I paid this is not right.

  It’s a watch lol. What more do you want. Alright, let’s see. screen is great. Scratch resistant but not impervious. Which is fine. Great product.,…You can talk to your watch for calls. Just like power rangers. What more do you need lol.,The box that it comes in is worth it too. Love the box presentation. Love it.,One big FLAW… doesn’t seem to want to work with Amazon music. Guess apple company doesn’t quite like its competitors. But it will connect to pandora lol.

  I felt like my Fitbit had been old enough to start being less accurate. And given that I have fallen into all of the Apple products, it seemed like the Apple Watch was a no brainer. It has been nothing but frustrating. I can’t figure out how to turn specific things on or off, and it even vibrates at four in the morning to tell me if it needs to be recharged, or if there’s any other insignificant thing going on. I turned off notifications and can’t figure it out. Also, I really appreciate it looking at Fitbit and looking at my steps. Not having to click 1 million things to see my heartbeat or my steps for the day. I can’t figure it out how to answer the phone, it’s not working with half of my stuff, it acts like it sends an email and it doesn’t.  I am completely bummed about spending money on some thing that was supposed to be helpful. I should’ve stuck with the Fitbit.
"
Brandon Golueke,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The item works fine. Lots of great features for sure. However there were a couple of issues that make this product over priced. The first disappointment was that it only comes with half a charger! Luckily my wife already had a charger. The next was that this thing really only has a days worth of battery life. I have to take it off so often and forget to put it back on. I bought this thing to monitor health, which it does very well, however i have to take it off to charge every single night which means heart health isn’t tracked at night. For 500 plus dollars, this product should come with a charger (come on!) and it should have a better battery. Going to return it if I can.

  Initially, I never wanted a Smart Watch. Then, my husband got one & I thought his was pretty cool. SO I started looking at one similar to what he had (a Fossil), but was unable to find something I liked, or could even tolerate. Since I have (and love) my iPhone, I decided to look into the Apple watched, and found this one on Amazon. Although the price was rather off-putting, my husband & I decided that, with all of the health benefits the watch has, I should go ahead & order it. Well, since getting the watch. I've worn it all day, every day, and I simply think the watch is AMAZING! I can check my heart rate throughout the day (something I need to do), and keep an eye on my blood sugar levels (since I am a Type One Diabetic, and have the DexCom App on my iPhone, it also shows on my watch--how cool!). The watch encourages me to stand up a couple of times an hour, which is great, since I work from home & sit at a computer for eight hours/day. I love that I can make/receive phone calls from the watch, too. In the week that I've had my watch, I've found that I use my watch more than I use my iPhone. And to think that I was so.very.opposed to getting a Smart Watch... Now, I don't know how I ever got by without it.

  Honest Review...,the good, the bad & the goofy.,I own and use the 2nd gen & now the 3rd gen.,The good ...,The 3rd gen sound great and they are more (sound cancelation) than the 2nd gen.,I like that they are a little shorter, they don't go flying as easily when you take off a shirt or wipe away some sweat.,The bad...  but not that bad,The airpods are a little bigger, the 2nd gen fit great for me.,Extended use tend to hurt my ears a little. Thats just me.,I like that they are shorter... but it is not always easy to use the squeeze feature, 1,2,3 times. But it works well.,I likes the tap on the 2nd gen. Working with wet or dirty hands it just Seemed to work easier.,Now the goofy....,the 2nd gen were easy to get in and out of the case.... for some reason i struggle to get these in or out of the case.,Ya i might just be old. Im 50.,But i have both 2nd & 3rd gen.,The small struggle with the 3rd gen airpods is worth the the sound quality.,Overall ..... 🤘🏼,I love them

Chungt,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

N. Zafiratos,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have every generation of AirPods and so far these are my favorite for everyday use. Sound way better than gen 1-2 and the pros and much more comfortable.,The pros suck for working out and long use times cause of the tips. Pressure in the ear builds up for many and they get uncomfortable after long use. The pros are incredible for flying and being in loud environments though that's for sure.,These gen 3 will absolutely be my go to AirPods now and my pros are going in my travel bag.,My gen 1 and 2 will be cleaned and given to family members who don't have AirPods. Since I have no need for them any longer with these out!,Lastly, those with smaller ears may still prefer the gen 1 & 2 design for comfort/fitment though since the gen 3's are larger fit and have spacial surround mode which sounds pretty incredible with a good source.

Levi W.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased these AirPods multiple times each arriving with different issue. I’m ver disappointed. I believe Amazon is selling a lower quality variant. The first one I was sent was scratched and we’re extremely quiet. The second pair had poor plastic quality. The seems of the plastic weren’t flush and there was a noticeable ridge. Lastly, I received a third one and it had an annoying buzzing sound. And the magnets were messed up one the right bud. The magnet would catch in a different place every time i put it in the slot. I decided to return all of them because they were not up to apple standards. When returning I lost $20 because I applied credit and Amazon said that their credit is non refundable. This is the first and last time I will ever be buy Apple products from Amazon!
"
Scaper11,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's so disappointing to pay extra for the ""newer"" version of something only to find out the old version was better. This is exactly what happened with the gen 3 airpods. If you love your current airpods just hang on to them. It's getting really annoying that apple only tells you about the ""new"" features and doesn't tell you what you lose when you upgrade.,First they changed the shape so it doesn't fit your ear as well as the prior version. I have to try to jam these in my ear and they constantly fall out. Be sure to try them on before you buy them.,Secondly, they got rid of the super useful tap controls and replaced them with the less useful 'force' control. Which means instead of just tapping your airpod to pause or accept a call you have to feel around your whole head to find the tiny little magic spot on the tiny little stem of the airpod (which is in your ear now since it's shorter than before) and gently pleasure it until it does what apple wants it to (NOT what you want it to- see below). Why anyone would think squeezing the thing would be better than just a simple tap is beyond me. you have to use at least 2 fingers to gently message the stem in just the right way, rather than just a one finger tap (while you are also holding your keys or wallet for example).,Last but not least if you are planning to customize the way you use them (the gestures), like you used to be able to do on the OLDER cheaper version you can forget it. That's gone. Can't customize the new ones. You just have to learn the 42 preset apple gestures of squeeze once for this, three times for that, now spin around and squeeze the other one for siri. It's maddening.,I wore these for an hour then spent 3 hours trying to figure out how to adjust the gestures before i gave up. I immediately went back to my old airpods (gen2) which are far superior to the new more expensive ones. i will probably re-gift these to someone for xmas and I will definitely be betting another gen 2 set.

K. Leaseburg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These earbuds work really well. They’re comfortable in my ear even when laying on them. They stay put. One has fallen out two times total, and one of those times I knocked it out by accidentally hitting the stem while reaching up.  The sound is really good. These come with the sound feature that makes the sound seem directional. In other words, for the first couple days, I kept pulling them out to make sure they were working because the sound from the earbuds seemed like it was coming from my phone. It makes the viewing experience seem more natural. These are not the noise cancelling kind. I can still hear what’s going on around me, which is how I want it. I can hear if someone needs to talk to me without anyone having to yell. I can hear my environment well enough to be safe, but not so it ruins my listening experience. The sound is crisp and clear. They’re rated to last 4 hours before needing to be recharged, but I’ve gone a little longer. They seem to peter  out one at a time, so you can actually charge the dead one and continue using the other one and then switch when the second one goes. This has been helpful for marathon phone conversations. I don’t think this works for listening to content because pulling out one earbud causes the content to pause - another cool feature since you don’t have to find the pause button when you need to stop for a minute. It automatically stops for you and picks right back up when you put the earbud back in. Do you can accomplish the pause by pulling out just one bud. You can always squeeze the post to pause as well. They charge up quickly in the case. The case charges quickly as well (and lasts at least 30 hours between charges).  I bought a silicone case for mine and they still charge easily on the charging mat. They can also charge using a regular lightning cord. I’ve done both with no problem. They do work with you Find My app, but I think it’s just the case that it finds. This is a problem if you’re bad about taking them out of your ears and just leaving them around the house. No handy ping for that. I’ve dropped mine a few times. They seem pretty sturdy - no cracks or other damage.  I love that my jack is now free so I can charge and listen at the same time. I really like these.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I always love my 2nd gen pods, buy this one for trying out the new features.,FACTS:,1. Good apple sound quality: good enough for everyday use and anyone who is not very picky.,2. People says it has better battery life, but I didnt use it all the time so didnt really matter.,3. The touch control is like the wired headphone you have to squeeze it, one for pause, two for next, three for last one.  Good and bad, some people dont like the tapping in the second gen, i actually like the tapping bc when you need to pause it, its faster to do (like you meet someone and need to pause the music), and to squeeze you need two fingers.,4. It hurts my ear even after a couple mins of wearing because the pod size is bigger, especially if you are wearing a hat that covers the ear now in the cold days, the hat will press it even more into your ear, so this depends on the people ear structure but i would say if your 2nd gen fits fine it might be an issue. Plus because of the tighter fit, I feel the surrounding sound is more distorted but not quiet like noise cancelling.,5. Still no volume control on the pod which is disappointing, its not hard to make volume control like touching it up and downs in 2021.,6. The so called spatial audio thing, it only supports certain things which i have not been able to find except the testing lol, probabaly not needed for everyday uses.,7. When the pods are not playing music and it is very quiet around, you can hear some background electric sound which is not in 2nd gen, barely noticable unless its very quiet and not playing.,8. The in-box charging cable is TypeC to Lightning.,Overall a good pod, but I prefer the 2nd gen not only because it's 50 bucks cheaper but overall better imo. Happy New Year yall!

  I was a bit skeptical about buying these off Amazon because I was worried they wouldn't be real. And the packaging was a bit different than usual. But everything appears to be legitimate.,Now onto my complaints about the actual product. I really held onto my First-gen Airpods for a while because they worked great and I didn't see a reason to upgrade. My daughter finally talked me into it because she wanted my Airpods and I have to say I am so disappointed. I feel like the quality of sound was better with my First-gen. And these are HUGE. They do not sit in my ear at all. And with me just sitting at my desk they constantly fall out. So I can no longer wear them while shopping, let alone while cleaning the house, or even exercising. I really regret this purchase so much :( I normally love all of my Apple products but this was just a huge swing and a miss. I am so tempted to get rid of these and go back to my first gen. I can't switch with my daughter though because my ears are much bigger than hers so I know these will go missing very quickly.,I would not suggest anyone purchase these.

  These headphones worked great for me- until I noticed a buzzing noise whenever my headphones were not currently playing music. It's to the point that I've begun the return process- it's too frustrating to have to deal with. I hope anyone else who's bought these has a different experience, but for 178 dollars I cannot justify owning these and suffering through such a grating sound.1

  1. Amazon sells the new iphones with a subscription scheme that was flagged and declined by my credit card.,2. When I first turned on the new phone, the battery level sat at 68% ---something I've never experienced before with any of my previously owned smart phones.,3. I charged the phone to full battery on the morning of 1/4. Made about two hours of phone calls (reasons given below) and downloaded like half a dozen apps. I went to sleep on the night of 1/5, past midnight; the phone showed it had 35% of power left.,I woke up this morning, checked up the phone at around 10 and it has shut off!,Totally defective phone.,Disclosure:, Before I was even fully aware of the battery issue, I had wanted to return the phone since I had to wait for 6months after the device was activated to be able to use it during a trip abroad (I blame Apple and the deals they made with the carriers). But Amazon refused to return the funds to my credit card, telling me they could only refund gift balance even though I used my credit card to purchase the gift balance as the phone purchase was flagged as fishy and I needed it to arrive before my trip.,Regardless, this battery should deter anyone who is planning on purchasing a NEW phone that is truly worthy the 729 full tag price; AND THEY CHARGED THE PRICE OF AN UNLOCKED PHONE.,I would never buy a high-ticketed item from Amazon again.

Harry,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm a sports guy, I don't need a phone with a humongous screen nor expensive, proprietary wireless headphones, which battery lives diminish within time and are unrepairable. So, you can assume I was not happy when Apple --and later, its copycats-- had the ""courage"" to remove the headphone jack from their products. That's why I have been happy with a first-gen iPhone SE that I haven't ""upgraded"" since 2016. I decided to give the iPhone 13 ""Mini"" a chance (it's still larger than regular-sized phones a decade ago, wasn't removing the headphone jack an excuse to give phones more room to attach more technology to them?). Can Apple win a first-gen iPhone SE user? Here's what I think:,PROs,1- Battery Life. Needless to say, it's excellent. Let's see for how long that holds up.,2- Size. Even though is a tad bigger than the first-gen SE, it can fit in your pocket, you can hold it while running, though your grip isn't going to be as good, unless you have big hands.,3- Wireless charging. One of the best new features of phones today.,4- Screen real estate. A lot more than the older phones, even if it's just slightly bigger.,CONs,1- If the headphone jack was a dealbreaker then, this is not going to convert you. I miss it. I posted above why proprietary headphones are a bust, the alternatives are crappy cheap wireless headphones or a dongle.,2- Face ID. In the time of mask mandates, this technology has proven to be hilariously worse than TouchID. Basically useless and unpractical, unless you're driving without sunglasses.,3- Lightning jack. Apple seems to jump the gun when upgrading to technologies that don't improve their products, but they cling to the ones that make them money with their dear lives. Even their iPads have moved on to USB-C.,4- The protruding camera box. Hilariously bad design choice, but it forces you to buy a cover to level the phone on its back.,The verdict is, should you move on from your old, headphone-jack capable iPhone? The answer is, get a battery replacement. The only clear advantage of this new phone is the battery life. Everything else are needless and worse upgrades than the old iPhones.

If anything my connection at home is worse than it's ever been -- and I'm paying more for that!,Con: Placing the cursor is difficult, much more difficult than on my previous Androids (Kyocera & LG).,Con: I cannot set different volumes for my ringer and my notifications.,I'm putting up with the cons for now because I have no choice for the next two years.

Squidslinger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Coming from a 1st gen SE, the improvements are very visible. It handles everything I throw at it. Never realized how dated the SE was until I got the 13 mini. However, I wouldn’t say it is overwhelmingly impressive.,Originally I wanted a 12 Pro or 13 Pro due to the higher RAM in those at 6GB. Had to settle for this mini because of inventory shortage. Used 12s exist but I won’t get something refurbished outside of Apple.,The form factor of the mini is perfect for me but having 4GB RAM in this mini is disappointing. Longevity concerns are there. Apple is good with RAM use but eventually it will be a thing. I’ve seen it happen in the past with iPads, iPods, and that SE. RAM matters if you don’t want to buy again for a long time.,Battery drain is not terrible but it is there. Definitely felt my SE was better with drain. Can’t imagine how bad the 12 mini was if this is improved from that. Regular 13 must be better here.,The lack of a charger is noticeable. Using old chargers are a bit slow. Would have been nice to have an actual decent power one with this.,Also lack of headphone port is an irritant. Got an adapter but, it’s a needless expense. Don’t like Bluetooth stuff. Had some in the past give me headaches when using. Don’t trust it.,Overall I like it. Probably get a solid 5+ years out of it which is the primary reason to go Apple. Better support. But, just kinda feel this 13 mini is a tad underwhelming. If you need this form factor, get it. But if you can go bigger, go Pro. Sadly the Pro colors are blech compared to the 12s but, specs will be better.

  The product I will be doing my review on is an Iphone 13 mini. I had some great expectations when I was buying the phone. A few of my expectations were that the camera would be more clear, and that the phone will have more data. I was expecting more facetime objects and more updated phone settings.,My experience with this product has been so great till today. It was a more positive experience than a negative one. I purchased this pacific iphone for multiple reasons. I do youtube so I needed more space and plus the camera on this phone has great quality. The camera is like a tv frame and very clear. The date never runs out so I can do my youtube things better and smoothly. The youtube things I do are like editing, and making artistic images. Those take a lot of data, but on this phone not as much. I use the item a lot on social media and just basic facetiming sometimes. It's also a great battery on average. My experience has been great with this particular iphone till this day.,In my past with this iphone 13 mini there have been a lot of things that went well with this product. It met the presentation in my product description. The qualities it met was great camera quality, and the clearness in it. The only thing that's probably bad about this product is that it can't get wet. Other than that it's a great product and has great and fast movement. There wasn’t anything that really went bad with this product so far. So therefore nothing really fails to meet my expectations.,Overall this product is very helpful and a great use. This product is a great fit for others to buy it. Its more positive than negative. I have had this phone for like three years so that's another reason why this product is good to have. It's very long lasting with the battery and data.

  I bought the IPhone 13 mini (starlight)and I love it.Upgraded from the 12 mini and the only thing I didn’t like was the battery life on the 12 mini was not that great.love the color ,the design of the phone and camera.It fits perfectly in my hand and doesn’t feel like I’m carrying a brick.

  Not worth upgrading from older model, it's basically the same user experience. If you have a < 3 year old phone keep it or try something else.

  I've had an iPad Mini 4, 5 and now 6. I use them in the cockpit of a small plane, which is one thing Apple is now marketing the Mini 6 for. But I also use it for general tablet stuff; web browsing, watching YouTube, listening to music. I upgraded from the 5 to the 6 specifically for Pencil 2 support. The Mini 5 supports the first-gen Pencil, and while that was great as a first step towards going paperless in the cockpit for me, the way the Pencil 1 charges is just really an inconvenience for my use. I'd constantly get in the plane only to realize my Pencil is dead, and I'd have to just go back to paper anyway. I ended up just always carrying paper and a pen on me anyway, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the Pencil. So being able to have the Pencil 2 constantly stuck to the iPad and charging magnetically was enough in itself to get me to upgrade.,You'd normally expect that any upgraded tech device would have all the stuff you liked about the prior model, but just with more power, features and/or a more elegant design. In the case of the Mini 6, though, I feel like it may be one step forward, two steps back. I'm really happy with the Pencil 2 support but not really with anything else. I may actually be returning it; I'll update this review if I do.,First, jelly scroll is real. I'm always skeptical of complaints like this. They often start with one person who's either overly nitpicky or who just got a defective unit, and then they snowball as others with the same defect or a severe case of OCD write internet comments in agreement. But I was honestly shocked when I turned on my Mini 6, went to a random web page in Chrome, scrolled and saw the effect. It was much worse than I expected, and easily noticeable. It is difficult to believe this got past Apple's quality control.,In reading some other articles about this, it seems clear that Apple's not really lying when they say this is ""normal LCD behavior"", but the problem is that they've mounted the screen controller in the Mini 6 sideways. If you look at the Mini 5, and pretty much any other tablet, you do see some jelly scrolling in landscape orientation, but not in portrait orientation. The Mini 6 is the opposite; it jelly scrolls in portrait but not in landscape. So it is, oddly, a landscape tablet. The weird thing about it, though, is that the controls are not really set up for that orientation, and I sure don't normally use it that way. It's not an efficient way to read web pages; the only thing it's good for is watching videos, where jelly scrolling isn't an issue regardless of how the screen controller's mounted.,The screen is also slightly taller (or you could say ""wider"" if you consider it a landscape tablet), and that doesn't work well in portrait mode either. My Mini 5 shows 6 icons across and they are nicely spaced. The Mini 6, using the same settings (smaller icons), shows 5 icons across and they are weirdly bunched up in the middle. This could be fixed with an OS update but I'd never buy any product based on the promise of a future update. Also, it again is just a weird design decision from a company that's supposed to be all about design.,I compared the screen brightness of the two tablets as well and while they're close, the Mini 5 is very slightly brighter. Again, I made sure they had the same settings - max brightness, Night Shift off, and True Tone both on and off. The Mini 5 screen always wins by a hair.,Add to all that the removal of the headphone jack and I'd say that if you don't need Pencil 2 support, keep your Mini 5 or buy a refurbished one if you're in the market for your first Mini. Save yourself some money too. This was just not a very good update to the Mini line.,Personally, I just need to decide if the Pencil 2 support is enough to overcome all of the Mini 6's downsides. My only viable alternative if I do want the Pencil 2 is the iPad Air, which is $100 more expensive and bigger/heavier... not necessarily an asset in a small plane carrying two people. The iPad Pro also supports the Pencil 2 but it is larger still and even more expensive. It's a tough call for me, but I'd definitely say that most people should get either a Mini 5 (if you don't need the Pencil 2) or an Air (if you want the Pencil 2 and have the space for a larger tablet).

  The new 6th Gen iPad Mini (2021) has several upgrades over the previous iPad Mini, and now looks more like a smaller version of the iPad Air.,Notable upgrades over previous version:,-Screen size: 8.3 in. liquid retina display, previous version was 7.9 in.,-A15 chip:  This is the latest Apple chip, previous version was A12,-Cameras: 12MP rear and 12MP front cameras, previous version was 8MP rear and 7MP front,-Redesigned like Air:  Slightly different shape, no home button, USB-C instead of lightning charger, fingerprint reader on side, volume controls on top, magnetic 2nd Gen Pencil charging on side.,There are also new Pink and Purple colors available, Starlight instead of Gold, and still Space Grey.,If you don't need a larger screen, this iPad Mini is a great option.  Now with the USB-C and  2nd Gen Pencil support like the iPad Air, combined with the A15 chip and Center Stage front cameras, this Mini has some of the best features of the other iPads.  It is a very capable device; it has the hardware to handle everything from drawing with the 2nd Gen Pencil, to watching movies, to gaming, to video calls.  With the latest chip and OS, this is as future-proof as you can get, so this device should last you a long time.,This could be worth upgrading from the previous iPad Mini, especially if you love the 2nd Gen Pencil.  For me, the USB-C and 2nd Gen Pencil support makes it worth the higher price.  The way the 2nd Gen Pencil just magnetically sticks to the side and charges is much easier than the 1st Gen Pencil.  The only thing I wish this Mini had was a 120 Hz refresh screen, but other than that it is just about perfect.  This is probably the most-value-for-money iPad at the moment, and is the one I'm using most often now because of the convenient size.

  Research the word ""jelly scroll"" before buying the 2021 iPad mini 6.  Apple says jelly scrolling on the iPad mini 6 isn't an issue.  A number of recent mini 6 customers say differently.

  I've owned this ipad mini for all of 5 minutes and have come to the first Apple hurdle: No cable to connect it to my Apple desktop or Macbook. The cable they supply fits neither machine. Heck, it doesn't fit my iPhone either!,Which brings me to the gist of my review: I've been an Apple customer for probably close to 25 years but at the same time I purchased this ipad I also bought my first Android device (tablet) to begin the changeover. For the short term I'm a bit anchored to Apple through work (graphics) but find Apple products and policies so overbearing that I'm over the coolaid hype and have begun the switch back to Android.,For example; this cable that isn't supplied. Gotta buy more horribly overpriced/coolaid accompanying items.,Seriously Apple?,Or, wanting to play music in itunes that Apple - for whatever reason - feels like ghosting that day.,Or the inability to remove U2 music from my itunes. For over a decade. FFS apple, if I delete them 100x, I don't want them!,Or, wanting to download my photos and store on my external HD, in .jpg format - and not some Apple invented proprietary format.,Or, the never-ending parade of asking me for passwords. Accept it once, and that's my password until I say it needs to be changed. Not you.,Or, trying to charge/connect my device with a ""non Apple authorized"" cord. Sometimes it works, sometimes it works if I unlock my phone, and sometimes it won't work at all. Just depends. Really Apple?,Or, trying to get virtually ANY Garmin product to play nice with Apple:,Ride a bike and use a Garmin product? Problem.,Own a boat and use a Garmin product? Problem.,Own a motorcycle and use GPX files to navigate offroad? Problem.,The list goes on an on. Just one frustrating interface after another.,The hours of frustration that Apple has forced me to endure in the last few years are what's making me switch. This iPad will be phased out with the tablet over the coming year. My Macbook is a few years old and needs updating but won't be updated with a Mac product, and neither will the Imac or my iPhone. I'm just so over the frustration.,The good thing I guess is that I own a bunch of Apple stock. So all you 16-year old Coolaid drinkers will be helping me as I switch to Android.,Goodbye Apple. It's hasn't been fun.

  I’ve owned ALL generations of WiFi only iPad Minis so I guess this is the first time I’m experiencing a really major change to a device I’ve been using for several hours each and every day for approx the past 8+ years. This change takes some getting used to.,My spouse and I both have iPhones and iPads so we have lightning connector cables scattered all over the house and the cars. In comes the USB-C equipped device which means I have to get appropriate cables for strategic locations where I would need it. I suppose in several years when all our Apple devices get updated to USB-C this would no longer be a problem. Also good that the battery capacity is remarkably better on the mini 6 so less need for plugging it in often.,The display is quite stunning. A definite improvement over the old one. I like the ability to display smaller icons, it helps me find things a bit easier. The fingerprint sensor location is not yet intuitive as I tend to tap the keypad instead to turn on the device. The processor appears noticeably quicker (but not by much).,It’s been about 2 years since my last update to a new device (iPad mini 5) and i’ve forgotten how “painful” the process is, particularly since I have a good number of apps that I use. Logging in to each and every one of them just takes time to get everything working seamlessly again.,Overall the 6 appears to be a substantial upgrade and worth the wait although I consider the mini 5 still holding its own against the 6.

  Nice and fast, good battery life, good cameras.,The jelly scrolling is a noticeable issue and it's weird they oriented the screen in this direction. In general the screen is low quality enough that it was initially causing me eye pain and a headache but just took some getting used to as after ~10 days it's not currently issue.,Pressing too hard on the screen will cause some distortion on the lcd.,Other then resolution, my old Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 (2014) had a vastly better screen, more vibrant, better colors, no jelly scrolling, doesn't have the screen press issue.,The Mini 6 just feels like Apple cut corners but kept the premium price.

Mr.Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have just recently returned the Sennheiser Momentum 3 for their muddy bass.,Did I expect these headphones to sound neutral and tuned like my favorite audiophile headphones? No. In fact I prefer the more easygoing, bassy profile of the M3’s but these beat them where it counts for me overall.,So with those expectations not even being there, I was pleasantly surprised in other ways.,First impressions,Sound:, The bass… is very developed. Perhaps just a shade less in quantity than some of the typical portable headphones that are boosting a bunch of smooshy indistinct low end frequencies (eh ehm beats and most others). But it is much more dense and solid than it’s competition. It could use some more control but it still does better than the headphones I have had a hand on. Good extension as well. No big mid bass hump. Way more slam than the beats solo pro and more volume, but less than the M3, yet more solid.,Mids…are there and pretty clear. Very clean. They sound a little digital and artificial to me. But not much. There is a fast decay. The cups don’t sound like there are a lot of reverberations in them. That chip must be working overtime. They actually sound realistic in balance. Not too lush, not too recessed, but clean with a metallic like timbre to them. A little hard to describe. Hard to fault but they sound pretty good. The upper mids have jumped at me a few times though.,Highs…these have a similar tuning right off the bat to the airpods or beats. Just a little less bright but more detailed. The new beats solo pro are more bright by a little than these to me, but more scooped in the mids. I personally feel they are a little tilted in the highs and definitely spritely. These headphones feel just a little U- shaped. The highs are just a little sharp sometimes, but they hold their character very well and when music gets real busy, they keep from sounding splashy. But they are a little over sharpened to me. Kind of like a picture with the clarity turned up a little to high.,Instrument separation: better than any portable  headphone I have heard hands down,Detail retrieval: excellent for its class,Clarity/Transparency: none better out there for the price that I can say without hesitation. More clear to me than other portables I have tried.,Soundstage: nothing that really impresses me, but it feels relatively spacious for its class. Edit: best in class for sure. I find the soundstage to be really good for a headphone like this. A little more wide than deep but with excellent layering.,Flaws:,- you better get some protection cause those cups are gonna slap together and make blemishes later on. I can only imagine what these will look like after some time.,- if you lay down they feel like they can start to slide a little bit off the ears,- no eq!!! Come on. I just use boost for EQ on these as an app,- I see them trying to be innovative with this stupid cup cover as a case but these should come with a carrying case for all this money.,- Cabin pressure is no joke on these.,Cool things:,- Just tap them to your iphone to connnect,- The volume knob that multifunctions as a pause and play is awesome,- transparency mode is mind blowing. When you put them on, things sound almost identical to having no headphones on. You hear your surroundings naturally.,Verdict so far:,These sound better than: nuraphones, Sennheiser M3’s, Beats solo Pro, Bowers and Wilkins, Sony Mx10004,If I owned an android phone I would still pick these over other headphones for sure, just for the sound and premium build.
"
Garp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are my favorite headphones. When you account for the sound quality, noise cancellation, convenience, comfort and the quality of the build, it makes the price more palatable.,That said, there's no denying that they are expensive. At the same time, they pretty much reside in their own category of headphones. You can easily get better sounding headphones for less than $200 - but those are wired and lack active noise cancelling. You can shop around other Bluetooth headphones with ANC (XM4, QCII35, 700 etc…) but those don't sound as good. Though they certainly don't sound bad and they're a couple of Benjamins cheaper. I firmly believe the Max's ANC is also better than all the previously mentioned gear, though not by much when compared to the XM4s. One very nice thing about the AirPods Max is the ANC causes no hiss at all, not even a little.,But there's just no comparison when you compare the build and comfort. Other Bluetooth ANC headphones feel cheap. Once you handle the faux leather and creaky plastic parts you understand why they're much less expensive. The cloth and foam ear pads on the Max are nearly perfect. They form a good seal, even with glasses, and they’re comfortable for long listening sessions. The aluminum and stainless steel parts feel both durable and even luxurious. The mesh headband distributes the Max's substantial weight very evenly. Moreover, everything is modular and repairable on the Max. The circuit boards, batteries, cups, pads, the headband itself - all disassemble with relative ease so your purchase may just last for decades.,Much has been made of the Max’s weight. In my experience, it’s a non issue. Lounging in the house, washing dishes, sitting at the computer - the weight is fine. BUT, the clamping force is another matter. These things firmly squeeze your head. Initially, I thought I was going to have to return them. Having used them for a couple weeks, they’ve loosened significantly. Possibly, I’ve also acclimated to them.,Transparency mode is amazing. Without doubt, it’s the best implementation I’ve heard. I’ve yet to try out Spacial Audio because until it works with my TV, it’s a gimmick that I don’t care about. I don’t watch movies on my iPhone or even iPad. If you do, you may feel differently.,I do wish I could use them to block out sounds without playing music or white noise. But when not playing audio, the ANC causes too much pressure on my eardrums.,I also wish there were an accompanying App that enabled more intuitive EQ or control of other settings: like perhaps degrees of ANC or better monitoring of battery life and standby. This seems like an oversight on Apple’s part.,Yes, the case isn’t much of a case and it is annoying that they don’t include a cable for wired listening. But those are small things and do not detract from the sound quality, convenience and materials of the headphones themselves.,The ear pads do make my ears warm in my usage. I don’t see how any closed back headphone with a decent seal wouldn’t make one’s ears warm. That said, the warmth doesn’t bother me at all and I don’t feel that they’re uncomfortably hot.,Recently, there have been many reports of condensation and/or sweat accumulating beneath the ear pads on the plastic housing that protects the drivers. Though I don’t doubt these accounts, I have yet to have it happen. After using the AirPods Max for three to four hours, at my desk and around the house, they’re as dry as can be. I don’t know what combination of temperature, humidity, body heat and time causes moisture to appear. All I can suggest is that if you purchase the AirPods Max, try and reproduce the issue with your normal usage. Hopefully, it will be a non issue for you as well.,If you own a couple of Apple devices, say a Mac and an iPhone, the Max’s convenience makes them even more compelling. Normal Bluetooth pairing can be mildly annoying or, depending on your devices, VERY frustrating. There’s no such hassle with the AirPods Max. They just connect. They just switch. They just work.,If you’re cross shopping, there are a couple of Bluetooth headphones that might sound slightly better, but they lack ANC. There are many, many headphones that are both cheaper and sound better, but they are wired and lack ANC. The AirPods Max really are in a different class compared to the $350 range of Bluetooth ANC headphones the market has become used to.,In my opinion, these should not be compared with lesser ANC BT headphones but with the BO H95s. Though I've never owned the H95s, I have held, listened to and envied them. They’re amazing. But they’re also $800 and the ANC is not as advanced. In comparison, the AirPods Max are a bargain, even if they don’t sound quite as nice as the H95s - though they are very close.,I’m very pleased with the AirPods Max. As a complete package, I’m not aware of any other headphones, at any price, that are competitive.,*UPDATE*,This morning I shoveled snow for a little over an hour while wearing the AirPods Max. Admittedly, my understanding of atmospheric physics is pretty low, but I figured my very warm head combined with freezing temperatures affecting the aluminum would likely induce some condensation. But, after shoveling, they were as dry as can be. Again, I'm not casting doubt on the many reports of moisture below the ear pads, but I can't reproduce the effect.

  I was not impressed at all by these. The noise canceling was just alight to the point i wasnt even sure if they were functioning properly. I felt like my old sonys did better at noise canceling. I couldnt find a single thing that justifies the 550 dollar price tag. What a waste of time. I dont understand what they hype was about at all
"
lemme14,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  For Apple's first attempt at over-ear headphones, these are not horrible.  I wanted to like them, and being in an Apple ecosystem, I tried to like them, but until they figure out the battery issue these are a non-starter for me.  Noise-canceling is awesome.  Transparency mode is awesome. I do wish there was some adjustable settings in-between those two but for now it is all or nothing.  These things are heavy compared to most other headphones.  They are comfortable on the ears and the headband (goofy as it looks) is comfortable as well.  The phone call quality is excellent. The audio quality is pretty good as well (not an audiophile, but sounded good to my ears).  The build quality is nothing short of spectacular.,Unfortunately, until they get the battery issues resolved, these are a no go for me.  I cannot understand not having an on/off button, but I could accept that if the headphones properly conserved power, which they do not. Whether I put these things in the case or do not put them in the case, they drain 40-50% a night (about 14 hours from the time I take them off when done with work and put them back on in the morning).  I put them in the case on a Friday night at 100%, did not use them on Saturday, went to use them on Sunday and they were dead.  That is unacceptable.  So, until they allow on of the buttons to turn them on and off, or fix the low power mode so it actually works correctly, I will not consider these useful in any way.  And it's a shame because I really did like them.
"
DJT,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Quality is superb. Fit and finish are pristine. All that comes with a significant weight penalty. Clamping force is a bit much. Weight and clamping force make them uncomfortable for longer sessions.,Sound is just okay. Soundstage for stereo is not wide open and leans a bit cool.,Controls are pretty good and ambient pass through is easy and excellent. Big miss- no power off. Seriously- no power off without the case.,The case is poorly conceived but that should be obvious to anyone that has seen a picture.,Price-  you are paying for premium materials but give up something to Sony and Bose in most of the othe ANC headphones.,What would I do?  Buy the Sony mx4 and a pair of the AirPod pros and have headphones and ultra portable. Then pat youself on the back for making a wide choice. If you can catch both on sale, the difference is negligible considering what you get. If on a budget, just get the Sony headphones.,My 2 cents.

Brother Tao,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Well, I was having difficulty deciding after spending hours each of several days doing research. Most reviewers chose the Sony XM4 because of its much lower price, less weight and proven comfort and reliability. Of course that wasn’t good enough for me because I thought I was a little more audoholic than many so I needed to make a more insightful discovery., I had a Sennheiser several decades ago that was nothing more than a small piece of foam over a small driver and wired of course. It sounded awesome believe it or not so I moved on over to the Sennheiser Momentum 300 which most reviewers rated at or near the top in sound quality and build. It was marked down for modest noise reduction capability and a weight of 300 grams lying in between the Sony at 245 grams and the APMax at 385. Sony is plastic, Apple is metal and fiber and the Momentum is metal and real leather on the ear pads and headband. Apple Earphones are new age sexy, Sennheiser Momentum 300 are retro cool and Sony let’s call modern but plain. Price wise Sony is no higher than $348, Sennheiser is available for $330 down from $400 at introduction in 2019 or so and Apple is $550.,Apple does Apple and I have discovered first hand how brutal they are about forcing you to do what they want. If you try to do anything other than pair them with your iPhone or iPad you will meet roadblocks. They only offer music at 48 kilobits per second so that is all they allow you to listen to in their headphones. If you try to hook up to a device with a higher bit rate it will be reduced before it passes through to your headphones. You can theoretically pay $35 for a special little wire that allows you to connect to a device that would otherwise allow you to plug into a receiver. You can only get it from Apple and even then the 3.5 mmonnection won’t fit into receivers because they take a larger jack which is 6.35., So while they sell adapters that will fit the bill they aren’t Apple approved. In short they don’t just want you to buy and use all their equipment. They force you to use their other products to use the headphones successfully. The weight of the Air Pods Max coupled with what they call clamping force makes them very uncomfortable to wear and don’t even think about exercising or running in them. They will bounce around as you move and I began to feel strain and stress from the fit within ten minutes. Sure, I bought them to entertain myself on long walks but I don’t know where I would put them for the walk home when they are too heavy to wear. You cannot hang them around your neck without choking yourself and then there is the bra/purse like carrier if you was to carry that. Won’t fold in on itself like many of most headphones.,No matter how sexy it looks or how cool it makes you feel to be envied for your coolness the grimace on your face after an hour with these on your head will not attract anyone. I really wanted these as I was telling myself they must have the best sound quality and that is what I am all about. Still  if I don’t like wearing them the music doesn’t help much and I am left with hoping a really cool person or persons will see that I am cool also. I don’t hate Apple and I have an IPhone 10max and an iPad(I bought my first one in April 2010 when the first one was introduced and was the very first truly friendly computer like device) and a MacBook Pro which I won’t replace.,With these headphones they have gone too far with the silly and unnecessary allegiance to Apple required to use it easily. You can search for hours online to find workarounds but half or more of what people suggest doesn’t work. Meanwhile Apple knows all of this and basically gives us the old high hat if we are willing to buy products that compel us to buy only their other products to make them work. Connecting instantly to my iPhone when picked up or put on rather than having to use a typical Bluetooth prompt to accept a connection is not worth enslaving myself just to show aluminum on my ears., I am boxing these up even though they arrived earlier today. I bought them from Amazon because of their stellar return policy and I recommend you do the same if you want to try these. If I kept them I would be doing what many who read my review will do and that is defend and rationalize my choice. That is what human beings do. So if Apple product allegiances are important to you after spending this amount of money on top of all the other products you have bought from them feel free to put it on blast. I know this is a lot of money to spend for many if not most people and I wanted to write something for folks who haven’t had time to do a lot of research and are at a decision point.,I am torn between the Sony XM4(leaving me light headed and looking average) and the Sennheiser Momentum 300(xciting to listen to but making me look my retro like my age). If you want to check out online reviews you will find that deciding who to listen to and trust is every bit as difficult as making your headphone choice. I don’t know who receives what in the way of free products to use or resell or even monetary compensation which might disappear with too much honesty. All I can do is tell you what I think and let you take it into consideration if helpful.,I don’t care about corporations especially large ones as they take care of themselves just fine. I have learned,that there are people who are loyal to and defend corporations and don’t like others criticizing them or their products. In my own life I find that my weakest point is often my best point pushed too far. I think the exuberance for these Air Max headphones and Apples marketing games has likely reached that place with these headphones. Who knows? Maybe I will update my review once I try the Sony or the Sennheiser or both. For now I will be happy to merely take a heavy load off my head!

  These aren’t worth the money. I bought the black pair and they sounded good but good enough to justify the price.

  Wow, just wow!!!! I used to have a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM4 and decided to try these since I’m a complete Apple user. The sound quality on these is absolutely AMAZING!!! You really have to hear it to truly experience it. The design is beautiful, I don’t feel the weight at all and I can even say they’re more comfortable than my XM4s, especially over longer use periods. The Digital Crown makes precise volume adjustment easy and convenient. The transparency mode is the best I’ve ever heard on any headphones, even better than the AirPods Pro. Call quality is incredible. Yes, the smart case is ridiculous but there are plenty of third party options now, including really nice ones from Waterfield Designs (which I got). Yes, they’re also very expensive but I can assure you they are definitely worth the price IF YOU’RE ALREADY AN APPLE USER! (Because great features like spatial audio, automatic device switching, settings adjustments, etc. are only available when paired with an Apple device. They can be paired with other Bluetooth devices but you miss out on all these features.)

  So, you’re in the market for a premium laptop not running macOS (if you are, the answer is simple. The Macbook Air + M1 is elite.),The bigger iPad Pro is better than most ultrabooks, and for two main reasons: The M1 processor, and the versatility of the hardware.,The M1 is either as fast or quicker than any 15W processor, but where it really shines is by outlasting them. A workday that uses 5+ hours of screen on time would kill most Intel-based laptops, and the iPad Pro would have another 4 REAL use hours left in the tank.,Alone, the iPad is a great multimedia tool. With the right accessories, it turns to a laptop replacement. I use the Logitech Combo Touch, but the Magic Keyboard is another good option. I prefer the duality of the Combo Touch; it turns the iPad Pro into a Surface Pro with the case.,The Apple Pencil is the best tool for note-taking, drawing, or alternate input.,The only thing holding back the iPad Pro is the operating system; Apple wouldn’t want to cannibalize the Macbook series. If you don’t use any x86 exclusive workflows (for me, that’s general programming), I think the iPad Pro and its vast series of accessories is the best computer you can buy today.

  Likes,Screen quality, and brightness,Friendly support, so far,Battery life, for the most part, but it's losing it's stamina already,Dislikes - a long list,Apple develpers like old underwear. This software is like cyber-prison and has barely changed at all in over a decade,Voice to text- never satisfying. The word ""too"" in a sentence shows up as ""to"" and when it feels like it, ""too"" or when it should be ""two"" or ""2"" iOS wants ""to"" again.,Dictionary by Apple is a cancel culture nightmare. My literacy in speaking is grammatically correct. Apple's dictionry is not. I do not apprecite a one track thought process in an AI. Apple needs literacy implementations in their AI for voice to text. Android and Windows do this so much better. Apple wants to deny the use of words that have literal meaning in the English dictionary. Improper use of words causing someone to be offended is no excuse to cancel the words that have literal, non-offensive meaning. What if I make the word ""APPLE"" trend, defining it as something offensive to millions of people, and suddenly, those people claimed it was racist when they hear someone say the word APPLE? What then?,This ipad, is a poorly managed device for users due to poor software implementation when compared to Android. No way could demanding users benefit with iOS, after using Android. Android lets me define my own dictionary with words they may have omitted or forgotten. This is how I'm interpretting what Apple wants me to do......to stop saying ""too"" in voice text, and instead say ""also"" which they get right all the time. Well, if there's more than one way to say it correctly, Apple should consider spending more time developing software instead of boasting high end hardware, which is not so high end if it can't manage memory with many apps open. And it does not. Without an option to close all apps at once? Apple responds with BS. Forcing me to swipe multiple fingers for a few to close is all. I've had memory filled with all the apps I use. Tedious closing of apps how Apple requires is a joke and I've needed to close them as I've experienced so many slow downs, lockups, etc due to this very issue.,. This ipad pro could not keep up with a high end android tablet, yet Apple insists it is the fastest processor ever in a tablet. Maybe an iOS tablet, perhaps a single threaded app. I can't respect a device or operating system that limits capabilities like Apple. I don't need a parent to govern how I use a device. Especially a closed minded one.,The hilarity, every time I boot iOS, I see an Apple, with a bite out of it. Was Eve here? Atom should have saved his rib. I'll keep it for facetime with family and emergency backup access to things. I ditched iphone 13 too. Returned and went back to a faster LG v20. Yes, faster. iOS is truly the problem, not sure if they will ever get it. Security on apple devices is not more secure than other platforms as others suggest. Jailbreaking is easy, software hacks are possible, just like any other platform. Just ask a hacker. Rumors of Apple superiority are just that.,Overhyped, over-priced, and iOS is over-the-hill. Like my old underwear from 10 years ago. I should've washed them and got new ones

  I was in the market for a drawing tablet. Tried a intuos which was great except you are drawing on a pad and looking at a screen which takes some getting used to. Then I bought a huion kamvas 16 pro and it was not that great at all. Really cheap, software/drivers are not good.,So I returned it and eventually bought this 5th gen iPad pro. And so far I really really like it. The drawing experience is pretty nice. I would recommend a screen protector as the glass is somewhat glossy and not the best for a drawing surface but it works. And try out procreate.,Have also watched a few episodes of foundation on apple tv and there are alot of scenes worth white on black. Ppl have complained about the bleeding/fuzz effect but I can't really notice it. It looks awesome while watching 4k medium's.,Overall excellent. I wish apple would include a cloth or apple pencil or something for a 1200 tablet but you get what you pay for and it's worth the money.

  This is a 5th generation iPad Pro, 2021 Apple 12.9 inch  Wifi+ Cellular with 256GB. I love this iPad because it is unique, nice, strong, and fast connection. I can use this iPad pro both with wifi and cellular. I insert a mobile sim card into its sim tray and I can be used it as a cellular phone. I can surf, watch youtube, listen to music online, and much more. I can use it anywhere and anytime with the cellular. When I am at home or any place with a wifi connection, it automatically switches the connection to the wifi. This Ipad Pro has a 5G connection. Any place that doesn't have a 5G connection then it will automatically switch to LTE. I have to buy an apple pencil separately, and it works very well. I love this iPad pro because I can do much more with it. Its battery lasts long. It can be used as long as 3 days before it recharges. I purchased this iPad pro on Amazon through Apple Store on Amazon. It is safe to purchase an iPad pro here on Amazon. I received this iPad pro exactly as to what it describes. They shipped fast and they wrapped very carefully. There are no cracks or dents when I received it. On the day of delivery, they required a signature when I received it. I decide to purchase this iPad pro on Amazon because I don't want to wait a long line at the Apple Store. Overall, this is a perfect iPad Pro and I love it very much!

  Look up “iPad Pro blooming” before buying this. It’s pretty bad. Hard to believe that Apple thought this was ok for a “Pro” device.,I’m in a fully lit room, screen brightness is at about 40% and since most apps I use are on Dark Mode, the blooming is constant. The first time I opened the Calendar app, I was shocked.,I mainly use the app Procreate and most of my art has a lot of contrast. Whenever I use the Pencil brush, it looks like I’m also using the Airbrush. Everything glows. It’s crazy. I need the larger format for now but I’m switching as soon as they upgrade to MicroLED or OLED. If not, I’ll eventually go back to the good old 11”.,My suggestion would be to see it in person at the store or check your return window and try it out for as long as you can and see if you get used to it. That said, anything bright POPS and looks amazing.

  Best in Class :,Performance,user interface,longevity (updates),Cameras,very good :,Screen is really good with noticeably deeper blacks compared to previous iPads and blooming is not issue, 95% of time you can't see blooming at all but all in all overall image quality is still not on same level as Galaxy Tab S6/7+ OLEDs but it is relatively close.,4 Speakers are really good sounding,good :,Stylus placement is good but better on Galaxy Tab S6/7 (back side) and because of that you can use more compact sized cases.,Overall : Very Good tablet overall on all fronts and it will last years and you can't go wrong buying iPad pro 12.9 M1 but if you are on tight budget and want really good overall performer for cheaper go and buy Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ or even S6 if you want to use it mostly only for movies and web surfing.

  I owned this iPad for a week to see what may be different from my iPad 6th generation.. other than size, they did the same basic things. I did like it with the larger size but my laptop would do the same thing.,I used the Apple magic keyboard with it and it worked well however, when in Facebook, you lose the use of your imoji’s,Overall it is nice but I didn’t need it just because it was bigger so I returned it and will continue using my 6th generation for now.. wasn’t worth the $1000 + price tag.

  I've avoided upgrading for years because I wanted the ability to CHARGE the phone and PLAY AUDIO through a WIRED connection at the same time. Now, just spent around $1100 for the 256Gb 13 Pro...only to discover that apple didn't see fit to include the wall charger...which they know I will have to buy.,I want to love this phone...but already they have pissed me off. Now I have to make another trip....place another online order...pay more money...whatever. It's stupid and inconvenient. The Ghost of Steve Jobs should haunt those fargin' icehole bastages at apple.

  This phone is amazing! Photos are out of this world. Went from iPhone 8 to this. Wow.,Now for some reason with this buy it was required to buy a cricket phone plan through Amazon. I already have a cricket account so this was stupid. I was just going to buy the phone then cancel the Amazon required cricket account. Figured it would be just a lost $55.00.,But after I made the purchase my Amazon credit card flagged the purchase of the cricket card and canceled payment of it but still processed the phone lol so lucky me. They still sent the card though. So I just threw it in a drawer.

N. Ellis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Since I didn’t buy mine on Amazon, this isn’t a confirmed purchase review, but Apple has released these before they’ve worked out their issues and is expecting customers to pay to be beta testers. When I tried their help people, they told me to try restarting the phone, forgetting the car, all the simple stuff we do first thing. Then they sent a link to reading, expecting me to figure it out on my own. I don’t know about anyone else, but I don’t buy a $1000 phone to help some billionaires work out their bugs. And the naked greed is getting disgusting. Even when you buy the new magnetic charger, they make you buy a $20 plug separately. What?! A charger that doesn’t actually plug into the wall. Are they kidding with this? Apple should be ashamed for putting out equipment like this. We have an Apple house, but I’m ready to switch after this experience.

  If you have an Iphone 12 Pro or 12. Then it's not worth the upgrade as you are getting a very similiar phone. But if you have any other phone you won't be dissapointed. Compared to all other iphones this new phone truly does have an amazing battery life. I on average get 24 ish hours of battery life out of mine. Cameras compared to samsung's are pretty good. Though I would like to make it clear. It's only the software that makes these cameras so good. Without the software, compared to samsung the cameras on this phone suck! This phone has 3 12 mega pixel cameras while samsung's flagship phone has camera's with up 108 megapixels. The thing I love about iphone is ios. And just how easy to learn to use and to continue to use this phone is. In the end I would definetly recommend this phone.

"
no so-called,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The ""slide up from the bottom"" replacement for the thumb button is comically amateurish.,When you slide your thumb up very slightly off-axis, the app screen is moved slightly left or right -- this has no effect at all, other than to annoy the user. iOS is telling you that it understands what you mean, but the developers thought you shouldn't get the desired result.,They kept the moronic misfeature where sometimes, when you swipe, the app is shifted down so it only takes up the bottom half of the screen. The top half of the screen is black. This serves no purpose other than to inconvenience the user.,Taking a screenshot is incredibly awkward now.,All of the things they broke, were broken so they could force you to use face recognition. But face recognition is one of the worst ideas Apple ever had. Face recognition is a nightmarish security hole. It's often awkward and painful to use. It doesn't work with masks. It doesn't work with motorcycle helmets. It doesn't work if the phone is lying flat on your desk. It doesn't work in the dark unless you first turn the phone on.,These people are idiots.

  Love this phone!,1.  You can use your own lightning to USB charger and cords if you don’t want to spring for USBc charger and cord.  Magnetic charger is not necessary.  The phone does charge faster using usbc.,2.  After reading comments about people wishing the phone still had a Touch ID, I was a little concerned.  However I transitioned to Face ID I found that the newer technology was very easy to use and seamless.  I don’t miss Touch ID at all.,3.  Have no opinion on the phone connecting to apple CarPlay yet, but will know in a few weeks when I get a new car.,4.  Photography is a major upgrade from my 6s.  I can even take photos with the sun in my eyes and the photos comes out great.,5.  Connecting to my car’s hands free system was easy, as was connecting to my Bluetooth headphones (an inexpensive pair bought on Amazon, which has pretty good sound for $20),6.  It is fast!,7.  Taking a screen shot is easy.  All you need to do is press the power button and the volume up button at the same time.

  I’m a little perturbed. Received the watch and was unable to set it up because battery is low and there is no way to charge it. They no longer use the USB standard connector. It is now a smaller connector and of course all the 30 odd chargers I have around the house none will work.  I know the watch will be great once I get it charged.  But just be aware!

  I bought the SE since this was my watch Apple Watch and I wasn’t sure how efficiently I would use it. But after having it I realize that it fills so many gaps! I love the watch faces, one shows time and with a simple swipe the next face shows temp, altitudes, weather, battery life, heart rate, and a compass. I use it while kayaking since the workout app has a row setting, as well walking, running, and literally everything else. One of my favorite aspects of the watch is the noise app that monitors your environment’s decimals for damaging amounts of noise. I work in a restaurant and the app has alerted me to harmful noise levels multiple times and each time I distance myself.

  I had the original Apple Watch and decided to upgrade. There is not a big difference but the battery life is better and I like the larger face. I change the band to one with Velcro as I can make small adjustments for the best and most comfortable fit. Like having the fall detection and being able to call for help easily.

  It's a great watch. I use it to track when I'm walking the dog and general exercise. It tells you when you've been sitting too long and asked me if I'd fallen one time when I'd bumped it.

  This is about my 7th smart ""watch"". I've have a couple of Fitbits, a Jawbone, a Zenwatch 3 (prettiest of the bunch), a Samsung Galaxy, and an Amazfit Bip (good watch for the money). I've basically got a smart watch museum. I got the Apple Watch because, honestly, I'm getting older and I wanted the fall detection and health features. I've had it for a couple of weeks and here's what I think, from bad to good.,1. Battery life sucks. It'll get through one day, but that's it. The Bip would last for 3 weeks on a charge.,2. The screen isn't great in direct sun. It's better than some others, but doesn't hold a candle to the Bip, which was somehow reflective in bright light, sort of like a Kindle.,3. The sleep tracking is ok, about what you'd expect from a movement detecter, but the app for it isn't very good. Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now.,4. It has some very nice watch faces, with custom complications. Best of the bunch.,5. Very comfortable to wear. The big stem doesn't get in the way at all.,6. The health features work great. It accurately tracks you pulse, and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand. I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.,7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.,It has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun. Lots of other things. The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it's unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were.

  It took me a while to decide to upgrade my apple watch. Hard to justify a smart watch over $300, in my opinion, however, my Series 3 was so slow, took forever to install an update, no space for apps/data storage, etc...,I got a Fitbit Charge 5 as a temporary place holder, tried to convince myself I liked it more than an Apple Watch, ultimately I came back to Apple.  I opted for the 41mm Series 7 because I didn't need an extra 4mm for another $100.,It moves so seamlessly, fast to charge (lightyears ahead of the series 3), lots of new watch face templates to choose from, beautiful edge to edge display. Of course you can choose to have ""Always on Display"" but that will quickly deplete your battery life.,Ultimately, just get the upgrade that is within your budget and you won't regret it!

  I ordered this on 11/26 and received it at 6am on the 27th (gotta love rush overnight shipping being a prime member).,This was an upgrade for me coming from the Apple Watch 3 and then going to Whoop for a year and a half. Ultimately decided back on Apple for the smart watch features.,Few things to note:,1. The screen is a lot bigger if you’re used to a  41 or 42mm. Personally love the bigger screen but I also have a bigger wrist so it fits very well.,2. The watch does NOT come with the “butt” part of the charger you plug into the wall. If you have a newer charger for your apple devices (Ie when I got my iPad earlier this year I had gotten a full charger that I can swap the wires out with this) you’re all set. If not, go buy a charger when you’re purchasing this,3. The watch, for me at least, was closer to 90% charged so wouldn’t have been a huge deal if I had to Amazon prime or run to the store for a charger,4. Features are advances compared to the 3 but still have a lot of similarities.,5. Box comes with two band sizes. Small and then medium/large,6. The packaging is very well done. I was impressed when I opened it up,Overall I’m happy with this purchase (I knew I would be) as I spent probably 2 months comparing the new Apple Watch to the Garmin to find what would be best for me and my specific needs.

  First, I just want to say that it DOES NOT come with a charger block for the USB type C, so if you don’t already have one, buy it along side it as I had to take a trip to two different Walmarts and a target to find one.,Next, I highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend you measure your wrist and go by the recommended wrist size that apple suggest for each watch. I’m fairly okay in terms of body weight sitting at 210 lbs and dropping with a height of 6’1.  My wrist size was measured to be 210mm so it was recommended that I go for the 45mm version but instead I decided to look at reviews on YouTube and I saw that majority of them recommended the 41mm version as the 45mm was “too bulky and was like wearing a TV screen on their wrist” so because of that I went for the 41mm. When I placed it on my wrist with the band, it felt like I was wearing the smallest watch ever, it felt as if I was trying to put on a watch made for children. Then I went to my friend’s who had a 45mm Apple Watch and tried his on and it fit perfectly, lesson learnt, listen to the manufacturer instead of random people in a video.

  It took six hours to set up,I am a techy electronics engineer.  I have dozens of patents in electronics and have written thousands of lines of computer code, in three different programming languages.  But this watch is quite a challenge.,When I tried to pair the watch to the phone, the phone said I must update the phone to OS 14.8.1.  Yet I have always had ""automatic updates"" ""on"" in the phone menu.,So I spent a half-hour updating to OS 14.8.1.,I tried to pair the watch to the phone again and the phone said my OS must be updated.  But I had just updated it.  So I called apple support.  They directed me to update my OS to 15.1.  Why was I previously directed to update to 14.8.1 when that was obsolete?  Updating to 15.1 took an hour!,Next when I tried to pair the watch, the message on the phone says that I need to charge the watch.  I examined the watch charge cable and it must plug into a USB ""C"" charger which is not included with the watch.  Do you have such a charger?  I didn't even know such chargers existed.  I have ten chargers, including several made by apple, and they all only accept the original USB plug, called USB ""A"".,I recall reading a few weeks ago that apple was no longer including chargers.  I thought, that's ok, we all have lots of chargers.  But nobody has USB ""C"" chargers, they are very new.,So I ordered a USB ""C"" charger.,The charger arrived I started the pairing process.  But the phone stuck for 30 minutes during the pairing process so I called support.  They couldn't get it to work by the standard way, which is to update the watch software, so they opted to install without updating the watch software.  That worked with lots of hand holding and took about 45 minutes,All together I spent about six hours getting the phone to work.,Has apple lost their mind?

  The Apple Watch 7 is nice. Especially if you are upgrading from a version that is several years old.,But beware, it only comes with a charger that is USB C. So if you don’t already have a usb power brick or old Watch charger, you have to buy that and won’t be able to charge your watch

  This is my first Apple Watch. I feel incredibly stupid for waiting this long to buy one! This thing is SO amazing! I decided to go with the Graphite Stainless case. It’s certainly more expensive than the aluminum models which are also super nice. The watch is very easy to setup and connects nearly instantly to your IPhone. The apps and available customizable watch faces are nearly limitless. The 45mm fits my wrist perfectly - it’s not too big. It looks amazing! Make sure to order a USB C charger when you order your watch. I’m not sure why it’s not included. Other than that it’s perfect!! Absolutely love it. Probably one of the best little things I’ve ever bought for me!

  So far. Got the watch. Turned it on. When it tried to link to my Iphone it said I needed to update my Iphone. So I updated my Iphone which took hours. By that time the watch had run out of the factory charge. Dead watch. They give you a magnetic charger which has a USB C male end which fits nothing I have. Seriously! I paid over $700 for this thing and they couldn't include a real charger?  So, at this point it sucks.

  I’m upgrading from a series 1, so it is a completely different watch. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Most of the heart monitoring functions only work with people older than 22 which is frustrating for me especially since I paid for the watch, so I should get access to all the features. Nonetheless, I really like the starlight Apple Watch and band. It’s very subtle and nice to look at. Hopefully braided solo loops get a sale soon bc I really would like one. It is a pain that they don't give power bricks, but this is the new age. I highly suggest you purchase many usb c power bricks and switch all cords from usb a to usb c. Anker has great ones and you can always find deals for them.

  the magnet on the armband is too weak. the armband keeps slipping loose and ends up dangling on my arm every 20 minutes. and this is just while walking around the home or office. this band is absolutely unusable when exercising. the watch slips right off. i paid about $300 extra for a pretty armband, and it turned out to be a complete turd. i will be returning it and getting one of the base models

  Does not come with the a charger for their new “C” cable. Does not work with older USB chargers so you need to order the new charger.

  I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.,My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.,A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.,Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.,Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.

  I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.,No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.,Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.

  I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

  I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.,I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.,It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.,Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).,Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

  The battery lasts forever and its fast. My last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too.,The M1 does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total. These two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now I have $200 worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk.,How is a 2020 Mac not compatible with dual monitors but my 2005 HP works great with the same monitor setup?!? I really can't get past that.,Get the intel version with 4 USB ports and you can use it in your Covid home office out of the box.

I was disappointed that there are no USB ports or CD player. I spent about $65 at Best Buy and got an adapter that works very well!!!

mkidwel2,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out.

  picture/video quality is outstanding, battery life as advertised,i watch prime videos-- with my 10 year old ipad or cheap chrome book never a problem--however with this, there is typically an add that appears before the video, a few seconds into it is the ability to skip it--however once i chose to skip this ipad cannot make the video connect, just gives me the ball that goes round and round no video connection. through experimentation i found i could use the old chromebook to make the connection to the video, then use the ipad to go back to prime and pick it up at that point. which is ridiculous

  It’s an okay device but touchscreen doesn’t always respond and for the price you can’t even upload files and edit Office Excel or Word without a monthly subscription and I already own the Full Version of Office, but you can’t get those types of files on the device via usb c which can be done on a real computer. This is 100% NOT a desktop replacement as they advertise.

W. J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Quite frankly, decided to try something Apple, after my family all started using iPhones and iPads.  Reviews were mixed in preference, so that was not much help to me. I also liked the screen ratio (not so wide-screen movie-centric) for a tablet.,Apple is quite a bit more expensive, especially with the Apple ""pencil"" which is included with. I did the purchase based on plan to keep and use for a few years. In other words, I paid for iCare, got 256 GB version, cellular connectivity, and kept in mind the higher resale value of things Apple.,Going in, I was expecting to have a learning curve, and was braced for it. My initial judgement was that I would probably be mostly satisfied with either one.,After using for a couple of weeks I have to stick by my initial assessment. Apples biggest faults (in my opinion) are that they are so restrictive in their policies.,More Later,1-26-22,-Yes, still do not like Apples proprietary tendencies.,-Hardware is pretty good, but slow to charge (no matter what charger) and battery does not last that long.  My experiences with Samsung charging and battery were FAR better than with the iPad.,-Interface is neither intuitive or particularly easy.  I use it every day and it is a constant learning process.  Not only must you memorize countless gestures, but you must be very precise in doing them. Result is a quick gesture often means I have to do it over again.,- I love being able to get pictures and use Facetime with my Apple-centric family, but other that that I am wishing that I had gone with the Table S7+.

  I've owned iPads in the past but never kept them for long. The M1 performance paired with new features like touchpad/mouse support and iPad OS, this is good enough for everything I need to do for personal use. I'm a software engineer and use a MacBook for work, but I don't really need any PC software for my personal life. iOS/iPad OS apps can handle everything else. I also love the design these have had for the past few years. I've been in love with the non-curved edges since the iPhone 4.

  a great tablet with more than enough power for most users. nice build quality and form factor as you would expect from apple. combined with the magic keyboard, this iPad is a joy to use. the only issues ive had is that it doesn't connect to wifi after wake from sleep but that is most likely due to a software issue and should be resolved shortly. my unit had a small chip on the right side on the bezel but it doesn't affect the iPad in anyway. also, the unit runs a bit warm and battery life is a bit worse than i expected. makes me wonder if i should have gotten last years model instead.

  This ipad was sold as a 2021 Ipad pro, and it’s actually a 3rd gen from 2018!! The listing even says “2021” in the headline while stealthily avoiding saying what generation it is. Which I’m sure it will do what I want but I paid freaking $1,300!!! They are available all over the place for half that. I’m super disappointed in this lie of a sale and working on getting rid of this device.

  I’m a little perturbed. Received the watch and was unable to set it up because battery is low and there is no way to charge it. They no longer use the USB standard connector. It is now a smaller connector and of course all the 30 odd chargers I have around the house none will work.  I know the watch will be great once I get it charged.  But just be aware!

So now I need to go buy a charging block for the other type (USBC?) of plug just to charge this.,Kinda lousy way to sell something.

  I bought the SE since this was my watch Apple Watch and I wasn’t sure how efficiently I would use it. But after having it I realize that it fills so many gaps! I love the watch faces, one shows time and with a simple swipe the next face shows temp, altitudes, weather, battery life, heart rate, and a compass. I use it while kayaking since the workout app has a row setting, as well walking, running, and literally everything else. One of my favorite aspects of the watch is the noise app that monitors your environment’s decimals for damaging amounts of noise. I work in a restaurant and the app has alerted me to harmful noise levels multiple times and each time I distance myself.

  I had the original Apple Watch and decided to upgrade. There is not a big difference but the battery life is better and I like the larger face. I change the band to one with Velcro as I can make small adjustments for the best and most comfortable fit. Like having the fall detection and being able to call for help easily.

  It's a great watch. I use it to track when I'm walking the dog and general exercise. It tells you when you've been sitting too long and asked me if I'd fallen one time when I'd bumped it.

Heidi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was on the fence about getting the pro's or the new AirPods because my original AirPods have been dying on me for a while. I was seriously considering getting the AirPod 3's because I was not sure if I would like the style of these, the noise cancelling and the fit compared to the originals. All I can say to myself now is whyyyy did I wait so long?,I use my AirPods everyday at work and at home on my phone and my computer. The original AirPods never stayed in my ears and more so recently. They are instantly uncomfortable and I am constantly fidgeting with them. These ones I am still working out the fit (I cannot pull hard enough to get the standard size off to try a smaller one) but with the in ear tips they are 100x more comfortable. They are quite a bit bigger so stick out of your ear more so they get in the way when laying down or on your side but not super noticeable for most things. They are so noise cancelling I have NEVER heard anything so silent. But when you wear them in transparency mode you can still hear just fine. This was something I was a little worried about since I did not want to be dead to the world.,Bottom line - if you're on the fence GET THEM. You won't regret it. Especially right now with the sale price, so worth it.
"
Rocco H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  ALL you have to do is read/do your research. If it was a new AirPods Pro don't you think there would be like....a ""2"" or something after the name? The ""New"" is describing the MagSafe charging case which you can clearly see marked on the box or if you put it on a wireless charger, not the AirPods themselves. Who is complaining about ""no charger in the box"" in 2021? Clearly someone living under a rock!
"
Elee Bot,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So first of all, these are the real Apple AirPod Pros, I was a bit skeptical because this is a new posting by Apple but is only because the case is now MagSafe charging capable, the active noise cancellation is so good that it’s scary, I feel like I’m my own world, the Audio is great and loud, very comfortable and automatically got setup, if you have the money… go for it! I love these.

Rodrigo Navarro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Let me just say these are cleannn! They are made in Vietnam, which is a fact, because they do have assembly lines in Viet. Quality is not compromised and they are legit.

Reveluv SC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Upgraded from the airpods 1 to this since it was on sale for Black Friday and it was worth it. The sound on these sounds like headphones surround sound, way better than most headphones and earbuds I use. Great bass, clarity, and the spatial audio and noise cancellation is decent and a bonus. Also the “new” in the title is because it has the magsafe charger case. Get these airpods you won’t regret it.
"
Juan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you guys are doubting this or not sure if they are authentic, we'll I'm here to say that they are the real deal. It's 100% worth it. This model, comes with the newer magsafe wireless charging case. It comes with the Airpods pro, a charger cable, and a interchangeable ear tips of 3 sizes. The only thing it doesn't come with is the charging adapter brick. The sound quality is great and so it the noise cancelation. The noise cancelation doesn't block out every sound. If you've never had noise canceling earbuds, the sensation is very weird when you put them on as it goes really quiet out of no where. The good thing Is you can turn off the noise cancelation if it bothers you. They also feel kind of weird inside of the ear because they go deep to create a seal for better quality. If you are on the fringe about buying these, I highly recommend them!
"
Vanessa Gonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve always been an Apple user and never thought as to why I wanted AirPods sine the original headphones really hurt my ears. Since they came out with the pros I’ve been wanting to try them and finally got myself a pair with my chase rewards and these are very comfortable and so easy to sync with your phone. I carry them in my purse everywhere I go and the noise cancellation is great especially at work. I use them around the house a lot but not enough complete cancellation to not hear the vacuum because that is very loud obviously. The silicon tips still made the headphone slip out my ear but I purchased some memory foam tips to replace them and they stay perfect and fit in my case perfectly. I would have never spent that much $ on headphones for myself but I do enjoy them very much and would never go back to my other headphones unless I forgot them at home. Definitely worth my reward points. You can find the cutest cases off Amazon too!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I recently took a new position where I would be flying weekly.  I went online and started reading reviews about the best noise canceling headphones, Apple constantly ranked above the Bose and Sony models.  So I dove in.,I am really glad I did.  What Apple does not market is how well these integrate with an iPhone.  Bluetooth that finally works like Bluetooth should.  You put them on your head and the pair automatically.  No searching in menus, no “forget this device”. None of that.,Now, the sound is great.  Period.  Moving on to function.,If you travel these are for you.  The noise canceling is perfect.  During a flight, the plane just disappears.  It is completely silent.  While walking through the airport you can listen to music and activate Transparent mode and hear all the announcements.  If someone texts you, music dims, Siri announces the persons name, and reads the message automatically.  No stopping to dig out your phone and look at the message.  And, you can reply hands free.  Great, great, great when your hands are full.  I wear these for 8 hours straight and do not take them off, extremely comfortable.,There are a lot of other features that work with the iPhone that are great, you just have to experience it.  But them, 10/10.

photog56,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am going to forego the normal discussion regarding how much they cost and if it is worth it. That's seems to be strictly individual to me. They are expensive and I will leave it at that. I also own the Sony XM4's, which will I compare them to.,Comfort. These are heavy headphones and definitely taking some getting used to.  In addition, if you have a large head, as do I, the clamping force on your head may be a dealbreaker for you. I have learned to adjust the position on my head to mitigate that. Unlike many headphones,  you will spend a little more time adjusting them for comfort. The Sony XM4s are definitely more comfortable.,Controls. The two button controls are simple and easy to use which is the same setup on the Apple watch. I prefer this setup to the touch controls on the XM4, which can be hit and miss. You can adjust the direction for volume up or down based on what is more intuitive to you.,Sound. The sound is absolutely amazing. Hands down the best I have ever heard. While listening to music is often discussed, not much is said about using them with AppleTV which is actually the primary reason I purchased them. Listening to a movie or TV show through the Airpods Max is simply unbelievable.  Spatial audio is a brilliant audio enhancement.,Battery life. I have been able to get the 21 hours they advertise. Battery life is not nearly as robust as the XM4s however. Much has been made about the fact that they can't be turned off. I have not found that to be an issue, although it does force you to put them in the case in order to put them in sleep mode. Noice cancellation is excellent.,Miscellaneous. Yes, the case is ridiculous. I purchased a more viable case for. It does not come with a charging adapter (brick). That was a not a real issue for me. I was far more upset when they shipped iPhone 12s without them. I find them too heavy to for exercising. I use the XM4s for that. I do not use them for business meeting calls (Zoom, etc.), so I have no opinion on that. If you are going to purchase AppleCare, purchase it through Amazon. Adding it with Apple  is a hassle if you purchased them from Amazon.,Summary. The construction of the Airpods Max is something to behold. If you are an iPhone, Apple Music, AppleTV user, you will  definitely want to consider these. I was on the fence for awhile because of the price, but after using them I have no regrets. I give them 4.5 stars. The weight prevents me from giving it 5 stars.

  BEWARE: the Space Gray color is non returnable new or used! All other colors are returnable as of the writing of this review!,Bought these used. I know! What a silly thing to do right? Anyway. They arrived and what do you know? They won't turn on. Went through all of the Apple troubleshooting steps, talked to the Amazon tech support rep, and still no dice. Finally get to the Amazon customer support team and they say too bad, you have to deal with Apple.,Kind of inconvenient, but okay, I guess that's fine. Get in contact with Apple and come to find out the serial number on the product and the serial number on the box don't match. Weird.,No help from Apple unless I reach further into my pocket to fix them at my own expense and wasted 2 hours on the phone with Amazon.,I have a $450 paperweight. Maybe someone from Amazon will see my review and figure out how to make sure I have a working product.,But hey! They fit really well on my head! I'm sure they're great if they weren't broken out of the box.,4/5 fit,0/5 customer service
"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First the good. They have pretty good controls and connectivity. The noise cancellation is one of the best. Build quality is very solid like almost everything Apple makes. Very long battery life lots of use out of one charge.,Now for the bad, they’re too heavy for the head to be worn for a long time. They will start to feel uncomfortable after ten minutes of using them. 3-D tracking sound is almost nonexistent to my ears… Maybe I got a A defective one, I don’t know! The sound seems a bit too bright on the meds and high for me. They can get fatigue quickly. The base is good but not great. I was a bit disappointed in some of the areas expecting maybe too much from this product with the high price tag! Overall it’s a OK  to good Product but it’s deafly not worth the money.

  These are good (not amazing) headphones.,First the good:,1) the noise cancelation is EXCELLENT,2) the ambient sound mode is EXCELLENT,3) they sound very good,Now for the bad:,1) they're uncomfortable to wear.,2) after 30-45 minutes my ears are hot and it's too uncomfortable to wear.,3) no way to know how much battery you have (or don't have) without looking at the battery widget,What I've found is that I actually prefer other headphones more. Even with Apple. My Bowers & Wilkins  PX7 sound great and are way more comfortable.,That being said, as of this writing (July 2021) I don't know if Apple is going to release an update to enable hi-fi with these headphones and Apple Music.,I'd say buy these if you're heavily sunk into the Apple ecosystem and don't plan to ever wear your headphones for more than 45 minutes.

  The build quality of AirPods Max as to be expected from Apple. I love Apple. After over a year of use on my AirPods Pro, I decided to try these, after reading the reviews! The first thing I noticed, I kept looking for a way to turn up the volume as these were extremely underwhelming on highest volume! I noticed that these were minimally higher in volume than my AirPods Pro and I could not believe what all the reviews said about these being so much louder than the AirPods Pro, in fact the AirPod pros work much much better as they go inside the ear canal and are not over the year. I truly thought I was going to get a much louder crisper music than my AirPods Pro in which I was severely disappointed. I tried these with music and movies last night and immediately put them back in the box to return them. Now, if you do not have any AirPod pros then yes this would be an upgrade from the regular AirPods but that is really about all. thank you.

  These are great earphones, but the instruction manual is 3 1/4 x 3 1/4 inches. The headings are in very small black ink. But the actual instructions are in tiny grey ink that is impossible to read. I was able to get it going by Googling the instructions, but it was annoying.

  Some context: I am not an audiophile but do appreciate high fidelity sound and true noise cancellation.,These guys are incredibly overpriced and while designed really well, the sound quality itself was a bit of letdown for me. Before buying the AirPods Max my primary headphones were AirPods Pro and Bose QC35 - two of the most common ""daily drivers"" I'd assume. So when trying out the AirPods Max, I was expecting a much higher quality sound, but I personally couldn't tell a distinct difference from the QC35.,They're heavy. Not the best for walking and listening.,I work from home and always try to pace around the house on calls that don't require me to be on screen. Walking around with these guys takes some getting used to, to the worst be totally a noticeable difference in weight as compared to other competitors.,It comes with an oddly shaped case that is kind of a pain to have to carry along since the headphones have to be in the case to turn off. This is definitely a very ""Apple"" move, but I'm failing to find any logical reason they'd plan it this way - could it just be a ridiculously bad oversight?,The volume control knob is nice. I often turn it in correctly. Definitely worth checking the settings right away and adjusting the knob and button actions.,Bottom Line: The physical construction of these is incredible. They feel luxurious but a little heavy. The noise cancellation is decent. But the sound is not impressive, in my opinion after about 2 months of use.  So if you want a physically beautiful, high quality set of headphones to just keep at your desk, and don't mind just ""decent"" sound and a wildly high price, buy these. If not, check out Sony, Bose, etc for cheaper premium headphones that will deliver similar if not better sound quality.

  Tl;dr = Great ANC, cold to the touch, sleek design, spatial audio. About $200 more than comparable ANC headphones with inferior designs and less bells and whistles.,The reason I'm leaving overall 3/5 is because of the persistent battery issues. I'm sure if there was a physical on/off button this issue would be resolved, or if the case was more formidable and functional than a bra strap. When I put them in the case, the next day I lose 50% or more battery, even when they no longer appear as an active device (swiping all the way left to the widgets screen on the latest iPhone software). A temporary workaround appears to be factory resetting them. Simply unacceptable on a $500+ pair of headphones. Hoping a future firmware update resolves this.,I didn't encounter the condensation issue inside the ear cups that some others described on social media and tech blogs, but I guess it goes to show you that these are the sort of issues you might encounter as an early adopter of a new product.

  So first things first in full disclosure, I am an Apple fan so that may influence my review.  Like most folks, the pricetag of these headphones is really high.  If I wasn't so deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem I may have passed on these. Anyway, I found a new pair on Amazon and the packaging was damaged so saved about $40 and decided to give them a whirl.,Likes:,- I haven't owned over-the-ear headphones in many years so didn't know what to expect.  But they sound amazing!  I own a pair of AirPods Pro's that I haven't listened to in a while and I thought they sounded great before I had my Airpods Max.  I just used them and wow, they sound terrible in comparison.,-  The design is all Apple - high quality and while a little heavy they are very comfortable.  I have worn them for several hours and haven't experienced the condensation issues that others have.  We live in a dry climate so maybe that's a factor?,-  Noise-canceling is simply amazing.  I have a Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker and made some coffee last weekend and while it makes great coffee, it's really loud.  I was wearing my headphones and had to check to make sure I turned them on since I heard nothing.,- Call quality is great and the transparency mode makes you think you are not wearing headphones.  Excellent,Cons,- Ok, the case works fine when you are at home but I did buy a more rugged case for traveling.  For the price, a better case should be included.,- Cost as noted is high - but after just listening to my Airpod Pros, the quality is way better and probably justifies the cost.,I have only had the headphones for a few weeks which is why I gave them a 4 out of 5 since my experience is somewhat limited.  I am traveling quite a bit over the next few months and will be using them a lot so I'll share more thoughts down the road but so far I am impressed.  Also, if you are considering these headphones, check out Brian Tong's review on YouTube.  It's long (almost one hour) but is worth checking out.

  It's an ipad, screen is beautiful, battery life is great and you can browse the web. Switching between Keyboard, Touch and Pencil is easy but can be finicky depending on the application. For about 95% of people they will be able to do everything they need to do on a tablet and what they'd need from a laptop so it justifies the price. If you already have a mac laptop and you travel it's a must buy for the screen extension, essentially giving you a dual monitor setup where ever you go.,There are a few things you cannot do though which bothers me. With the switch to M1 chipset, which is the same as the macbook air and MBP 13"" I was hoping it'd be closer to a laptop replacement like the surface provides but since it's still running ipadOS there are holes. There's no full featured IDE, there's one that support very specific languages or ones that are cloud based but local development can't be done unless you want to do it in a notepad. The Excel apps I've used on it are weird and limited, you can view already created spreadsheets but ones that I tried to create new were a giant pain to get going (trying to do column/row formatting in Google Sheets was a terrible experience. The browser apps for both of these issues solve the problem but if you're in the car or public transit trying to get work done it's not really possible and for that reason I regret not getting a cellular model. Hopefully Apple extends the OS to better support the features for this (which it obviously can handle from a hardware perspective now), but I doubt it since it'd draw away from the laptop market. Time will tell.

PV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Like many, the iPad has replaced many of my day to day computer use. Each generation of iPad I’ve purchased has been extraordinary , and this is by far my favorite. The large screen allows me to read or create with ease—the Gen 2 Pencil is extremely responsive compared to older models with the Gen 1 Pencil.,I forgot how nice it is to have the extra speakers on the pro model. A definite plus when watching movies or listening to music.,I use a glass screen protector, making the surface slick to the touch, and allows my fingers to easily glide with use. Not sure if this is due to the screen protector or the particular app, but while playing a few games, I’ll touch on a selection but it either lags or doesn’t respond.,Battery life lasts longer than other models I’ve owned, and I find myself charging after 8-10 hours of normal usage. Charging is a lot faster using the USB C charging cable vs the previous lightning models.,The only downside to this iPad is the weight. I expected it to be heavy since the screen size is large, but with a few months of usage now, I can feel the fatigue in my arms and wrist from daily use.,All in all I’m extremely happy with this model of iPad.

Mike ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This tablet memory and video performance is stellar. Process speed is typical apple. Just plan awesome. The screen size makes the unit a bit heavy and bulky. You cant hold the unit well without a good protector case as its slippery to hold with a big screen size. But...to get such video capability you have to have a big screen which means a bulky size...however that's my only complaint...bulky...otherwise you will love this units capability . Plenty suitable to use as a substitute lap top or note book computer.

  I use this tablet as a pilot to display navigation, flight arrival/departure and approach procedures.  This is called the ""electronic flight bag"".  This apple product replaced an Android device that consistently failed.  Reliable performance is the most important consideration.  I am very pleased with its performance.  This tablet is sterile with only one application (Garmin Pilot).  No lockups, application freeze, display not responsive are issues with the Android.  I've never used an Apple product before.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
"
Paul,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  While this is a nice product, Apple hasn't given it the abilities that others are wanting like being able to extend the ""desktop"" to another monitor (or maybe 2). Also, it would be great if we could use the same apps from the Macbook Pro on it.

  I am anything but an Apple fanboy. Prefer and use Windows Desktops and laptops….but for tablets…this is my best option. Syncs photos and apps with my iPhone 12 max pro on iCloud. A perfect email, web surfing and photo editing device. Long battery life. Nice clear audio. Almost a small laptop substitute. Needs a case, and very good ones available for $20-$30. No real need for a separate keyboard or touchpad. Apple Pencil 2nd gen works perfectly with it. Good cameras. I’d buy again.

Karine Towner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've always wanted an iPad Mini, but held off since I knew one day they'd release it as a fullscreen model, which they finally have. And since it came in my favorite color (purple) I knew i Just had to have it, even if I already have an iPad Pro. As an artist and writer, and I also love to read history books, I knew this little thing would be a great companion alongside my Pro. I heard of the jellyscroll problems but still decided to get it, and in my general opinion, it is really up to you as the buyer to decide is the jellyscoll problem is a big issue. Yes, it is there, and I notice it, but it does not bother me one bit. It's only really noticeable when YOU decide to take the time to notice it. Everyone has their own views on how much it bothers them, and with me, it does not. I would recommend stopping at an Apple Store (if you have one near) or a store like Best Buy to see it first hand and test out the screen to see if it is a reason for you to get it or not. I don't think this should be any reason for someone to not get it or even return it like some people have. Despite the flaw, it is still a cute little thing to have with me, and would make a great companion for you for your own needs. Don't let jellyscroll prevent you from getting it. And if you truly don't like it, then you have the choice to return it. But for me, its great, and pretty much exactly what I wanted

  After iPad Pro and iPhone 13 pro with 120hz display it feels not good as a pro model, but after a few day it’s ok, and don’t see different anymore. Super comfortable to use iPad with one hand and to carry with you whatever you go. It’s like a note. I wish apple will make iPad Pro mini in a future cause this size it’s just amazing!

Benny N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This iPad is amazing! The size is perfect for when I’m on the go or just chilling at home. I’m a motorcoach driver, so I need something to do when I’m away. About the jelly scroll issue, I can kind of see it, but it doesn’t bother me at all. I think people who are bothered by it have owned an iPad or tablet all their life and they’re not used to the left side slightly lagging. The last time I had an iPad was the 2nd generation one, and that one crapped out several years ago. So having a brand new iPad with updated software is just a blessing to me.

WC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My first concern was the jelly-scrolling issue...  I see it, but it's so minor that it doesn't bother me in the slightest.  Everything else about the iPad mini is great.  So far, I'm using about 18-19 gb of memory, so I have plenty of gb left.  I do wish Apple offered 128 gb memory as an option.  I really enjoy the tablet for email, surfing the net, Netflix, YouTube, playing a few basic games, reading books or news articles.  It may take you a few days to get used to the operating system but now it's second nature to me.  Overall, I'm very happy with it & glad I bought it.  Thanks for reading.

Ed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Yes it Jelly beans on a vertical scroll which is why I took off a star. But that is a non issue for me. The battery life is exceptional and it has power to spare. For 500 bucks the starting storage should have been 128gb, instead of 64gb. The 256gb model at a price point of 650 is a no go. 100 dollars more gets you an 11 inch M1 powered iPad Pro with 128gb of storage through Amazon….which is a no brainer as compared to the mini. The center stage camera feature for zoom conferences is nice as is the usb-c port. Why on earth the iPhone 13 doesn’t come with a usb-c port is beyond me. If you are looking for a small powerful tablet and do not need a lot of storage look no further than the entry level mini, just wait until  a good discount comes along.

  I give 2 star only because of the fast shipping. I know it's not pricey, but please still handle the package with care. I was so excited to open the new iPad until I saw this was already damaged while it was shipping to me. No air bag or bubble wrap to protect the product in the box. It won’t take you more than five minutes to do that. This is just so heartbroken to see how your reckless packaging ruins this piece of art.

  I would have chosen another color, but this was available.  The sports band feels like skin and is extremely comfortable.,I got the watch to track my health readings  during sleep.  My CPAP was under FDA recall not to use.  So I was monitoring my O2 level sleeping without CPAP.  O2 levels were dangerously low so I got another CPAP and they came up to normal levels.  The watch clearly showed this.,The watch has so many more features that I may sometime use.  I recommend the series 7 watch.

Yooo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  if you've never used apple watch before, please note that it's in general a one-day watch. If that's a dealbreaker, you should look somewhere else.,This watch is absolutely beautiful. The screen is bright and texts are crisp. It's blazingly fast compared to my apple watch 4. Thanks to the bigger screen we can view more information on the watch face. I thoroughly enjoy all the smart features apple brings to this watch and its ecosystem. Think of this apple watch as a mini iphone but can track a lot of fitness features and health info. If you are interested in heart rate, The Quantified Scientist youtube channel did a thorough study and showed that this watch's hr is very accurate.,I put the charger on my desk and when I work I leave it there for charging. It's charged super quick, like 15m or so and I never ran out of battery. For daily life of WFH, my watch's battery is always 90%. My usage is checking notification every now and then a roughly 1hr of workout (indoor so no gps).,if you have an apple watch 4, the only main diff I'd say here is the spo2 sensor. If that's not important to you, I think it's not worth the upgrade though because the apple watch 4 is still very very fast.

  This is my first Apple Watch, so far I’m loving the convenience of it. However….. after 4 hours last night and 3 hours on the phone this morning with Verizon technical support (3 different tiers of folks) - I still don’t have cellular functionality on the watch, which is the whole reason I purchased this one! Very frustrating and time consuming to say the least. Hopefully the bugs will get worked out quickly.
"
Rich P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is apparently the best smart watch for iPhone owners and it is a great watch.  While it is disappointing that Apple doesn't include a power adapter for most devices, just plan on spending the extra money to get yourself a USB-C adapter when you buy any new Apple products.  The overall app integration and health features make this a great watch and daily companion.  If you want your daily step count to appear on the watch face, you need to download a pedometer app and then add the steps to your watch face setup, but once you do that it's a great feature.  It will probably take several months to learn 50% of the watch features, but so far it looks great.

Adriana Norwood,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve always been a smart watch user, however, being that I recently converted to Apple after finding that I enjoy their products and software, I needed a new watch.,This product is beautiful. The screen is high resolution, it’s fast, and you can seamlessly transfer between phone and watch. The screen is small, but it displays a lot more information at once than I really expected it to, so using it isn’t a headache.,I love the utility. Everything you think a smart watch should do, this watch CAN do. From needing a calculator, to switching your songs, tracking your activity & workouts- basing the calories burned on your heart rate. I exercise a lot and appreciate the information smart watches can bring. You can text, call, read emails, make payments. Etc.,The only issue I have with the watch is an issue I have with apple products in general- if you’re like me and this is your first apple watch- you’re probably going to have to watch a tutorial or two in order to know how to turn it on, and to know what this watch can really do for you. Apple does offer “helpful tips” but those tips aren’t really comprehensive as to how to use your watch. I probably still don’t know all I can do with it, which is cool, but frustrating.
"
Beastsefus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really like the series 7, I had the 6 so not much difference in overall functionality however the screen is noticeably larger, more smoothed out and rounded. I was a bit disappointed in what they are calling green. While it is not black, it is not black like navy blue isn't black and yet is called blue. The green is there, but it is not even as green as the phones are. But I would buy again regardless as I do really enjoy the larger size.

In Search of Value,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's extremely irritating that Apple will send you a $400 watch with absolutely no way to charge it. It's so exhausting how they keep changing things like this to force you to buy new accessories. They didn't bother to include the required USB-C power adapter with the watch, something that almost no one actually has. So you need to shell out another $20 and hope your watch, with horrendous battery life, doesn't die before you can get one. Either give us a power cord you can plug into a standard USB driver or give us an adapter with a USB-C plug. This is really ridiculous.
"
Gary Lecureux,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is only day 2 of my apple smart watch. So far the capacity of the series 7 far out weighs the fitbit versa 2 accept it doesn't seem to collect as much sleep data as the fitbit did. I have insomnia and liked seeing when I got a good nights sleep but overall this watch has a lot more to offer. I am new to it so I will most likely come back to modify this review. As usual the setup was pretty intuitive. Remember if you are looking for data collected to look in the Apple Health App that comes with your iphone. I love tekky stuff so this watch will keep me busy for a while. I paid almost 3 times as much for the Apple watch as I did my versa 2 so I am expecting a lot more. I may adjust the star ratings as I become more aquanted with the watch. I was a little disappointed in the charging cable not including the power adaptor. It has a magnetic end that attaches to the watch, which is nice because if you use a screen protector you won't have to  remove it to charge the watch. The other end however is a type-C and I had  no power adaptors with a type-C. I was able to  charge it with my tablet and I also have a couple of portable power supplies that have type-C so I am good until my new power adaptor arrives. I was reading in a forum and another person complained about the same thing and someone pointed out that it is our responsibilty to find out what's in the box. That's true but for that price I still think you should get one with the watch. Apple claims it's to help the enviornment. Power adaptors sometimes get legs and walk away on there own so I think it best to provide one.

  Phone although in new condition, I have to question its longevity. The ""charger cord"" that was sent for one is NOT and APPLE charger. Its a Samsung charger.

This was $400+ wasted not to mention my time...........I honestly expected what I was paying for, yes.

JilSpan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the watch and am sure once I get cell service added it will do exactly what I need it to do.  I got this solely for the “Fall alert” function. I find it a  MUCH cheaper alternative than life alert and those kinds of services.,Many other features - as listed in detail on the watch description., BUT **IMPORTANT TO KNOW**,The “charger” included is the cord only! It has the round disk type on one end of the cord and USB-C end on the other.  It ONLY plugs into a USB-C charging cube.  The cube is NOT included.  You can buy one here for relatively cheap.  But I recommend you buy one when you order the watch if you don’t already have one.  I have an old Galaxy 9S phone that has a C port, so I can charge it on that for now. But that is a short term solution.  My other option was to wait 5 days for Amazon before I can use my watch.,Watch did come with 87% charge, but set up took battery down to 55%.  So you will need a charging cube when you get the watch.  Again- a cube with a C port… NOT a lightening or regular USB port.

  Overall Apple Watch S7 is a great product without doubt. But compared to S6, the improvements are really not big - only a slight bigger screen in my opinion (tangible change). The SoC etc. are the same. So if you have the S6 even S5, there is no need to upgrade from my perspective.

  Phone is awesome. However on day 2 I scratched the watch doing dishes. I thought the watch was indestructible. Come to find out it can crack and scratch. Please get tempered glass and case unless you purchase stainless steel and sapphire glass. This model is 729 gps cellular stainless steel. Make sure you get apple care through carrier think it’s cheaper. Note stainless steel van still scratch but it is quite durable. Other than that this is my 1st Apple Watch and the ease of use is phenomenal as well as the merging of my cell phone with the watch. Mom gave it as a gift and I absolutely love the fact that I can get a real time pulse ox+ hr+ and ekg! Fall detection is great cause I am a diabetic!!! This is the watch for those who want to be independent but have health issues that can  cause barriers to that goal! Safety wise it’s a keeper💪🏾

  Cons: So if you’re switching from a fitbit for your first Apple Watch like myself you’ll miss your Fitbit it doesn’t track your calories all day like your Fitbit because it doesn’t automatically detect your work out/calorie burn.  It doesn’t track your sleep details the same either I almost want to buy a Fitbit..that’s just weird though wearing 2watches…last bad thing is the battery you have to charge it every day oh…and mine wasn’t charging I had to go to Best Buy and get another charger cable I got the one with usb port then it started charging…screw that other one it doesn’t work.,Pros: it’s fun technology I like how my ring notifications come out on my watch and it shows the video. I like how I am washing my hands and it times it. It’s good to check your blood oxygen and heart rate,But that’s it pretty much I can still control my my music like on my fit bit I don’t really text people from my watch I guess that’s the other benefit but other than that nothing really amazing about it. I didn’t get cellular you don’t need it if you always have your phone near by. It connected to my  phone quick. I miss my Fitbit.though the only sad part

Johnny H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Looking thru all the reviews and most of the negative ones are about battery life not satisfactory. I have tested my Apple Watch series 7 with not having the “always on” display and found that if I turn that setting off I only burn 25-30% battery in a full work day 10 hrs. I don’t know about you but if I’m not looking at my watch, why would I need the display on? When you turn “always on” display feature off watch display comes on only when you look at it immediately and that’s perfect for me. Just go to display and brightness on your phone in the Apple Watch app and turn off “always on” . Think about if your phone had a setting where it was always on……it would be dead in no time and everyone would be complaining the battery doesn’t last.

RG,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple does a lot of stuff well.  Mac Books, iMac, iPad, and iPhone.  As a fitness tracker it is excellent and how it integrates so well with the iPhone, but as a watch is another matter altogether.  The short battery life, the rectangular watch face limiting details, and no seconds indication when in low-power-always-on-display mode are all big drawbacks.,The Apple Watch will get you at around 26 hours on a full charge. This is completely unacceptable if you are frequent traveler or someone who falls asleep with their watch on.  It is one more thing to charge in such a short time.  Your phone you put down after some time, but a watch is used more frequently.,Sometimes in 2022 or by 2024, Apple should introduce an Apple Watch which has greater than 36 hours in a round face.  Until then, save your money.

  I am an Apple guy. I converted from PC ~ 2008 and have loved every apple device until the IPhone X and the new Macbook with M1 chip. Where to start? First, as is a major complaint for everyone, the Macbook pro has all of two ports (yes yes, I know, this was listed in the specs. It doesn't make it ok). If I need to be plugged in, I have 1 port remaining. It is incredibly idiotic that I have to buy a dock to expand my ports. Oh and the ports are only Thunderbolt in Apple's continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage. I did not buy a Mac Air for a reason, yet the Macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an Air. The new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense. The track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless. I have no bluetooth connectivity. I get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music. I see zero performance improvements with the M1chip. In fact, doing a side-by-side video recording with Quicktime (all parameters equalized) I have a severe lag with M1 Mac, but not with the Intel driven machine. And the touch bar is about the worst idea ever. I constantly dim the back light, or go back on web pages because of it. Absolute trash. I bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns, because that's how terrible it is. I will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming Macbook Pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed.,So now begins the massive switching costs for foolishly demonstrating brand loyalty to a company who has none for its customers.

  Update 8/10/21,A few updates now have made the pinwheel subside quite a bit, hope that future updates will make it go away for good.,Previous:,I constantly get the pinwheel when switching between programs I.E. Explorer, Outlook, Teams, amazon music, notes, etc. These are not high power requirement applications. It is especially bad when docking and undocking from my workstation.  I have my previous MacBook Pro setup exactly like this model and it powers through without issues. The problem has gotten so bad that I have momentarily switched back to my previous one until Apple gets the software figured out with some updates. Disappointing!

  I can't even believe that I am writing this review, but this is unprecedented. After just one week of using it, I want to get rid of it. This laptop is slower than my 2015 MacBook Pro 15 inc. All this hype about the M1 chip, and when I open 20 tabs on google chrome, it's game over, the laptop starts lagging, the sound cuts, I can't even move the mouse and of course, my favorite spinning apple colored wheel is spinning forever trying to load. My CPU is at a 100% this is not what you would expect from the latest apple models, and this is out of the box laptop

  So i got this item which was not working and had the camera going crazy with green lines all around. I asked amazon  for getting a working laptop for my interview and they said we dont replace items that are electronics which is weird since my friend faced similar issue and he got a working laptop. And due to all this i had to re-schedule my interview and the company said we will be moving on with other candidates this time.,Thank you AMAZON

  Had Windows based computers since day one. Always something going on with them. I’ve had at least 10 windows computers and decided it was time to try an Apple. Well I got to say I love this computer. A little bit of a learning curve but not a stumbling block. Don’t let the 13” fool you. It’s an awesome screen size and so sharp. I would recommend this computer to anyone.

  I don't normally write reviews, but since I spent $1500 on this MacBook Pro M1 13"" from Amazon I have been very pleased. I have had it for less than a month and so far everything seems to be in perfect working order! I really love it to be honest., I was skeptical and a bit anxious about buying from Amazon instead of Apple directly, but I can say that there is no difference and it seems I got it $100 cheaper on Amazon and 2 day shipping. Just make sure it's sold and fulfilled by Amazon., All in all very pleased. For anyone on the fence about it you shouldn't be. Screen is bright, speakers are amazing, keyboard feels very nice, and battery is great!

   I was not disappointed as this was my first time buying a computer on Amazon, and here is why.,The ordering experience was much easier than my last visit to an Apple store to purchase a computer.  The computer arrived in two days, on time, a gift to our son who is heading to college.,This space grey laptop is the perfect size and weight when on campus. It includes an audio jack and two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports.,The package also includes a charger with a cord and a straightforward setup.,I like the fantastic Apple design of this laptop with the space grey casing.  I'm glad overall that this laptop will last up to 20 hours on a charge, has a great screen, and is more than the required memory and speed as requested by the University. Simply perfect and well worth it.  Therefore I rate this product five out of five stars.

  Coming from years and years of PC, I must say that this 13"" M1 Macbook Pro is an Internet beast. I also use it for Lightroom, Photoshop, Affinity suite, Capture One, FL Studio and I have zero complaints. I hadn't had a mac since the mid 90's and I was a huge fan then, but PC's just offer so much more for the money.,The ports are an issue and you will need to buy a dock like device because you'll need it to hookup older devices or more than two devices at some point.,GET THE 16GB model - While I have no issues with RAM so far, I believe the 16GB model should be the base model because the hibernation/sleep is going to kill the NAND hard drive eventually from writing to disk every time you close the lid.,There is an issue with the keyboard that I haven't been able to replicate, but the delete key will enter a state where it doesn't work, though the keyboard still functions. I have to close whatever window I'm typing in in order to get the delete key working again. It's not random, but I haven't figured out what two key combo is causing the problem or if it's just in twitter.,The screen is 100% accurate (close enough) out of the box - The reason I got the macbook pro is because of the issues I was having with my 15"" Dell XPS, which is a beast, color discrepancy when exporting. The colors were always over saturated and I had to guess what settings to use to counter the output. I did everything imaginable and always color calibrate with Spyder (for 10 years I've done this) but the accuracy was never the same on other screens, printing or web postings.,I never used the touch screen on the XPS. I hate smudged screens.,THE BATTERY LIFE is insane, as you've probably heard. 2 days, all day, no issues surfing the web at whatever levels are auto adjusted for on battery usage.,The touchpad - While really good, there are times when the two finger scrolling skips around, but overall, is a good experience.,I'm not a fan of the operating system at all, just like iOS, it's just too clunky and cluttered. Something odd coming from a company who builds incredible hardware with fantastic esthetic designs.

  For many people this will be a great and fast notebook. If you connect devices you need to know the ports are fast but can not supply very much power. If you have software on CD/DVD, be aware that your bus powered DVD drive probably will not work. Same if you attach external storage that needs more power than a newer SSD. To fix this you need a hub / dock that is externally powered and supplies power to any device plugged into the hub.

Brittany,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I FINALLY, after years of my artist friends and colleagues using apple product (laptops, MacBooks, desktops) I decided I’d get one as I needed a new laptop since my previous one was 10 years old. At first, I was just sad for having spent so much. I thought “this better convince me otherwise”. After having this for two months, I can say I hate it.,Don’t get me wrong, there’s some decent features that add convenience, but I struggle to complete work in a timely manner as I have to constantly save or redo lost work. The MacBook can’t consistently run (for example) Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and one Google page. I know you’re probably thinking “maybe her file size of the projects she’s working on are bogging down a successful running speed and responsiveness.” That is not the case.,The work I am creating at this moment in time is basic web design, typographic studies of minor levels of file work, and an occasional image that needs photoshopped.,All in all, this product is a bit expensive for my liking. It’s got many decent aspects, such as a finger ID to unlock easily and touchscreen bar along the top of the keyboard display. Cool. But not worth $1,300 (after tax) if it is going to prohibit my work in graphic design.

WheezingLamb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This new iPad Air, on the surface, isn't anything groundbreaking. It's a bit faster, a bit thinner, a bit lighter, and a bit shinier than all the tablets I've used before. But, taken altogether--and taken along with the second-gen Apple Pencil--it feels like an entirely new experience. I haven't been this struck by a new device in a while.,Over the years, I've owned three or four iPads, a few Android tablets, and a few convertible touchscreen laptops running various OSes. I've always been partial to Samsung because of the S Pen, and I've owned a couple of Galaxy Tabs and the Chromebook Pro: I love taking handwritten notes during meetings, and I like writing my first drafts by hand.,But this device, with the Pencil, is leaps and bounds better than any other tablet I've used. Writing and drawing on it feels completely intuitive and fluid. The responsiveness of the interface with the pencil is amazing--it reproduces my handwriting (chicken scratch that it is) perfectly. And more than that, the built-in handwriting recognition in the OS is frankly astounding. Either using the Scribble feature to handwrite form entries or using the Notes app's feature that lets you search your handwritten notes, everything works FAR better than I expected them to. Let me reiterate: my handwriting is atrocious. And yet, this iPad is able to decipher my hieroglyphics with a frequency that actually makes the feature really useful--I was expecting it to be little more than a gimmick, as in the past handwriting recognition apps have been completely useless for me. There've been a few times where I actually giggled out loud when the iPad recognized something I'd written that I could barely read myself.,Outside of how perfectly the iPad, iPadOS14, and Pencil have all integrated into my workflow, the design of the device itself is very nice, and the build quality is excellent. The tablet feels oddly light while still feeling very sturdy. And it's thin--even Apple's marketing images really don't do it justice. And obviously the new processor is nice, though I won't pretend to have done enough to even come close to pushing its limits. But the entire experience has been very smooth, even playing around with video editing and trying to find the most graphically-intensive games on the App Store I could. Haven't seen any lag or stuttering at all.,All that said, it's not perfect. I do wish Apple was finally putting OLEDs into more of their devices outside of the iPhone. The screen on this really is gorgeous, don't get me wrong. And the blacks aren't awful or anything. But given how great everything else is on this device, having a backlit screen--as advanced and pretty as it is--just feels weird. And I'm kind of ambivalent about the power button TouchID. Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled the Home button is gone, but I think I'd kinda prefer FaceID. The TouchID on this iPad works great, and it does work very quickly, but I'm spoiled by being used to just tapping the screen on my iPhone and having it unlock itself automatically.,Anyway, those minor gripes aside, this is a great little device, it fit itself into my workflow immediately. I think the highest praise I can give it is that it's amazing how quickly it effectively disappeared: within a couple days of using it, I stopped noticing it, because everything about writing and taking notes with the iPad and the Pencil felt second nature, it felt like it had always been there. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.

Florida,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Having had ipad , ipad air 2, I would have to say this is the best one yet.  Compared to my previous ones, this is blindingly fast, easy to transition and load all my apps from my ipad air 2. I took a bit of time to get used to no home button, but not an issue and the larger screen is a plus. Bottom line, I think this is the best model, unless you absolutelt need the additional features of the ipad pro.,ONLY issue I have is with the method of shipment from Amazon. I am a prime member and appreciated the fact that I ordered my two ipad air 4’s on the 23 rd of Oct and got them the 25th. Super! My only issue is them being delivered by USPS, dropped off on my front door, no signature or anything else for $1300 worth of product.  Luckily I am in a great neighborhood, but one would expect UPS or FEDEX with a signature.,Got them ok though and am very happy with my purchase. And am 99% satisfied with Amazon as well.

  I purchased this as a sort-of alternative to my laptop. Just something to surf the web and social media on and play the occasional game. The speakers on this thing are INCREDIBLE. So loud and full of depth, it’s great to stream music off of. Totally recommend this for the casual user, and with it’s new chipset, this thing can handle some serious multitasking for the not-so casual. If you’re on the fence about buying an iPad Pro, I recommend you consider this as an option instead, unless video editing is something you’re planning to do constantly. I have no quarrel with this product! It has served me well so far.

  I held off replacing my iPad Air 2 in hopes the Air 4 would be worth it. So far, the Air 4 has worked flawlessly. The migration was so easy and fast; just backup old iPad to iCloud then using the same Apple ID do a Restore from Backup to the new iPad. All my apps and their associated data was installed in Air 4. Incredible! The graphics are beautiful, the new CPU is very fast, I've been an iPhone 11 user for a while so the absence of the Home button wasn't a big deal, but I do find myself reaching to the where the Home button used to be. I had considered the low-end iPad Pro but Air 4 costs less and for my needs, gets the job done. You won't be disappointed. PS- I got free next day  shipping with Amazon, too.  That's a big plus.
"
BobotheBear,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I find Apple continues to disappoint with their newest product releases.  The theme seems to be ""change for the sake of change."" And in many cases the change supplants features that apple had so perfectly implemented the result is a decline in usability.  That said, I feel like a spoiled child.  Even reduced in so many ways this is still a very acceptable device.  Anyway, on to the pro's and con's:,Pros:,The device is light, has a gorgeous display and is instantaneously responsive.,WiFi is noticeably strong on this model.,The battery lasts slightly longer (about an hour) than my 2018 iPad Air 2.,And the (terribly paced) fingerprint reader works instantaneously.,<update> I've noticed that the audio is substantially improved over earlier versions.,Cons:,They moved the fingerprint reader to the top corner, presumably to increase the size of the display. Locating the reader on the corner impacts the software UI driving endless changes that have negative value, and add up to a sizeable reduction in quality of user experience (IMO). Apple needs to accept that they should create or buy in-screen fingerprint technology. A tragic design decision.,The camera is a huge bump on the back of the iPad.  You simply cannot set it on a hard flat surface. Testing already shows damage to my iPad because of this idiotic design.  If you buy one, buy a case before you unbox it.,<update> I forgot to mention it removes the lightening plug for USB-C.  Given no one uses this connector for anything but charging this is a perfect example of Apple's ""change for the sake of change."" A silly change with negative value to owners of multiple apple products.,The design reverted back to the iPhone 5. Blocky corners.  I don't really care about aesthetics. But I find it funny apple is regressing to older uglier design styles.,The new iPad Air is certainly different. It's still an iPad and arguably the best tablet in existence. Yep, an iPad is like pizza. Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  But if I could turn back time, I'd have purchased a regular iPad.  Because Apple had the iPad perfect. There wasn't a need for unfortunate changes, just for the sake of changes.,I'm going to try and return this Air and purchase a regular iPad.  It's cheaper and frankly a much better device.  Perhaps, in my opinion, the best tablet ever made.

  I was so nervous buying an iPad over Amazon. But I’m so happy I did! I got this iPad for $569 when the usual price is $600. The set up was easy , came with an adapter and charger. Came in the official apple packaging so it was very official. iPad was already fully charged! This is my first iPad purchase and couldn’t be happier! It took 3 business days to get to me despite the pandemic ! No troubles at all . Totally recommend:)

Wisewo1f,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  To start things off, this is in my opinion a really great tablet. I’m currently using the tablet to write this review with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse that I bought for it and all three together make a really great combination. The way I’m going to handle this review is by talking the screen, battery, processing power, connectivity. I might add on a few things in a later update.,Screen,Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 was kinda impressed but when I first turned on the tablet I immediately noticed weird frame rate issues that were very noticeable, I thought for a second that I might have received a broken tablet but I decided to update the tablet to see if it would go away and it did. Comparing it to my S4 It’s definitely an upgrade but it sure does strain my eyes way more than my old tablet but it looks better in my opinion. I really love going through social media watching YouTube videos and texting, I’m texting way more than I did in the past 5 years and the onscreen keyboard is so great to use. One thing I do want to complain about is that the blue light that this tablet outputs must be very high because the day I started using this tablet I found it way harder to fall asleep. Be sure to turn on Night Shift to get some good hours of Zzzz. Besides that the screen is great and in my experience it’s the perfect size for using it as a tablet, if you’re going to use it more for a laptop get the big IPad Pro.,Battery,This is going to be short. The battery is very great, it has a 7606mAh battery and it goes for days without a charge. I don’t play any games on it but I do use it as a laptop for college and it still does very great. The 60Hz screen must really help battery life because this tablet with very heavy usage can go for about 3 days until it dies. If you are worried about battery life don’t be because it’s great.,Processing power,To help you understand this has the same A14 Bionic as the iPhone 12, it’s crazy fast. This will handle any game, college work, photo editing anything you can think of. It does only have 4GB of ram but it doesn’t seem to slow it down in any way. With the amount of power this thing has it will still be fast 3 years from now. To make this short I’m more worried about the world ending than this tablet being slow in the next few years.,Connectivity,Connecting to my iPhone XS was super easy and both work together so seamlessly like I can’t even explain it. I haven’t had any issues connecting to my speakers, keyboard, WiFi router, texting (just so you know your iPhone has to be on to be texting from your tablet), everything works great. I used to have issues with my S4 connecting to my speakers and issues connecting to my WiFi router with my laptops and it makes me very happy to see that so far I haven’t had any issues with this tablet.,Overall?,This a buy for me. If you need a full laptop replacement to do crazy 4K video editing and got cash to throw around, get the Apple iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 4th generation) but if you want to get more bang for your buck and are mainly going to be using this as a tablet and doing basic college work mainly using Google Docs, heavy gaming or heavy media consumption then this tablet is more than enough. I got $50 off during Black Friday and I consider that a crazy good deal. I don’t regret buying this tablet. In my opinion this is far greater tablet/laptop than the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ especially if you have an iPhone because you will not be able to send text messages from any Samsung tablet if you currently use an iPhone. So far, I’m very happy with my purchase and I’m sure you will be too!!!

  The watch is great! I love it! The band it comes with sucks. Definitely buy a different type of band when you buy the watch. Mine kept coming apart and before I gave in and bought a new band, it fell off and the watch landed on concrete which cracked the screen. I did not get an extra warranty for a cracked screen and the price to fix it is as much as the watch

  We purchased this Apple Watch and it comes with a USB-C to lightning charging cable. However, it doesn't come with a USB-C to outlet adapter. If you don't have one, this will be an extra expense. Talked to Apple support and they say that to support the environment, they stopped including the outlet adapter after the iPhone 12. I'm all for supporting the environment, but this is obviously a cash grab. If I can't charge the device, it's no good to me. Don't buy if you don't have a USB-C to outlet adapter laying around.

tania,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Just got them, I checked the serial number in the apple website and they’re legitimate. It’s got warranty for a Year (Apple care it’s extra), pretty good sound (it could be better in my opinion, I like to feel the bass, but that’s my preference), I had to change the ear tips because the first 10min it hurt my ears (it has the medium ones on, so I changed it to the small ones and problem solved), noise cancellation and transparency mode works perfectly (spacial audio as well),I bought them mainly to workout (Weights + LesMills workouts), my main concern was if they were going to fall when I do BodyCombat, Attack, Balance, Sprint BUT do not worry, if you got the right ear tips it will not fall out.
"
PM,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality and noice cancellation were spectacular. You can drown out the sound of a noisy class in seconds.,The only issue I had was that they kept falling out of my ears. I could be walking and I feel it pushing out of my ear and bam dented by the concrete. I tried all the tips and they felt comfortable but at least one side always had to fall out.,Again awesome noice cancellation and sound quality and maybe it’s just my ears. I still would give it a chance.

  Kinda upset with Apple and Tim Cook lately and ""his infinite wisdom"" (or lack thereof) at the moment but these are pretty awesome, can't lie.  Bought these for my wife with specific tastes and never liked my regular airpods.  But she started stealing them so I bought these for a present and darn it, I want them too....  I was underwhelmed by airpods (which are a better Apple product) but these are solid and SUPER *SUPER* comfortable.  That's my biggest plus.  The other ones don't feel very good but these are pretty comfortable to wear.  Good luck!

  Not worth the money. They are good but not almost 200$ Good. Awful for working out. Should come with inner ear hooks or foam tips for better fit. The inner ear hooks on Amazon work great with these but you have to take them off when you put them in the case which is annoying and will probably wreck the hooks at some point. Sound quality and noise cancellation works good. Very simple controls . Wouldn’t recommend for the price tho.

Jack Reynolds,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So, like many I finally decided to take the plunge & purchase the Apple Airpods Pro at a lovely $198 + tax.  Well, I am sorry I did & HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you don't & stick to the Apple Airpods 2 version, instead.  The sound is well, without much base.  I mean R&B and Hip-Hop / Rap or House Music should have BASS.  Trust me, these Pro version DO NOT - it's more like high treble.  The biggest complaint is when it comes to changing songs.  On the Airpods 2 I used to be able to tap on the ear bud twice & change songs.  Now, on Airpods Pro I must squeeze (twice) to change a song - REALLY TIM COOK???  Anyways, because of the shortened stem on the Pro version, it's difficult to grab the stem & squeezing it twice DOES NOT WORK!!!  I've read the literature & you must be VERY PRECISE in order for this feature to work.  Anyways, I have inadvertently pulled out the earbuds many times trying this & when you are running or cycling it makes it difficult as you have to stop & go retrieve your fallen Airpods Pro.  Also, on the Airpoods 1 & 2 I used to have a thin silicone lanyard around my neck & on the stem to hold them in place just in case I sweat too much or accidently hit them & they fell out.  Well with the Pro version YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!!!.  Thanks for screwing a great feature set APPLE & Tim Cook.  Yet, again, the design engineers & Tim Cook have disappointed an end user.  So, while cycling today, 6 days after I got my first & LAST Pro set, one of the buds fell out while trying to SQUEEZE the stem to change songs as lifting your Apple Watch is not always conducive while cycling.  I had to try to squeeze multiple times.  In doing so, my right ear bud fell out & it went right into the street grate & now LOST forever - THANKS TIM COOK!!  I now have a useless Apple Airpods Pro set.  So much for stereo.  Anyways, do yourself ALL a favor - stay with the 2 - the sound is TRULY BETTER than the Airpods Pro.

  The first time I wore these, it felt like they were sucking my ears into the silence of noise cancellation.,External noises fade away letting me concentrate on what I'm doing.,Sound quality is better than average, battery life is good and they even pause the music when you take one of your earbuds out to talk to someone. Amazing.,You can answer calls by squeezing either of the earbuds and if you do a long hold it turns of noise cancellation.,One of the coolest parts is how when you open the lid on these headphones, an app pops up on your iPhone or iPad device showing you the current battery status of individual earbuds and the case.,The charging case supports wireless charging so you can place it on a Xi charger and have it charge itself.,It also has a Lightning charge port for wired charging. (Doesn’t come with wall adapter. Just plug into any USB port.),Overall, I'm very happy with these earbuds. To me they set a new standard in this technology.

  Good price. Setup is rather tedious but typical for most electronics. Once done I have really enjoued it. The only con I have is it takes a usb C power source to charge. I had my apple phone charger but that is a regular port charger. Truly I have about 20 universal power cubes, so this was inconvenienient to order the usb C and wait on delivery.

  Bought for my daughter who works in the water.  The water resistance of the Apple Watch is perfect for her job.  This keeps track of her activity in the pool and helps her keep track of time during lessons.  Love the bands are interchangeable.  Sleek and attractive design

Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch is great! I love it! The band it comes with sucks. Definitely buy a different type of band when you buy the watch. Mine kept coming apart and before I gave in and bought a new band, it fell off and the watch landed on concrete which cracked the screen. I did not get an extra warranty for a cracked screen and the price to fix it is as much as the watch

  I received this watch that didn't work.  After many hours on the phone with Apple the watch has to be sent to them because it has defective parts.  It never even could take a charge.  I have been a very frequent shopper on Amazon and am very disappointed.  I'd like to hear from Amazon with what the company would do about this.  If nothing, I will no longer shop Amazon.

  After my frustrations bought 2 previous watch for fraction of the price in past and one for my sister for her Christmas present ended up in disaster , I got fed up and decided to bought  me and my sister an Apple SE watch, and it was the best smooth decision I ever made. It is expensive for the price but it is well worth it.  I’m happy and product is amazing. Thanks

  We purchased this Apple Watch and it comes with a USB-C to lightning charging cable. However, it doesn't come with a USB-C to outlet adapter. If you don't have one, this will be an extra expense. Talked to Apple support and they say that to support the environment, they stopped including the outlet adapter after the iPhone 12. I'm all for supporting the environment, but this is obviously a cash grab. If I can't charge the device, it's no good to me. Don't buy if you don't have a USB-C to outlet adapter laying around.

  One of the best smart watches with an eco system that many participate in. Love competing with my friend and family with the fitness tracker which only makes us all healthier for it. Great for checking messages and notifications and quick replies. Absolutely love this Apple Watch. Who needs a 500 dollar Apple Watch when the SE is more then enough.

  Very sturdy and not too heavy. It was real easy to setup like every iPad I’ve had in the past, which saves a lot of time for busy people.,Pictures were sharp and screen was clear, the camera was focused and fast. It’s a great device to read books and watch videos on which is easier on the eyes than your phone.  It’s a good buy and I highly recommend!

  Movies are so dark they are almost unwatchable.  I have spent days trying to brighten the screen with very little luck.  Researched and found almost everyone complaining about this.  There is no solution for this I can find.  Everything else is fine.  Everything else you have to turn down the brightness.  Would have never bought it if i knew in advance.

  Barely three months old and it stopped working.  It would not charge or turn on.  I took it to apple store and they replaced it but the same problem again in less than a week.  Now apple store claims the new problem may be related to the charger and they won't cover a replacement and pushed me to talk to amazon.  I wish I had bought it from Costco so I could return this junk tablet.

  Excellent resolution, a pleasure to read or watch videos…. New virtual keyboard is different and to me…  troublesome compared to my previous IPad Pro 9.5 and 1st Gen.  I personally don’t care for the different character placement, however people that use a Microsoft keyboard daily will probably like it better. I don’t, and even after daily use for two months, I still am not used to it…. causing more mistakes and misspells.. Additionally, slow shift key  and caps lock key comes on very easily… causes me to have to redo same keystrokes often.  Hope that Apple can tweak this keyboard with software updates and make it better/easier to use. Product expensive, about $300 overpriced in my opinion.

  I spend many of my days reading ebooks on my Kindle app.  When I accidentally dropped my trusty, 4 yr old iPad and shattered the face, it hurried me into a decision I had been considering anyway.  The new 2021 IPad.  Great choice!  I’ve only had it for less than two hours, yet setup is complete. All automated by the connection between my old iPad, my iPhone and my new 2021 iPad Pro.  Blessings on you, Apple.  Way to go!!!!!

  Wanted to leave my personal experience w/ bloom, since reviews here made me hesitant to purchase.,I use my iPad at a lowish brightness (below 50% of the highest setting), I only use dark mode, and I use the iPad primarily for digital art w/ Procreate.,In a dimly-lit room, I've never seen any bloom. When using my device in a pitch black room, I do start to notice minimal bloom, but it's so minimal that it honestly doesn't matter. Also, 90% of the time I'm using the device in a well-lit room, so it's a non-issue for me.,I love this purchase for digital art (the screen size is amazing, but I'm thinking the 11inch would also have worked just fine). My device does get hot when working in Procreate on projects with many layers (100+), but it takes a good number of layers for that to become a problem. On smaller projects, I don't experience heat issues unless I've been working for a couple hours.

  Its an Apple product, do I need to say more? The picture on this is amazing.  I was worried about the size,(is this going to be big and bulky) but once you watch something on it you realize it was worth it. It could be a bit heavy for some but I don't have an issue.  Keep in mind a case is also going to add weight depending on which one you choose.  I'm very happy with this iPad.

  Digital, IBM, since the beginning of all this tech.,Like any electronic device the product/brand one starts with becomes the staple. This is a perfect size for the task of EFB and other aviation related items for the pointy end of the aircraft. First impression is that it will work just fine for that task. It's over priced, invasive (yes one can configure privacy) the icons are not intuitive to an IBM'r. Seems all the apps have a price attached, and plenty of ads for more Apple products and services. There are a couple free trail offers included, 90 days Apple music and Apple TV, keep your credit card handy. Plenty of slanted news pop ups, pick your direction.,As far as the device, the screen resolution is excellent, the fingerprint reader (no more face scan I'm told),works perfectly, and two fingerprints can be used, well engineered item. Camera features and quality are Nikon like, very very nice. Sound output is reasonable. The mail program is clunky, the split screen widget is a pain as it slides one way and is tiny button operated the other way. With a VPN active, some of the Safari browser inquiries won't load or are rejected.,There has not been any screen flicker issue, as of yet, I'd heard this was a problem? maybe resolved now??,After two weeks the learning curve is finally straightening.,kc,12/15 update  the touch screen will NOT work with gloves on....sad.

  So I kinda hate it but not enough that I would give it 1 star.  I wish it were a little narrower.  Not a lot, just a little.  And this has been said on other sites.  WHY ISN'T IT A PHONE?,The one I have is 5G and I can emulate it being a phone with Google Fi but there's no reason for this.  It should be a phone.  That's just hard headed and trying to get people to buy a phone and a tablet both in their ecosystem.,That's another reason I'm not fond of it.  It's an Apple and I'm in the Android ecosystem.  I find it hard to do much of anything on it.  Seems like every time I try to do something it's fighting me.,So if you are in the Apple world and don't care that it's not a phone (don't buy the 5G one) then you'll probably like it.

  Well it’s apple.. so make you bleed to pay for it. Of course it works. The iPad mini i don’t think I would buy it again. It is not formatted correctly for the screen and sometimes can strain your eyes. Stick with the larger ones with everything optimized for the screen the mini just doesn’t feel finished to me like my pro does. It needs work. The only thing I impressed with is the battery life it was about same as promised versus the Apple Watch 7 I have that drains in 3/4 of a day

  This is my first apple device, cause I'm a confident android user. I bought this little gem mainly for reading purpose because of it's display size and high PPI. Most of my reading materials are in PDF format, and even in lowest zoom the pages and text are dead sharp. No pixelation effect.,If you do not concentrate on finding so-called jellyeffect on page scrolling, you wont notice that it is even exist, I assure you. Got it with apple pencil, and couldn't be happier.,Have been waiting for new iPad mini to buy, and here it is. Thanks.

Mike Roberts,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love the size, features, display is gorgeous. I chose the 256 GB version, wi-fi only. (I use my iPhone’s wi-fi hotspot feature when necessary.) I use my iPad mini 6  around the house for a myriad of things, including tasks where I previously had to fire up the PC (laptop). I can stream sports and other programs anywhere, including where space is limited. FaceTime is terrific with the Centerstage feature. I asked for the Apple Pencil Gen 2 for Christmas so looking forward to using that to take notes at meetings, church, etc. Recommend mating this iPad mini 6 with the very affordable ProCase sold on Amazon. I’ve written a 5-star review of the ProCase. Don’t recommend the Apple Smart Folio … very little protection and WAY overpriced at $59!

  I really like this iPad mini, it charges fast, battery life last a good long time.  I love the fact to set this iPad up I only needed to set it next to my old iPad and everything transferred, I was pretty amazed. The color is great, it downloads quickly and its pretty lightweight. Its easier to carry in  my purse, than my old pad. I am not real tech savvy and I only use a few programs, mostly for Bible Study and playing games.  I don't like that there is no where to plug in my headphones. I guess get I could get earbuds but I am a lil old fashion. All-N-All I like my new toy!

  Liked: Portable Size, Sharp Screen, Apple Pencil writing, sharp screen, fast Touch ID, 2 screen multi tasking. Great Travel Companion to give your phone a battery break!,Advantages: The pencil w this iPad is good superb w handwriting, Illustration, and drawing.,Best Uses: iPad mini is best for teens/college students so they can organize their notes or have entertainment.,Disliked: Slow 5G T-Mobile, not a device for productivity, grabbed my iPhone 12 mini more, some apps looked distorted in size like McDonalds App & banking.,Got M1 Mac Mini for $569 new w Xmas sale. $589 refurbished.  Better value. Logo graphic design and editing docs is faster on a Mac.

  The watch 7 packaging consists of two standalone boxes for your selected watch and band, wrapped together. The watch performs great, and the extra screen space makes a difference. The keyboard functionality actually works even for my relatively big fingers. The bigger watch works perfectly with bands that marked for the 44mm ( even seem like a better fit to the wristcam camera bands). I believe the apps needs updating as most of them have some funky behavior with the new keyboard and voice functionality. Will probably change to 5 stars soon when that happens - but basically do not assume full screen or keyboard for older watch apps without an update.

  Lots more info and options than the under $100 fitness watches. Really enjoying Fitness+ workout options. Doubt I will ever go back to a lesser model. Battery life isn’t what i had hoped/expected. Requires a daily charge. Fortunately, it’s a rapid recharge. As far as accuracy, often doesn’t recognize that I am standing and have been for several hours simply because my arms aren’t moving enough while working at my standing desk. It does provide notice, though, so i can flap my arms and achieve my rings. Good motivation overall. It’s a lot of money compared to other fitness watches, but it’s worth it!

  we were excited about the medical monitoring.  we are an apple family with an iphone, 2 ipads, and a imac, none of which are compatible with the apple watch!  no mention of strict requirements on the amazon website. our only option was to buy a new iphone or return the apple watch and investigate alternative medical monitoring options.  shame on apple's merchandising philosophy!

megan hoosier,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been using the watch for almost a week. The charge only lasts around 18 hours. It does charge in about 45 minutes but definitely doesn’t stay charged as long as the Fitbit.  The ekg works great, and I feel the 02 sensor is pretty accurate.  Make sure to order the C charging plug if you don’t already have one or you won’t have anything to plug the charging cord to and your watch will die while you’re waiting.

  Why the heck wouldn’t you include the usb c charger with this watch?  Just plain ridiculous!  Especially for the cost of the item!!!,The band stinks. I have lost the watch due to poor design of band.  The part that lightly snaps into hole does not hold well at all.  Come on Apple people, think long term.,Now, I have to say I didn’t know until I read info on this watch but it comes from China. Apple…the us citizen s could use these jobs. Don’t you think?  Therefore, this will be my very last Apple product purchase.

  I resisted buying a Apple Watch...I don't know why since I have been using iPhones, iPads, MacBook Pros for years.  Possibly because I don't usually wear a watch much anymore.  But that has changed with the Series 7 Watch.  Seamless integration with my iPhone and the features are awesome!!  I was not sure about the band, but I'm beginning to like it more everyday I wear the watch.  The altimeter is accurate, and the heart monitor appears to be spot on as well!  Another awesome Apple product!

  I have upgraded from Apple Watch series1,I have waited for along till apple’s new watch features gets better and better.Apple Watch is the best version of it now and I recommend 41mm cause it feels like a watch in your hand for both men and women.also a cellular cause you have to pay extra for cellular but the regular one connects to WiFi and it’s fast so it’s connection with iPhone is very good and gets updated fast with notifications texts and etc.

  I am 73 years old. The week after I purchased this watch I fell. This watch immediately alerted to ask if I needed emergency help. The emergency button was on screen available for me to press if I was injured or could not get up. It requested confirmation that I did not need help. I wish I had it earlier this year when I had broken my foot from a fall, rather than hobbling to a phone I could have just pressed the emergency button. Thank you, Apple Watch.

  None too pleased about a couple things: Made in China, and didn’t come with a USB-C charging block. I happen to be temporarily staying near my parents’ home in the middle of nowhere where I can’t just drive down the road to pick one up, which means I have to drive 30 miles and it’s continually snowing here with bad roads or order one and wait. When you’re from Atlanta and have everything at your fingertips, this sort of frustration should not be encountered, particularly when dealing with Apple. We Apple buyers have grown accustomed to the finer details and Apple cheaping out leaving us inconvenienced like this is extremely the wrong move by Apple. For me, it’s not about the cost to go buy a $10 USB-C block, it’s the inconvenience and hassle it poses me that I have to drive 30 miles one way in the stupid snow to do it. Geeze. Now my pretty new watch sits here dead.

  Clearly this was a trick of some sort because what I was sent was not an Apple Watch rather than Apple piece of an Apple band.

For the price I paid this is not right.

Just like power rangers. What more do you need lol.,The box that it comes in is worth it too. Love the box presentation. Love it.,One big FLAW… doesn’t seem to want to work with Amazon music. Guess apple company doesn’t quite like its competitors. But it will connect to pandora lol.

  I felt like my Fitbit had been old enough to start being less accurate. And given that I have fallen into all of the Apple products, it seemed like the Apple Watch was a no brainer. It has been nothing but frustrating. I can’t figure out how to turn specific things on or off, and it even vibrates at four in the morning to tell me if it needs to be recharged, or if there’s any other insignificant thing going on. I turned off notifications and can’t figure it out. Also, I really appreciate it looking at Fitbit and looking at my steps. Not having to click 1 million things to see my heartbeat or my steps for the day. I can’t figure it out how to answer the phone, it’s not working with half of my stuff, it acts like it sends an email and it doesn’t.  I am completely bummed about spending money on some thing that was supposed to be helpful. I should’ve stuck with the Fitbit.
"
Brandon Golueke,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The item works fine. Lots of great features for sure. However there were a couple of issues that make this product over priced. The first disappointment was that it only comes with half a charger! Luckily my wife already had a charger. The next was that this thing really only has a days worth of battery life. I have to take it off so often and forget to put it back on. I bought this thing to monitor health, which it does very well, however i have to take it off to charge every single night which means heart health isn’t tracked at night. For 500 plus dollars, this product should come with a charger (come on!) and it should have a better battery. Going to return it if I can.

  Initially, I never wanted a Smart Watch. Then, my husband got one & I thought his was pretty cool. SO I started looking at one similar to what he had (a Fossil), but was unable to find something I liked, or could even tolerate. Since I have (and love) my iPhone, I decided to look into the Apple watched, and found this one on Amazon. Although the price was rather off-putting, my husband & I decided that, with all of the health benefits the watch has, I should go ahead & order it. Well, since getting the watch. I've worn it all day, every day, and I simply think the watch is AMAZING! I can check my heart rate throughout the day (something I need to do), and keep an eye on my blood sugar levels (since I am a Type One Diabetic, and have the DexCom App on my iPhone, it also shows on my watch--how cool!). The watch encourages me to stand up a couple of times an hour, which is great, since I work from home & sit at a computer for eight hours/day. I love that I can make/receive phone calls from the watch, too. In the week that I've had my watch, I've found that I use my watch more than I use my iPhone. And to think that I was so.very.opposed to getting a Smart Watch... Now, I don't know how I ever got by without it.

  It's a Macbook Pro bro. What's there not to like. It's been 9yrs since my 2012 Macbook Pro purchase and I still use it. I just have to keep it plugged in because I can't find a good battery replacement for it. This M1 is much thinner. 😯 I would say half as thin as the 12 retina model.,Battery life seems good but it was good on my last one. I can use it all day. Button press trackpad even the touchbar is good. I do not understand the complaints about the touchbar. I find it kinda cool and ok. Maybe my opinion will change after some use.,The speed is what everyone raves about. I don't see it. It may be slightly faster but it's hard to tell just how much faster. When I open or load it doesn't seem super fast as everyone claims. I'm sure it's faster but it's not like its drastically noticeable.,I had one issue initially. I set up my fingerprint ID and all was fine until one day it didn't work and it asked me for my password. I could not remember my password and it took a whole day to figure out how to reset it. So far it's only happened once and I hope it doesn't happen again because using the fingerprint scanner I forgot my password already.😄,The audio is good. Definitely not tinny or hollow its that good quality audio you expect. Good full sound. Volume is ok too could maybe be a little louder.,I do not like that it has no ports. Just 2 usb C slots. 😐 You will have to buy an adapter. At least they kept the headphone jack. I also do not like clicking to drag n drop. I don't see any settings that I can change for this. I like being able to tap and 2 finger drag.,I was expecting this to be really fast because that's what they were bragging about but for the money I maybe should have got the air with more GB. But the camera and sound is better on this one. The screen doesn't look as HD as the retina model seems a little flat but it's good. Overall you know the quality of Apple. I will most likely always have a Macbook Pro. 😉👍

Fnorgby,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  There are too many baffling oddball problems -- like it won't do portrait mode on a displayLink monitor.  It has problems with docking stations that ought to work just fine -- despite me turning off sleep and screen locking, when in clamshell closed mode, sometimes it won't wake up and has to be hard power-cycled or zapped to get it to boot back up.  These issues are virtually nonexistent on Intel silicon of the same era/OS revision level.  The problems with external monitors feel like they're reintroducing problems most vendors (INCLUDING APPLE) fixed over a decade ago.,I'm completely soured on M1, and have no interest in M1X.  I may trade this in for a Mini.  It's all but useless as portable computer because docking/undocking causes such nightmarish problems.,M2 maybe, once it's been out for a year or two.  Yes, I know that this is the risk of being an early-adopter.  I'm still going to call out its flaws even though I know I am the author of my own suffering here.,Also, again not an apple problem but a me problem:  I hate the touch bar and leave it completely disabled.  I'm clumsy and have big fingers.

  I am a long-time windows user. I've had so many different windows laptops, each with their own faults. I've always despised MacBooks because of what you hear from every person who's built a pc before: ""Apple makes crappy products!!! No good to use!!!!"". Ever since I got my iPad Pro a few years back, Apple has slowly dragged me back into the ecosystem by how good their products have become. With the release of the M1 macs, I was pretty interested in how well these will perform, and eventually caved and bought this MacBook Pro.,I was wrong. I've been wrong. This MacBook Pro has very good performance and has kicked ass through everything I throw at it. I like the Big Sur operating system, everything has been made super easy, and also connects to all of my other Apple devices. Being able to to text people from my MacBook is awesome. My only complaint is honestly, like everyone else, the Touch Bar. I wish I had the regular function keys like on the air. I got this one because of better battery life, and man. This laptop lasts me a WEEK. What???? My ol reliable acer laptop only lasted me 8 hours, and I thought that was good.,Sorry windows fanboys. Sorry pc master race. For laptops (I will never replace my home windows desktop), the MacBook is one of the best devices you can buy. It's great.

Patrick Walsh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I left my brand new M1 Macbook pro in my car for an hour and now the screen looks like a Picasso painting.  Both Amazon and Apple refuse to pay for repairs because apparently this is considered an accident rather than a manufacturer's defect, even though I bought it only two months ago.  So I'm out $700 to repair a two month old computer.  I would heavily advise against buying one of these, because if this is considered normal rather than a manufacturer's defect, then 80 degree heat is enough to damage the screen.  This means that they're essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer.

  this is a M1 model - It is fast, it is light, it is powerful, it wakes up in seconds..... it saves me time like crazy, no longer the annoying ball.... - it replaces my old and faithful MacBook Pro late 2013 (yes! 2013) - everything works from the beginning..... in my older Mac (which I still keep just in case) I could still run everything I needed, but it was definitely much slower - the new one is great - take the op to say KUDOS to Apple! until 10 days ago I was still using a 7 years old computer, running Big Sur and every single app I needed and the only change, has been one of speed (great change by the way) - all is compatible, I just put in a CalDigit dock and do not need to buy anything else new..... - well done!

  I am extremely disappointed with this machine. I bought this specifically because it had a GPU, which I thought would be beneficial for programming with data. However, the new Apple Chip is completely unworkable. None of the modern software packages for data science are compatible with the chip, rendering the machine worthless and void for its intended purpose. I will never purchase another Apple machine.

  I was so nervous because I've never purchased a computer through Amazon. It arrived in great conditions! Battery was around 90% when turned on, great performance, great battery life as described, vibrant colors in the screen, very satisfied with this purchase!

  My laptop lasted less than 4 months before it died. I talked to an Amazon rep who was responsive and put me in touch with an Apple rep, who was curt. He suggested bringing it to a local shop licensed by Apple to diagnose and repair, but he said they didn't have an appointment for almost a week. At the shop, they were much more responsive but warned that a small crack in the bottom of the screen that happened when I close it one day likely caused the problem, would not be covered by the warranty and would cost $700 to fix. (Fingers crossed it is something else, but he said he was 95 percent sure this would be the case.) Two issues with my 2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage): 1) Debris can fall into the seam between the keyboard and screen unseen and 2) I kept having to adjust the brightness; even though I set the screen to be bright, it kept returning to dim. My other complaint is that the Apple rep was curt. The tech at the shop said he sees a lot of screen issues and highly recommended by the warranty-plus plan, which costs over $200, for two years, I think, and then $100/year.

  Battery life and new keyboard if nice but this mac freezes a lot. When you open more than 10 tabs, when open finder, when connecting to external monitor this m1 freezes I need to constantly force quit the applications. This Macbook ""pro"" only ""supports"" one external monitor. Not a reliable laptop.

Ian,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I switched to the iPhone 13 Pro Max from the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and after my first 10 days of use, I can say the switch has been fine.,Display Quality: Prior to purchasing my Galaxy S20, I had used iPhones for about 6 years. I switched, primarily, because of the 120Hz refresh rate screen, which Apple took a little too long to implement. Many people say they can't notice a difference, but for me it is absolutely night and day. 120Hz makes 60Hz nearly unusable. In this regard, while it did take Apple a while to implement it in their phones, the implementation has been great and the 120Hz on the iPhone Pro models is well worth it.,Display Features: The notch. Goodness let's please get rid of the notch already. It's 2021. The iPhone STILL has the notch up top, and no matter how many times people say ""it disappears when you use the phone"", no it does not. The notch is annoying, plain and simple. And while it is a little more narrow, it is now just a bit taller. The iPhone also still does not have under-display touch ID, which is another frustrating feature that has been on Android phones for some time and really needs to make its way to the iPhone. The facial recognition does seem great, which is a good feature to have.,Camera: I have really been impressed with the camera so far. I'm not a big enough camera snob to really tell you that one phone is objectively better than the other, unless we are comparing phones 3 or 4 gens apart, but I can say that I am very pleased with the camera on the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Edge detection on portrait mode CAN be a little tricky at times with closely competing colors, but overall I still feel it's very good.,iOS 15: At the time of my purchase, iOS 15 was already available and I immediately switched over. Having already been on the Samsung train when iOS 14 was in use, I cannot give much of a review on them compared. Overall, I preferred my OS setup on my Samsung phone. It is much cleaner and easier to navigate, especially when using 3rd party launchers. I could just swipe up from the bottom and Android would list all of my available apps in alphabetical order with some favorites I picked on the home screen. As many as I wanted. iOS is a little clunkier, with all apps existing on the home screen and the overflow screens. Sure, you can order them however you'd like, but if you have a ton of apps, it's always nicer with an automatically sorted list. Setting notifications is also clunky and it can be a chore to toggle those you need to see and those you don't. A lot of one-by-one. As someone who doesn't want a ton of push notifications, going in and having to turn all those I want off instead of just those I want on is troublesome.,Performance & Battery: Overall, the performance on the iPhone seems equal to or greater than my Samsung. I believe the iPhone 13 Pro Max is powered by 6GB of RAM, compared to my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, which had 16GB of RAM, the performance of the two is very similar. Something to be said for app optimization. Where I have had issues in the past with Apple iPhones is when they approach the 2-year mark, the battery health starts to really deteriorate. I did not have this issue with my Samsung. However, the battery life on the Pro Max is insanely long and if it stays relatively healthy throughout the time I have it, I will definitely be more than pleased.,Support: One thing that really sets Apple apart is support. They are pushing iOS 15 to the iPhone 6S, which came out in 2015. Android just simply doesn't do that. Support disappears after 2-3 years, at least in my experience. This is a huge bummer when you consider the cost of flagship devices to the consumer, and Android REALLY falls behind in this regard. If you consider a possible 6 year support cycle for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, you're looking at a phone you could possible have until 2027. That's definitely something to keep in mind.,Overall: Functionally, I think the iPhone is still a little clunky and dated, but it's an OS that works and people know. The ecosystem is tough to beat, and with so many people have iPhones, sending videos and pictures through text without them being unbelievably downsampled is a huge plus. Apple is still behind in some of the features you can get on Android devices, but they always say they may not necessarily be first, but they always implement the features well, and I can't argue with that here. It's a solid flagship device that has potential to last you half a decade or more. You won't be disappointed.

Robert,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I traded in my 11 pro max 64 GB Midnight Green to get the Apple 13 Pro Max 256 GB Sierra Blue, carrier locked by a major carrier.,The iPhone looks a bit fresh, slick and feels very sturdy. I like the color alright but I always use Apple leather cases on my iPhones and those colors released do not quite go with the Sierra Blue phone. I ended up getting purple and it is not quite a match. Apple should have released the Blue Jay color in leather as well. For me the Pro Max phones are hard to handle without a case and there are no better ones than Apple leather cases. The new phone slips out of your hands easier than the 11 pro max, which was much easier to hold with the case than this.,The audio quality improvements (increased clarity and fidelity) are great on the 13 pro max and you can see that in the speaker mode as well. That alone can justify the upgrade for me but for some minor setbacks, more on that later. While at home I use Wi-Fi calling and it is super clear, better than the previous phone. The 120 hz refresh rate that auto adjusts based on the need for it is a welcome addition. Scrolling looks great and so does video playback. Although I do not play video games on iPhones, it can be a game changer for those who do. The other major improvement is the speed of processing with the improved processor, you can see the iOS completing tasks faster.,I liked my old Apple 11 Pro Max, but needed a phone with 256 GB as 64 GB on the 11 pro was too small and the carrier ran out of other sizes at the time I got it. The storage capacity offerings that Apple released the new one with can be very important for some consumers and I am really happy with the 256 GB. I have a big Spotify library, a photo library of my family and extended family as well. Whatsapp takes quite a bit too and I already filled almost half the storage.,Battery improvements over the 11 pro max are small and really should not play a part in your decision to upgrade, if you are upgrading from a 12 pro max it is a significant difference. The 13 Pro Max has a good camera package and that alone can be worth upgrading for folks who need it, but for me the quality of the pictures and videos with the old phone were just fine for casual use for most occasions. I have good Nikon equipment for serious pictures and a good camcorder. Apple’s ios15 privacy protections can be used on the older phones too, but on this device the new processor and 5G can make a difference in speed with VPN and private relay feature for iCloud.,Negatives:,I use a lot of apps: financial, grocery, shopping, sports, news, Spotify, podcasts and travel. Most of the apps show really small font in large areas of the screen. There are no settings I know of to fix that, this happened with the new phone and iOS 15. I did not have this issue with the older phone and previous iOS. The settings do not change the font size in the apps entirely, meaning it leaves certain important portions of the screen unchanged (you can increase the text size in iOS settings and add the text size feature in the control center and try what works best for you). For example, on the Amazon app, while writing this review, the font couldn’t be increased no matter how big I go, it just increases in some areas, same case with my other shopping apps. This is likely not Apple’s fault but the Apps are to blame. However, that small font shouldn’t have been allowed by Apple.,While away from home and not connected to Wi-Fi I have had choppy phone calls for which the carrier recommends turning off Wi-Fi calling as 5G or even 4G should provide good quality. This setting change is a hassle as I like using it while at home. I will need to observe this more.,The 13 pro max is also harder to handle even with the leather case comparatively and you can easily feel it is quite a bit heavier. It is impossible to handle it in your hands without a case as it is very slippery and heavy. You almost always have to use two hands, as the 6.7 inch phone with a rather large bezel is too big for most. If you are not already using a holder in your car for your mobile phone, you have to now. I would rather have the old size because of the weight issue, but all the improvements need that extra space and mass. Also this one slipped out of my pocket while sitting in the car seat a few times already while the old one rarely did. Another issue I noticed several times is that safari freezes up on me on the new one, likely iOS 15 bugs. The bugs are likely temporary unless there are hardware problems that cannot be corrected with software updates. The smaller notch is slightly better but still a negative as it looks weird along with a big bezel, which is pretty un-Apple-like.,Summary:,All in all the upgrade is worth it for me but really the new one is not quite necessary if you are a light user and have iPhone 11 or 12 for most use cases, nevertheless it is worth considering it as you may discover an important feature you would rather have. Please try it at a store before buying it, you may be impressed with the improvements. The smaller 13 pro and 13 versions of the device are pretty good too. If you are happy with the 6.1 inch size, the 13 pro may be perfect as weight and handling won’t bother you. I have also seen the 13 and it is very light to hold, but it does not have the same camera package, but it can be a perfect choice depending on your preferences, it won’t slip out of your hands nor pockets.,Recommended accessories you can get on Amazon:,Spigen glass screen protector, Apple leather case, Apple 20 watt fast charger USB C type, cradle type car holder mounted on air vents (I use Mongoora brand).,I took the Apple survey but it does not let you leave comments, so I came here to post this review.

  It has been a tremendous help in tracking my fitness progress. All the features are easy to use and I like that it's compatible with my phone and other apps. My favorite feature is the water lock because I can keep it on my wrist when I do laps in the pool and it's tracking my laps. The one thing I did not know when I purchased this product is that it does not come with a plug. Luckily I was able to pick one up at Target for about $20.

  Most Notable changes from iPhone 12 to iPhone 13:,-Thicker/Heavier: 174g, previously 164g,-A15 Chip:  previously A14 Chip,-Battery:  3240 mAh, previously 2815 mAh,-Brightness:  800 nits, previously 625 nits,-Storage:  128/256/512GB, previously 64/128/256GB,-Cameras:  New/bigger sensors allow for more light capture/detail, New Photographic Styles and Cinematic Video effects.,The camera notch at the top is also noticeably smaller on the iPhone 13.,Opinions so far:,This iPhone 13 seems very similar to the iPhone 12.  After using it for a few days, I can't say that there is anything dramatically different about this version compared to the iPhone 12.  It feels slightly heavier, the screen is a bit brighter, the cameras seem to do a slightly better job in low light situations (sometimes), and it can shoot Cinematic Video, although I've had mixed results with that feature.  The new chip should be faster, and the bigger battery should last slightly longer; but I haven't really noticed much of a difference in either of those categories with my daily use so far.,I can't really see a compelling reason to upgrade from the iPhone 12 at the moment.  If you are looking for a more noticeable upgrade, you might want to check out the Pro versions, as the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have 120 Hz refresh rate screens that really stand out to me; and combined with the better cameras and extra GPU in the Pros, those might be worth the extra cost to you.

  Not a verified buyer as i purchased the model 13 from the my phone carrier.  i only purchased as i was being forced to upgrade my model 6 which had served me faithfully for 7 years.  at least i did get a $200 rebate off the regular price.,Pro's,- decent storage options,- battery life is noticeable better (though my battery was on its last legs),Con's:,- if you're not used to it, the notch is as bad as it appears despite being smaller. so much for aesthetics, crapple,- color selection is abysmal - they look gross, fake and cheap compared to the high end color selection.  i went with midnight (black).  it really looks like a faded navy blue,- face id is joke, touch id was better,- no home button, the swipe function to exit apps is garbage,- no headphone jack (had for 9 plus years),- you get a usb to c connector, which means you have A. buy the new 20W block to fit your cable ($20 or more) , B. reuse your old 5W block w/ USB to lighting cable if you have it or C. buy the USB to C and the 5W block  (to bilk your wallet of more $)  France isn't allowing this to happen,-no headphone which means one has to: A buy bluetooth enabled ones, B buy a cheap dongle attachment. or C buy a set with a lightning connector (to bilk your wallet of more $),- have to disable and remove a lot of Windows style bloatware and disable locations service and lame azzed Siri and other non-useful standard functions.,all in all, newer is not better, I sure do miss my model 6!

  Purchased from Verizon  As this phone gets into the Cusstomer hands such as mine only then are the  issues discovered with the phone … being a new rollout.  On the iPhone front selfie camera there is an issue with black screen.  I have a 2”” band of black across the screen. Also the phone does not wake up when you lift it.  There are more issues that will become well known as the rollouts continue with iPhone 13 and pro max.  We are returning the phone. I purchased it for the camera.  I’d wait this roll out OUT  Poor value for the hefty price tag.  If you miss the return window which for me is 30 days you are out of luck.  Apple in to much of a rush ? I don’t know.  I have the iphone6 plus and 12max not one issue. Disappointed doesn’t cover it.  The hype is all about the camera and there is a hardware issue on some phones? Profit over quality.  What else is new

  If you have an iPhone it makes sense to get the Pro Air Pods because they are superior.  I have Sony WMX003 whateve over ear (three sets), 2 sets regular AirPods 1st Gen, 3M worktunes pro, 2 sets Jabra 75t, Beats Flex, Bose wired, DeWalt overear.  I've used all of them a lot.  I used these with my skidsteer yesterday without a problem noise-wise.  They cancelled the steady noise well enough the machine didn't bother me.,These are by far the best of anything I've used so far because the size and also the feature set.  The auto-connect is great.  I don't know how to check the battery level like on other ones but I might have missed it.  What boggles my mind and blows my mind is the spatial feature.  I started looking around after starting to listen to an audio book with that feature on.  It's like the narrator is behind and all around.  Spooky.  I just replied to a text message without touching anything.  Weird.  It's like the future is now.  This is a quantum leap over other products.

Jose A. Nascimento,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound quality is good although for me, once you get over $50 for earbuds I don’t notice any huge improvement in sound quality for the extra money. Noise cancellation is good, not great.  They are a little difficult to get out of the container but no big deal.,My biggest issue is that they don’t stay in that well.  Better than some others because they are streamlined and don’t have a big mass hanging out of the ear but I can’t imagine running in these.  I am constantly pushing them back in. To make matters worse, there are controls on the earbuds that I can’t seem to disable, so every time I adjust them I inadvertently pause or skip a track.  I’ve tried each of the three sizes of the rubber pads but it doesn’t seem to make a difference.  I’m guessing this depends on the shape of your ear, since I’ve seen people running with them on.

"Jerry C. Welsh, Jr.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got them on sale during cyber Monday. They do not come with a plug, which is a bit infuriating considering the price. They do fit in my ears compared with the often lamented universal Apple headphones. The good news, they pair easily with your modern devices -- just open the box to enter pairing mode. If you have an updated OS on your Mac/Phone/IPAD, it is a breeze. I was even able to pair them with my 10 year old IMAC whose operating system is not able to be updated anymore. I listen to music most of the day and I am accustomed to some rather large antique speakers which have a big sound (esp. bass), so these were slightly disappointing at first. You must make sure that you have a good fit with your ear for the optimum experience. The noise canceling is very good as is the transparent mode which allows the world to rush back in. I often stream TV content on my old iMac, so they will come in handy for that and when I travel. Will I use them every day -- probably not, but I think I am probably the exception here. I do not spend large amounts of time on the phone. Will these replace large speakers of a top notch sound system -- no, and I find I miss the ambient sound -- but the sound is very good. I do like to game a bit on the iPad, but the iPad pro has such good sound to begin with, I didn't find that they enhanced my game experience that much but my experience is hardly conclusive. The auto-recognition (when you have them in your ears) did not work for me several times -- I may have put them in backwards because they felt better that way, but the feature where Siri can announce your calls, etc. is nice. You can turn it off if you want a more immersive experience. I doubt I will use the haptic feature much - to be honest these things are pretty small and I would rather just change the settings on my device.

Taha Shafquat,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are great pairs of earbuds if you get a good pair and you buy it from somewhere other than Amazon. I order two of these while they were on sale during Black Friday, and BOTH of the AirPods had defects. One had a faulty case which would not pair with the phone or any apple device. The other had a bad in-ear sensor (which is required if you ever want to turn on noise cancellation). I called Amazon to ask for a replacement and received the run around and was being transferred between agents like a ping pong each one asking me the same information again and again, fed up with this I asked to talk to a manager and was transferred to another agent posing as a manager, and I only found out after I was transferred again to yet another agent who said that they cannot offer me a replacement and only a refund. What will I do with a refund now that all the Black Friday deals on AirPods are over. Either One buy the AirPods at full price $90 more than I initially bought them for or wait until next year. I have had great experiences with Amazon in the past but this incident has forced me to cancel my membership and never use Amazon again. Next year I am going to Walmart, Best Buy or Costco for my shopping, anything but Amazon.

  i was looking around to buy airpods from the actual apple store about a week ago right before Black Friday. I saw these while shopping on Amazon and was curious about the price..! They were on sale I believe 159$ HECK YESS. I’m so glad I bought em at this price not knowing they’re actual apple Airpods pro!!. The shipping was good three days only and they came packaged real good! Now let’s talk about the product itself, i was nervous reading the reviews saying it came damaged or used etc.. i did a comparison between my brother’s Airpods pro from apple store 249$ Vs these mysterious (apple Airpods pro 159$) they both looked exactly the same i was surprised apple assembled them in Vietnam but after all both of our Airpods pro are 100% no difference. I wanna mention battery life and sound cancellation, holy cow i love them so much and they last exactly how they’re described on Amazon! 4h plus on full charged, and the case can charges up to 24h. SIDE NOTE:: THESE AIRPODS PRO DO NOT COME WITH CHARGING ADAPTER (CUBE,POWER ADAPTER) only comes with C USB cable and two extra sizes of ear plugs. Don’t forget to buy your power adapter like i did, it came in the same box as the Airpods pro.

  Cut to the chase -,**Fantastic sound quality on phone calls. The noise reduction works very well and phone calls do not sound too compressed. I don't listen to music on my phone so I can't give an opinion of how they sound in that regard.,***They fit comfortably in my ears and stay put when walking around, bending over, and doing household chores.,***Charger not included. There's a USB C cable, but that doesn't help me at all so I had to buy an adaptor. Annoying. For the price that you pay for these things Apple should include a wall charger which likely costs them 5 cents.,***The airpods are very difficult to remove from the case. Being so round and so smooth there is nowhere to grab them to pull them out easily. To make things more difficult, they are held inside the case with magnets so you can't get them out by turning the case upside down. Not having the case magnetized would have made it better.,***There is no way to adjust the volume on the air pods. While on a phone call I don't want to say ""hey Siri, turn down the volume"" - you know? The volume has to be adjusted on your phone. Other bluetooth earpieces have a volume button on the earbud - I don't know why these don't.,Great sound quality, not user-friendly. 3 stars.

  These airpod pros are the most comfortable earphones I’ve ever used. I barely feel them in my ears - they just feel light and airy. The music sounds so clear and crisp and warm. I had been using Sony wireless WI-1000X prior to switching to these AirPods. I love Sony for the deep bass but those particular headphones really didn’t work well for conversation and also when it’s hot out, the battery part you wear around your neck just gets clammy and uncomfortable, so I was ready for less physically intrusive headphones. Initially I was wary of the AirPod design (how the heck do they stay in your ears?!) but now that I’m wearing them for the first time I’m sold on this design. Also they paired so quickly and easily with my iPhone straight out of the box. I’ve been using noise cancelling headphones for over 20 years and personally I wouldn’t bother with any headphones that didn’t have that feature. It really makes a huge difference in clarity and what you can actually hear in loud environments. Even something as simple as a dentist visit - when they’re drilling or cleaning - you can actually hear your music or podcast. And if you’re on public transport or a train or plane you can actually hear whatever you’re listening to well without having to crank up volume. Spatial audio is really nice too when it’s available. Very psyched about my new AirPods Pro.

  Love these AirPods Pro. Came packaged well, fast shipping. The features are amazing. I’d not purchased AirPods in the past because they were too big and hurt my ears (I must have little ear holes). These come with three sizes to put on the devices for comfort. The sound is awesome, noise cancellation is great for when you just want to hear what you are listening to or the person with whom you are having a conversation,  and the transparency allows you to hear other things, but still hear your music. It doesn’t come with a charging block, but it does come with a cable. I use this with a wireless charging pad and it works great!

  I've been in 1 (or 2nd??) gen airpods with no problems except that I.....lost them.  After reading about the Airpod 3's, I decided to wait and go with the Airpod Pros.  First try, the noise cancellation made me smile--almost *zero* noise!  Big change.  Love it.  As for fit, I the added rubber tips are a game changer for me.  In fact, I bought several 3rd party ""rubbery"" covers to fit over my old pods to make them better stay in my ears--which became a real pain once they got oily.  If i'm splitting hairs, the case is larger and because the pods are a totally different shape, they are very ""slippery"" trying to remove them from the case.  I'll prob get used to but worth mentioning if that's a hassle for you.  They were/are on sale as well.  Oh, I bought the 2-yr ""protection plan""--which I rarely do on anything--after reading the benefits.  Try'em out--free returns!

  It has been a tremendous help in tracking my fitness progress. All the features are easy to use and I like that it's compatible with my phone and other apps. My favorite feature is the water lock because I can keep it on my wrist when I do laps in the pool and it's tracking my laps. The one thing I did not know when I purchased this product is that it does not come with a plug. Luckily I was able to pick one up at Target for about $20.

  I don't care what anyone on YouTube says, these Air Pods 3rd generation have audio and comfort levels that are vastly superior to the Air Pods Pro. I now have BOTH the Pro and the 3rd gen (and many, many others that were reviewed as the ""best"")  and will take the 3's every time over all of them. I have heard all the glory about noise cancellation and frankly its a marketing ploy. These 3rd gen are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever worn. Between music and phone calls they are in my head 4 hours and more at a time. I even forget that they are there until Siri announces a call or text through them. The sound is also amazing with rich full bass that is balanced and enjoyable across many genres. If you just want a great comfortable sound and not worried about drowning out airplane noise or train clatter, then these are the one you want.

CUSTOMER AAA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are great headphones and good quality. Not sure why people gave horrible reviews of a new product without even giving it a try? Or even purchases it? I own the first gen, and think this one is great with awesome quality. Provide honest reviews, this is not a place to complain other generations.

  All my opinions:,Needed a new update for my 2nd generation AirPods. So I bought these and let me tell you it’s a learning curve.,Pros:,Sound quality is top notch,Spatial Audio is amazing!,Battery life is great.,Stem Size is perfect,Cute compact case,Indicating Light is on the outside now,Cons:,-Takes getting used to the size and feel of them.,-These sit deeper into your ear, not as deep as pros but they need to be wedged into the ears.,-if you wiggle your ears or smile widely it moves your ear canal and these suckers will fall out.,-Also Apple changed the charging cord to type C, so old cubes will not work. 🤨,So far these are working great besides the learning curve every new thing requires! Will update after a month of use!
"
Shibs,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  In my experience, the spatial audio is a gimmick, not sure who would want to continue listening it that mode after 2 minutes... Good to just to experience the feature, but that's it.,Fit : poor fit compared to the original airpods + it starts paining after a while - this is the main reason I decided to return.,Sound quality: at par with the original airpods.,I don't use this for calls, so the wind cancellation is a feature I'll never use.,Also with deals, price similar to that of airpods pro, wonder why would someone go for this!
"
David Martinez,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The listing says they’re new but we noticed when we unwrapped them they had 0 battery which was peculiar for a new apple product. When we turned them on and synced with Bluetooth we saw the AirPods were named “John’s AirPod’s #2” so they definitely have been used.,Otherwise they seem to be working, but I could have bought used AirPods literally anywhere. Super disappointed honestly and I hope these weren’t stolen or something. John if you’re missing your AirPods just let us know. We have them lol
"
praths,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Significant upgrade from my 1st gen. At the beginning I thought the spatial audio is more of a gimmick. But listened few songs and it completely changed my opinion. Head tracked feature is really good. You can definitely know the difference when it is off and when it is on.,If you are upgrading from 1st or 2nd gen, you will feel the difference when you try to fit them in ears. I also did not like it at the beginning, but they are actually more comfortable compared to their predecessors and do not fall off from my small ears even during workouts.,If you don't like in-ear headphones, this is the one to buy. I would definitely recommend this.
"
J. Bean,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first experience with Apples Airpods. I was sceptical as to them being something that I would like because people do complain about them falling out of their ears & I have always have had trouble keeping ear buds to stay in my ears. I primarily use the Bose around the ear headphones & I love them. I also have the Helm true wireless earbuds that have a built-in wing that nestles in the ear cavity so that they don't fall out. These ( Helm), have the best bass response, but are a little bulky. They do have a volume control that Apple does not.,  When I first got the Airpod 3's in I was blown away by how good they reproduced the music. The spacial audio is an amazing experience in itself. Battery life is good, but not even close to the Helm or Bose around the ear phones. A friend who owns the Airpod Pro's tried mine & he confessed that the 3's sounded way better than his. Pro's. I still can't seem to feel comfortable wearing the Airbuds when I'm moving around as they tend to come loose from my ear. No problem when sitting or lying down in bed, but as soon as I start to move, they slip. I've ordered a set of wings that attach to the buds, so we'll see how that works out. The downside of them is that they don't fit in the case & have to be removed to put the buds in the case.,  With that all said, I really like these Airpodd 3's. I don't have an iPhone, but do have an iPad. The pairing is instantaneous. I really miss having a volume control on my buds, that's where the Helm's are much better.,  I was fortunate to get them at a nice sale price on Amazon, so that won me over in making the purchase.,  I highly recommend these Airpod's.
"
Ruth,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought the Airpods 3 because I was very curious about spatial audio. They basically play some layers of the song out of one ear and others out of the other ear such that it sounds like the song is playing all around you. But that's the only stand-out feature I like.,These do not go inside the ear canal at all. They hang outside the ear canal and you're basically walking around hoping that they don't fall out. It's very uncomfortable. I find that it helps to wear them upside down (with the tail end up and the left one goes in the right ear and vice versa). Another problem I have is that when you're walking outside with your phone in your pocket, the connection drops.,I was going to return my AirPods but I couldn't bring myself to do it because the audio quality is still amazing and my other headphones just don't compare.
"
ItsJustMe,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had every generation of AirPods so far. These are my least favorite.,I loved the first/second generation because they fit nicely. I don’t love the rubber tips of the pros, but wanted the sound quality of them. I hoped that this generation would be a happy medium, but I’m disappointed. They do not stay in my ears. Admittedly, I have small ears and wear the smallest size tips of the AirPod pro, but these just do not stay in.,I really wanted to love these, and the sound quality is good. I can’t speak to the battery life, as I don’t think I’ll be able to keep them in long enough. Sadly, I’ll be sending these back and ordering another pair of gen twos.,I think these would work great for people with bigger ears though.
"
KP,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  New to the Apple watch and am very satisfied with switching over from Fitbit. Love the screen response, always on feature, and the size/weight. The water proof feature, heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 monitoring are great features as well. I was also concerned about the battery life but am surprised not only how long it has been lasting, but also how quickly it charges. My only complaints (coming from a former Fitbit user) are that the work out tracking detection is about 20-30 seconds delayed, the sleep tracking is not as detailed as Fitbit (if that matters to you), and the App could offer a few more customization options. Overall, very satisfied and would definitely purchase again.

texascutie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My 14yr old got his first iPhone for Christmas. I wanted to get him an older Apple Watch (I had the series 4 & was just going to get him that) but they are still so expensive! Spent two days looking online and couldn’t justify it. Came across this one on Amazon and noticed the green one was 338 bucks; sixty bucks cheaper than all the other ones. So I snatched it up for myself and gave my son my series 4 with this green band on it. So far I’m not really noticing much of a difference, and I can’t seem to get the same watch face complication that I had before; that bums me out. The battery life seems to be a slight improvement from my series 4, but there’s still no way to wear it all day and track your sleep too. I charge it overnight. I’m still not sure it was with the upgrade at this point, but I love all the functionality of it. I get Ring doorbell notifications pushed to my watch, Life360, and I love being able to answer calls without pulling out my phone. I’ll be an Apple Watch wearer for life (this my third one).

Angiep1987,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the Apple Watch series 6 and hated how short the battery would work. This one’s battery lasts way longer, a lot quicker to charge, item was as described, amazing resolution, I love everything about this watch honestly. Super simple to install and start using, I believe it took me 30 mins tops! I love how it is way more accurate on my sleep, heart rate, and all my movements and stats. My issue with series 6 is it wasn’t accurate as well, and wouldn’t track my sleep no matter how much troubleshooting I did. This one I have my sleep tracked on here, and way better application overall. I highly recommend this watch for people wanting something to have that does so much more than other watches and has a iPhone so they are connected all day long. I’m so happy to get this for Christmas and will never look back! ☺️💜

"
D. Zimmer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve owned an Apple Watch since the 2. I had the 4 and loved it. The 7 is equally as great and is faster, bigger, with always on and blood oxygen detection. The stainless steel feels more substantial and looks better but the aluminum is great too. I haven’t owned a titanium or ceramic version. All my bands work with this bigger size.
"
Joe Pohlot,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Watch is fine overall, does all as expected. The band, however broke the second time I took it off (see picture). Highly recommend buying at least 1-2 more bands when you purchase the watch to avoid the down time. The cheaper bands appear to be higher quality than the one it comes with.
"
Mpg,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this primarily to call for help in case I fall. I have not tried this feature.,UPDATE: I accidentally call 911 while putting on a stainless steel band. The response was immediate, was able to talk on the watch, I explained what happened, operator ask my telephone provider I assume to to verify I was lucid. PERFECT.,At first blush this seems to be a nice device full of nice features.,The documentation is non existent, you will spend hours researching. There is no connectivity to an iPad only an iPhone. While it does come with a magnetic charging cable, there is no charging brick and the cable end does not plug into a lightning port which means you will have to buy a charger specifically for this device.,Once you figure out the different nuances you will probably like the watch.

max,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you are like me and you have not tried to get an iPad since the original iPad release because you believe they have no utility, I recommend you take a second look at the mini. It fixes the problem of the iPad being so bulky and large that you think “why didn’t I just bring my computer” you can literally fit this thing in your back pocket in some mens pants. Perfect as just the ultimate notepad with the pencil. Hook up a wireless PS4 controller with Bluetooth and play old school GTA games, or download hundreds of gigabytes of movies and TV shows for a long car ride. The utility is there, and it is the ideal size. 2 Pop sockets for the back, one in each corner will help you A LOT and they help you not hold it upside down which makes attaching the pencil and using the buttons easier. 256 Gb version Wi-Fi only is connecting to my phones hotspot and will take calls when the phone is nearby and I have iCloud to automatically keep all the info on the iPad and phone the same so it’s literally my other easier to use phone. Will definitely enjoy taking it hiking for the first time, perfect compromise between a bulky computer and a small screen phone
"
Jessica Harper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve wanted an iPad for a while but not anything too big. I also didn’t want something as small as my phone so this is the perfect in between. I can put this on my desk and listen to podcasts or watch things on it while I’m doing other things and it doesn’t take up a lot of space at all. The battery lasts all day. It’s a little expensive but apple in general is expensive. It’s definitely worth it though if you are looking for something that’s a size between a big iPad and an iPhone.
"
Justen Minetti,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this thing!  This is my first iPad mini, my previous iPads were the Air 2 and the 2017 iPad Pro 12.9.  This thing is perfect.  It is so portable and so powerful at the same time.  Jelly scroll is a real thing, and it is somewhat noticeable, however it is on ALL iPads, it just so happens that this one’s orientation is in the vertical position while all others are in the horizontal position.  It’s only noticeable if you’re thinking about it and looking for it.
"
Sunny,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a beautiful update of the IPad mini.  It is my third IPad mini and I am so disappointed in the jelly roll screen.  As much as I want it, I will not accept this flaw or Apple’s explanation of it.  Whether they can’t or won’t fix it I am not sure.  I sent mine back.  Shame on Apple, not so much for the jelly roll screen, but for not admitting the problem and trying to pass it off as normal behavior of the screen
"
george88011,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m sure this mini is a step up but trying to move the data contents from my old to this new proved to be an impossible task for me. Some of the new ways of scrolling was more than I could get used to. I sent the devise back to the seller. Hope you have more patience and smarts than I have.

Jade,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Has to be charged twice a day. Good point is new USB is unbelievably fast.  I updated from the iPad Mini 5 mainly for Apple Pencil  2. . I lost or broke Apple Pencil 1 more than once, which of course is completely on me but the Apple Pencil 2 is so much safer charging and connected to the side of the 6. The 6 is slightly lighter which is great too. Overall the iPad mini is great and I would definitely choose this one if it were my first one.

  Packing (box inside a box zero padding),Arrived same day!,Jelly scrolling (Real and dizzying keep one foot on floor),Blacks (Not deep enough more like a dark fade  wash),5G (Waiting on Visible to get their poo together meanwhile a hotspot will do),Full  spacious desktop work station (With special well worth it attachment for full mirroring everything!) add the apple trackpad /mouse /keyboard .. it all works to take a break from screen touching..,Placing a metal plate on back snaps it to a magnetic car mount great for waiting at a super charging station watching a movie…,It’s light and small, and I don’t mind the strange frame borders and am saying just the screen quality/ behavior is it’s top shortcoming. Everything else is as good as iPhone 13.  Its like three 13’s  side by side wide.  With a pro screen it would be perfect.,Will keep it till apple raises the price another $100 for a pro version?  I can’t see getting a larger ipad though They are too large. Would rather magnify mirror scale it up if needed on a large monitor

  Got this to jot down notes and it's my primary e-reader for the books and research articles I read every week. Getting all-day battery life and it is much zippier than the previous generations of the iPad Mini. Makes a nice tablet for using at the gym to watch videos or read while I go on the treadmill or StairMaster. This is a great tablet for kids as well. I got another one for my little brother who is in grade school. He uses this to doodle and draws on ProCreate. Overall, for under half a grand, this is worth it if you are looking to get into the Apple community and want a tablet with a USB-C port!

  This is about my 7th smart ""watch"". I've have a couple of Fitbits, a Jawbone, a Zenwatch 3 (prettiest of the bunch), a Samsung Galaxy, and an Amazfit Bip (good watch for the money). I've basically got a smart watch museum. I got the Apple Watch because, honestly, I'm getting older and I wanted the fall detection and health features. I've had it for a couple of weeks and here's what I think, from bad to good.,1. Battery life sucks. It'll get through one day, but that's it. The Bip would last for 3 weeks on a charge.,2. The screen isn't great in direct sun. It's better than some others, but doesn't hold a candle to the Bip, which was somehow reflective in bright light, sort of like a Kindle.,3. The sleep tracking is ok, about what you'd expect from a movement detecter, but the app for it isn't very good. Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now.,4. It has some very nice watch faces, with custom complications. Best of the bunch.,5. Very comfortable to wear. The big stem doesn't get in the way at all.,6. The health features work great. It accurately tracks you pulse, and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand. I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.,7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.,It has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun. Lots of other things. The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it's unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were.

Shelby,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It took me a while to decide to upgrade my apple watch. Hard to justify a smart watch over $300, in my opinion, however, my Series 3 was so slow, took forever to install an update, no space for apps/data storage, etc...,I got a Fitbit Charge 5 as a temporary place holder, tried to convince myself I liked it more than an Apple Watch, ultimately I came back to Apple.  I opted for the 41mm Series 7 because I didn't need an extra 4mm for another $100.,It moves so seamlessly, fast to charge (lightyears ahead of the series 3), lots of new watch face templates to choose from, beautiful edge to edge display. Of course you can choose to have ""Always on Display"" but that will quickly deplete your battery life.,Ultimately, just get the upgrade that is within your budget and you won't regret it!
"
Kathleen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered this on 11/26 and received it at 6am on the 27th (gotta love rush overnight shipping being a prime member).,This was an upgrade for me coming from the Apple Watch 3 and then going to Whoop for a year and a half. Ultimately decided back on Apple for the smart watch features.,Few things to note:,1. The screen is a lot bigger if you’re used to a  41 or 42mm. Personally love the bigger screen but I also have a bigger wrist so it fits very well.,2. The watch does NOT come with the “butt” part of the charger you plug into the wall. If you have a newer charger for your apple devices (Ie when I got my iPad earlier this year I had gotten a full charger that I can swap the wires out with this) you’re all set. If not, go buy a charger when you’re purchasing this,3. The watch, for me at least, was closer to 90% charged so wouldn’t have been a huge deal if I had to Amazon prime or run to the store for a charger,4. Features are advances compared to the 3 but still have a lot of similarities.,5. Box comes with two band sizes. Small and then medium/large,6. The packaging is very well done. I was impressed when I opened it up,Overall I’m happy with this purchase (I knew I would be) as I spent probably 2 months comparing the new Apple Watch to the Garmin to find what would be best for me and my specific needs.

  Not the color I ordered. There is no charging block with watch. The end is different. It does not take regular charging block. Still have not found right block with a end to charge watch. So I can’t set it up to even see if I like.
"
Demhouser,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First, I just want to say that it DOES NOT come with a charger block for the USB type C, so if you don’t already have one, buy it along side it as I had to take a trip to two different Walmarts and a target to find one.,Next, I highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend you measure your wrist and go by the recommended wrist size that apple suggest for each watch. I’m fairly okay in terms of body weight sitting at 210 lbs and dropping with a height of 6’1.  My wrist size was measured to be 210mm so it was recommended that I go for the 45mm version but instead I decided to look at reviews on YouTube and I saw that majority of them recommended the 41mm version as the 45mm was “too bulky and was like wearing a TV screen on their wrist” so because of that I went for the 41mm. When I placed it on my wrist with the band, it felt like I was wearing the smallest watch ever, it felt as if I was trying to put on a watch made for children. Then I went to my friend’s who had a 45mm Apple Watch and tried his on and it fit perfectly, lesson learnt, listen to the manufacturer instead of random people in a video.

Anonymous Reviewer Dude,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this for $1099, which it's $1299 if you buy it from Apple, which makes no sense!  It was either this or the Macbook Air for $899 (which is $999 at Apple).  I got this because I've had many Macbook Airs and wanted something different.  If I had to do it again, and wanted to save money I would have gotten the Air.  The difference is this has a fan, a touch bar, a better gpu, and a brighter screen for $200 more.  I was worried because some people don't like the touch bar but I think it's great!  And besides, you can even set the touch bar up so it's just like the old function keys you're used to, but as touch keys.,There really is no competition for a Macbook.  I've tried them all, the Dells, the Surfacebooks, etc, and they're never as good as an Apple Macbook.

  I was excited to get the new macbook pro M1 as reviews described it as a very fast powerhouse computer. My first impression was strong. I started to play with all the features my old MacBook Pro is missing. I was excited about extending the screen to my iPad pro will be able to paint in photoshop (with Sidecar). This feature is completely underwhelming and unpractical to use (mostly due to how interface of this feature is set up). The next feature I was excited to try was installing iPad/iPhone app to MacBook Pro... Well, this works here and there, applications are crashing... again very underwhelming. Three weeks later my new MacBook Pro started having issues when plugging into the power source through thunderbolt. After I unplug it from power, the second time when plugin it wouldn't charge. I had to unplug the thunderbolt cable both from the power adapter and from a computer and plug it back to the charger first then to the computer in order for mac to charge again. I ran self-diagnostic on startup and it would freeze. Luckily I was still in the Amazon window to return this now broken computer. I don't understand how Apple machines became so unreliable. Now I'm hesitant to order another Apple computer as this is the very first new computer I ever purchased turns out to be a lemon.

Brian S in DC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've been an Apple user for over 35 years, and I was pretty excited to make the M1 migration now that many apps have been updated for Apple Silicon. I expected to be blown away, and while this is an excellent Apple laptop, and the battery life does live up to the hype, I overall I found it disappointing compared to the reviews. Three things:,1. Sure, it may fly if you're doing really CPU heavy things, but for things like ""heavy"" productivity, I found it no better than my Intel 16"". In fact....,2. This could be related to all the stories I read saying, ""8GB on Apple Silicon is like 16GB on Intel.""  Yeah, don't believe those. Again, this may be true for tasks that are well suited for ARM, but heavy productivity work is no better. I keep a decent but not insane amount of Safari tabs open at any time, and that plus having much of anything else open kept the memory pressure graph constantly in the yellow, if not red. And that may or may not be related to the biggest problem which is....,3. I had significant problems using my LG 5K display which has worked like a champ with my 16"". Sometimes it would take up to 4 minutes before things ""settled down"" and I was actually able to use the computer again. That was a dealbreaker.,Would 2 and 3 have been better with more memory, or are these M1 growing pains, or something else? I don't know. I'll probably give the 16"" a try with 16GB whenever it comes out. For now, this 13"" was just too underpowered for my fairly average professional needs.,I realize that reviews below 5 stars on this are rare, which I find puzzling for the reasons above. Hope this is helpful to anyone who might be wondering about the downsides.

  I love my MacBook Pro! I had the 13 inch macbook air 2017 and I hated that thing, used it for college and i wanted to get rid of it so bad so i gave it away. I always wanted the macbook pro because i thought they were just built better and i the interface of how its designed looked way better. Finally was able to buy one and so far so good. I really hope and pray this one doesn't start going slow like how my macbook air did after a year or 2. Bought one for my friend as well and she loves hers. I mainly use it for work, school/zoom calls and a little bit of streaming. Not a gamer so battery life is something i never have to worry about. Battery life was amazing for the first 2 weeks but  I can tell now the battery has been dying slightly faster but i believe it's from how much i've been on it lately but if i put it down for a few days (most likely 2) battery life hangs in there.

  Hyper portability, ridiculously speed and responsiveness, and a VERY robust battery are some of the highlights of this little Mac. It's up and running from sleep as fast as a smartphone wakes, the trackpad + gestures make me forget I don't actually have a touchscreen here, and the M1 manages battery draw like nothing I've ever seen in a laptop.,The Touch Bar is controversial, but I love it. It's a great premium feature, but not necessarily a great ""pro"" feature. Replacing the F# line of keys with a touch screen that changes function based on what app you're using is actually pretty great and it ties in well with the idea of gestures via the trackpad as a method of interacting with the computer.,If you've never tried a Mac before, I highly recommend starting here.

  This is my first Apple Computer and I am blown away! I will never be going back to Windows computers again. It’s a Thousand little things and quite a few big things that make Apple computers just better. I wasn’t a true believer but now I am. I love this MacBook Pro! I have it hooked up to a 30 inch Apple display and it is wicked cool. And I have the Apple Magic Mouse 2 and Apple keyboard.

   On the right hand side you can see a black line of dead pixels that quickly became much worse. And although it was on every window you can really see it on the graph where the image burned into the 3 week old screen that I barely used and bought specifically because it was considered the best option for trading view the program in the video. You can see. Facebook logo burnt in on the right but the whole screen was ghosting everything bad.  It’s just hard to see most of it. I have no idea what caused this. As it’s not a 20 year old crt display with an nes left on for years. It’s a brand new Liquid Retina I’m sure I’m not the only one to experience this but do keep in mind I was lucky and able to return because this happened one day before my 30 day window closed. My experience with apple has always been with second market items aside from my phone they are not very helpful unless you pay  a very high service fee. I’m sure I could have had this repaired for free but at the price and the fact that it was my very first Mac I sent it back and have no intention on owning another one. Best thing I could suggest is if you must own a Mack buy apple care they will replace  it twice brand new. U may need that done. The build quality outside of the electronics is unmatched. Absolute perfection in every seam. I wish it would have worked I bolutely loved this machine until the day it broke down. Now I won’t ever feel comfortable owning a new one again. I did purchase the m1 iPad instead and love it. Well my 2tb model. The 128 is not enough storage 2tb I’m sure will be plenty. I think apple is a great product as long u never have any issues. If you do be ready to spend like you did the day you made your purchase.

  I have an aging MacBook Pro (15"") which I use a great deal. At some point I know it will cease to function well, so I made the leap to the smaller 2020 MacBook Pro (13"") with the M1 chip. It runs fast, stays cool, and after a month or so of pretty constant usage, has been doing beautifully. Some of the newer features like the touch screen pad have taken me some time to get used to, but I'm learning to appreciate them. A word of caution...not all apps and software are quite ready for the M1 chip / Big Sur yet. I'm still straddling the world of two MacBooks, the older one running High Sierra and the new one running Big Sur, because some of the apps don't work perfectly on the new MacBook. But all in all, it's a good transition for me.

  I bought this for a Christmas gift and it was awesome, until it died. It comes with a cord but not no cube to connect it to the wall. And it doesn’t fit into any standard apple charging cubes. So we had to order one. After we revived it it still would not charge. Just a sad red lightening bolt. Such a disappointment. If after a few days of attempting to trouble slot it doesn’t work I will definitely be retuning it.

  I really like the Apple Watch SE so far. There are some little things that are kind of annoying, but overall the experience has been pretty good. The thing that really bothered me is not the watch itself, but the charger. It comes with the USB-C charger, which if you are someone like me who didn’t know what it was could be annoyed by it. But other that that, I would say that it is so far good.

  I've been using iPads for only about 3 revisions so far. They are wonderful, and I use them constantly. My only complaint about this revisions is that it seems the battery lasts less time than previous ones. That's quite weird though, as I hear good things all the time about the battery life from others. If the iPad is doing any work, it drains rather quickly. Doing this and that though, it lasts longer than the previous average.

  Screen quality is best I have seen on any I-pad. Fastest I-pad I have ever used. Very good battery life.

Camera much improved, although most of my picture taking still done on my phone.

  I love Apple products. The sound of these AirPods is absolutely AMAZING, and the noise cancelation feature is superb. However, none of that matters because they keep falling out of my ears. They come with 3 sizes of cushions, and shipped with large ones on the device, and they are very easy to change out. I tried the medium and the small cushions, but each size falls out of my ears while working out, which is so annoying because I have to keep reaching up to push them in. I was just walking in the grocery store and the one it had in fell out of my ear, I tried to catch it before it hit the floor but wasn't quick enough. There was no way I was going to put it back in my ear until I cleaned it with a disinfectant wipe. So I ended up walking around with an amazing and expensive device meant for my ears in my pocket. Stop moving around you say?.. Well, I was just sitting at my desk eating and suddenly, plop, it just fell out.  It's not the size because I have other earplug devises the stay in my ears perfectly even when I sweat while working out. Oh, the do come with a charging table but not the block, and the battery life is average. So I have to give Apple a thumbs down on this one, because they don't work. I would return them but I got rid of the shipping box. I still have the product box though and it'll make a very pretty storage box.

NotSoFast,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm a cheapie and tend to get $50 earbuds...so when the AirPods Pro went on sale for $150 I took the plunge..,Initial observation is that it's typical Apple well thought out design.  Very slick. The case is tiny and slippery.  First thing I'd recommend is buying a case for the case...see my other reviews,In use it's brainless when pairing with Apple products....and not much harder with non Apple products.  Good thing when using Apple products is if you leave your AirPods and walk away...you get a notification that you left the AirPods...making it less likely to forget them at a coffee shop or something.  There are different size ear pieces to fit most ears...the default one fits me fine.  It's definitely not for work out...they will fall out.,Sound quality is very good....much better than my JL $50 earbuds...but not as good as a high end over ear head set.  There are basically 2 modes....with noise cancellation or transparency.  Transparency mode actually amplifies the surrounding sound...not sure who'd want that.  Noise cancellation is really good, if you fit the earpiece snuggly into your ear canal.  Not as good as good set of Bose/Sony, but very noticeable improvement.  The spacial feature is pretty cool as well.  Basically it puts the source of sound at your iPhone/computer....if you turn your head or walk around, it makes the sound move based on where your source is.,Am I happy with my purchase?  Yes...it's noticeably better than the $50 set....the noise cancellation is really good and much more useful than I'd thought.

Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I took my time before deciding on purchasing these Airpods. I am so happy that I decided to go with these Airpod Pros.,I was tempted to do a third party airpod brand, but happy I made the choice to go with these airpods.,The sound is amazing and the noise cancellation feature is just amazing. I noticed a lot of people complaining about not having an option to adjust the volume only by saying ""Hey Siri"" or adjust the volume on your iphone or device. I have no problem with this and its really not noticeable.,The best thing about these airpod pros is if you have an iphone or other apple devices, its going to pair easily and you are going to unlock a lot of nice features.,Comfortably fits in my air, I don't even notice any kind of irritation or strain in my ears when I am wearing them, and I wear them all day long.,That being said, the charging case, is great! in 5 minutes of charging it practically almost fully charges the airpods pro. I really like this quick charging feature as I can just take 5 mins and have the airpods ready to go.,I highly recommend making the investment on these Apple Airpod Pro.,I want to point out, some people were making me worried saying they were getting fake airpod pros, this was not the case for me, I received genuine airpod pros. There are videos out there showing the fake ones from the real ones, so you can get an idea what to look out for, but I had no problem with Amazon supplying genuine airpod pros, just make sure when you are buying them you buy them NEW! Not used!

  Except in order for them to stay put in my ears I have to twist them n in that position they start to hurt my ears. Using them around the house is fine but moving around a gym you will be picking at least one of them off the floor n if you look around the gym you aren’t the only one with the same problem.

  I normally do not review stuff, but I had I bought these headphones and they stopped working the next day. I took it to the Apple store and they said it was a fake. The serial number does not fully register in their system. I called Apple and the serial number exists but that is not sufficient apparently- most the information that is listed under the number was not present. So if you want to verify take it to the store. Now I know a few people said they are real and dismissed the fakes. What I believe is the likely scenario is that a some fakes have infiltrated so buy at your own risk!

"
Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ridiculed AirPods for years, but I am a reluctant convert. The last few years I’ve been very happy with behind-the-head Bluetooth headsets like Aftershokz, and I still think those are great. But i really, really like these.,The audio quality is great. The carrying case not only helps fast-charge, but it also keeps the buds cleaner than if they were floating around in a pocket or bag. They sense when they’re in your ear, so there’s not even a need to pair them or even turn them on. They seamlessly connect to your iPhone and pairing with other non-Apple devices is straightforward (using a button on the case).,There are three settings for noise cancellation. I find that Active is very comparable to my Bose QC3s which are much bulkier, but last longer. I’d still prefer the bose for flights because of that. Off is still quieter than the regular AirPods since the silicone cups naturally block some sound. And Enhance truly does make it feel like you don’t have them in—at least for nearby sounds. If someone is speaking in front of you, it’s crystal clear; if they’re speaking in another room, not so much.,Cons are twofold— the price, and battery life. I got these on sale with two gift cards and bonus points. I’m not sure I would have sprung for them if I had to pay full freight. Battery life is impressive for the small size, but not even a full workday. They do charge pretty quickly though, so at least both cons have potential mitigations.
"
Georgia Guy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Moving up from AirPods to AP Pro. Sound is a bit better, noise cancellation is great (blew my driveway yesterday; loud blower could hardly be heard) and battery life is much better. However, I don’t like the difficulty I have sliding the pods back in the case (believe me, it ain’t smooth) compared to the 1st generation and I seriously doubt I’ll ever be content with the fit in my ears. I still have a few more weeks to decide to keep or return. I’ll let you know.,Update: I've found a bit more satisfaction with the AirPod Pros recently. Now I have two different size silicon tips in my ears; I discovered that my right ear conforms to a larger tip vs my left ear. So, for simply walking the dog or doing my daily morning exercise walk, the buds stay in pretty good. But if I have to do a lot of head movement (like when I'm reaching down and lifting back up frequently (as in bagging leaves in the front yard)) the buds aren't too long in my ears. I can feel them slowly pulling out. Bottom line? Still have a couple of weeks to see if I can make these things right for me. Again, I'll let you know.

DSloan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I highly recommend this product!,I use these all day for work taking calls, making calls, and in between listing to music. This is my second pair of Apple AirPods, and I also own a few other high-end brands versions as well to compare these with.,The Apple AirPods Pro is by far the superior version all the way around for noise canceling, comfort, battery life, and overall integration.,These are so seamless when pairing to your phone that when a call is coming in; and you do not have the AirPod in your ear, you can pull it out of the case, place it in your ear and still answer the call by the third ring. The sound quality is amazing whether you are listening to music or on a call. With the interchangeable ear-opening tips you are sure to find a size that is comfortable enough to wear all day long and not even notice that it's in your ear. The integration with Siri works very well and reads your incoming texts to you in a very pleasant way. No annoying notification ding in your ear here!
"
Ian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13"" MacBook Pro to the 14"" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13"" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14"" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.,Size: So, 1"" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13"" model, but smaller than the 16"". I had a 16"" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.,Form Factor: The new 14"" and 16"" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.,Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the ""form factor"" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the ""MacBook Pro"" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.,Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.,Performance: My 13"" had the M1 chip and now my 14"" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13"" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.,The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.,The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.,Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27"" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.,Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.,My 13"" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14"" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max.
"
Charlie Carlisle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I haven't upgraded my computer for more than a decade, so it would stand to reason any recent releases would impress me, but this macbook pro has gone above and beyond in the small time I've had it.,The screen is truly something to behold. Smooth, clear, just beautiful. I don't typically care about bezels, but I might start. The expanded screen makes an unexpected difference. Meanwhile, I barely notice the notch. Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.,The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.,In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one. Excited as I was for my last macbook, I could see room for improvement at the time. Right now, I don't see how things get better than this.

Jake,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about ""the notch"" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks ""sharp"" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks.

  I have a Mabook Pro covered by Apple care. The computer needs a new battery. To make a long story short Apple left me for months with a computer, again under warranty, which I can use for a couple of hours for simple tasks like web browsing before it needs to be recharged. Apple refused to replace the battery because the diagnostic read 81% not below 80 % as per policy. In all this Apple didn’t have any problems asking me to invest countless hours of my time between doing clean installs trips to apple stores etc.. I feel a more respectful way to treat me as a loyal customer could have been let us replace the battery first and if that doesn’t fix the issue which I seriously doubt ask me to do troubleshooting. All this to save something that would probably cost you few $$. Seriously ?

  I never write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this Macbook Pro. I've owned macs consistently since 1990s and have dealt with eye strain on the air and now on this laptop. It gave me horrible headaches and eye strain even with a matte protector. I returned it and am now looking at PCs for the first time because if I can't read from the screen without it making me sick, I can't use it.

  I live abroad and had it sent to a friends house in the US while I was visiting. Brought it home in South America and during software update at first use, screen went black. Computer was still on but the screen went black several times. When cold, it works fine but after 5 minutes or so, screen starts blackening completely.,I have registered my issue through CS but cant get support in Peru as the model isnt here yet. Hopefully they will respect the warranty when I go back in July. It will be shut in its box until then

  I bought this for a Christmas gift and it was awesome, until it died. It comes with a cord but not no cube to connect it to the wall. And it doesn’t fit into any standard apple charging cubes. So we had to order one. After we revived it it still would not charge. Just a sad red lightening bolt. Such a disappointment. If after a few days of attempting to trouble slot it doesn’t work I will definitely be retuning it.

  I really like the Apple Watch SE so far. There are some little things that are kind of annoying, but overall the experience has been pretty good. The thing that really bothered me is not the watch itself, but the charger. It comes with the USB-C charger, which if you are someone like me who didn’t know what it was could be annoyed by it. But other that that, I would say that it is so far good.

  I’ve previously owned an Apple Watch (series 1). A lot has changed since then. The set up took me hours. I had to update my iPhone to the lasted iOS. Okay. Then the actual pairing the Watch to my iPhone was time consuming. It keep telling me it wouldn’t pair. It took me quite a while to get it to eventually pair. Now once it “paired” it was once again needing a Watch app update to fully connect.,Another downside. No charging block included. So it costs me another $20 to get a charging block as my iPhone 11 Pro Max was still utilizing the traditional USB to Lightening charging cable and block when I bought it in 2019.,Battery life. Much lower than my previous Apple Watch and even my Fitbit. Chargers fast but definitely needs charging every 24-36 hours. Which makes it hard to utilize the sleep tracking option.,Once I got passed all this, I have really enjoyed the Watch. Next time I hope the process goes more smoothly. I don’t remember back in 2015/2016 it taking this long or difficult to set up. And if I remember correctly I also got a charging block AND cable.,**Please excuse any typos

Stpete28,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I just upgraded from a S3, and to be honest I have a hard time finding the improvements. The screen, because of the rolled edges and the way text kind of rolls off the side, looks strange and gives the impression your using a 3rd party app that wasn’t designed for your system. But you’re not, it’s Apple. The ECG system is honestly the only reason I bought the watch and love that feature. If you don’t need the ECG, stay with the SE or S6 as that one does not utilize the rolled edges.
"
Jerome Yyy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Kinda small compare to 44mm,The main issue is it limit too much:,I can’t change or design the watch face freely, or those simple design need some third party app.,The notification also too limited, when I using  my phone, I can not get vibrate from the watch anymore, that lead a problem is,1. when turn on “do not disturb”, all silenced like no watch;,2. when I planned get notification from watch shake and accidentally open my phone, loud noise from my phone come out - due to some app’s bad design I can’t use silence mode if I want to hear something.,??????????????,I know Apple like to make decisions for customers, but not this one.,Maybe blame bad app developers who silence their app when phone at silence mode &when there is a positive media volume.

Kathy L. Cluggish,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the feature of the screen staying on without wrist movement. Watch charges fast and the battery life is better than the older Series 3 I had. I previously had the 42mm and debated on the 41mm vs the 45mm. Went with the 41mm because I have small wrists and it's hard to get bands to fit. I do not miss the 1mm difference from my old watch. There is increased screen size on the Series 7 which makes up for the size difference. I also love the new features. Definitely a winner.
"
Gentleman Jim,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch has been an interesting investment.  I bought it for several reasons.  I liked the ECG function since I do have a genetic heart valve problem.  The ability to get my heart rate by locking into the gym's treadmill is a great feature.  The one feature that I wanted that the watch does not have is sleep monitoring.  I wanted to know how long I actually slept and how deeply.  The watch either does not have that feature or I have not found it yet.  Not using that feature does allow me to charge the watch overnight.  And, what the heck is it with Apple that they sell you an overpriced watch and then are too cheap to supply a charger.  Get real!

  Applications that are Apple M1 compliant are so ridiculously faster than their Intel counterparts, it’s pointless to even bother comparing.,(I had to purchase this as my awesome trusty 2009 17”MacBookPro decided to die one day),1mth Update: Things to consider:,My old 17” had every port imaginable, and with ExpressCard I had all the modern USB3/Thunderbolt,I am not sure if a 13” will ever be my daily driver… As soon as I get the Tantalum capacitor replacement to repair my 17” I will likely go back to it as my primary and always have this one as my spare or if I need serious processing speed. That said, if my 17” won’t resurrect from large paperweight status, the new 16” M1 would be my choice to replace it.,My own Performance Analysis.,One of my Applications Analyzes gigantic data, my old 17” (Core2duo2.8) used to take 22min42sec per process output completion, my iMacPro did it in 4min19sec, and this M1 took 13seconds.

  This is my very first Mac. It was the value for the price (strange to describe an Apple product that way) and the performance of Apple's new M1 chip that finally compelled me to buy my first Mac. And I'm glad I did. This machine is awesome. It's my baby now. It's so good! Part of it no doubt is the novelty is using MacOS instead of Windows 10, but I really love my new MacBook Pro!
"
Zach Nichols,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this laptop primarily for college. As someone who has dealt with both devils by the name of Apple and Microsoft, the operating system differences don't bother me (although, one thing I did find is that when I go home and I'm not able to do any gaming, it can be a bit of an irritation, but that was never why I bought this laptop to begin with). The screen and battery life on this thing are amazing. My previous laptops had terrible screens and had a max battery life of about two hours. This laptop, between using it for school, doing photo editing, graphic design, coding, and video editing, can easily last me up to two days or even more. The one thing I will say is that frequently in order for me see things most of the time, I need the screen cranked up past 50% brightness most of the time. I like the touch bar, I barely use function keys in most applications and the apps that do use them have the buttons on the touch bar anyways. I will say though unless you care about the touch bar, a slightly larger battery, and a fan being inside this machine (which for the record, with all of my use of heavy exports and edits, has never once turned on), just buy the MacBook Air. For school especially, it will get you across fine. The 8 GB model is also superb in most of the tasks I need to accomplish. I mean, it has similar performance in what I need for compared to my PC with a Ryzen 3700X, and RTX 3070, and 32GB of RAM. There were a couple of times where webpages tried to use more than 8GB of RAM and that caused some trouble, but after turning on an ad-blocker I never had that issue again. macOS has superb memory management, which allows for someone semi-professional like me to get by with it just fine.

  I love my MBP! As a Windows user since the early 90's, I've gone through all sorts of computer systems; desktops and laptops, name-brand pre-built systems and custom builds and I've got to say, Apple knows how to construct an absolutely gorgeous and solid device with premium build quality. My interest in Windows began waning after Windows 7 and has been a downward spiral since, in terms of user experience, maintenance, bugs, endless updates, updates for those updates, etc. I was not going to stick around for another lackluster release with Windows 11 on the way (which my fairly new and high-end laptop at the time didn't even officially qualify for the upgrade). The learning curve was not too steep and has been more rewarding in the past several weeks of use. I forget how much of a pleasure it was to use a computer that the developers actually understand the needs of the customer base. I am equally amazed by just how seamlessly everything just seems to work. I used to think in terms of Apple monopolizing the market by offering a product that they built both on the hardware and software side, but that is in part why it just works so flawlessly.

  Nowadays is ridiculous that a good Windows system can be as expensive as a Mac computer, or vice versa, a Mac now is as affordable as a Windows PC. This new micro, the M1 series is amazing, run fast, no lagging, and with the rest of the integrated Masc hardware I am fascinated with the performance, no matter I am just writing a book or editing videos on Premiere, or even making a complex podcast with Audition or Reaper.,Wit my previous Windows machines I was experimentan lot of lagging issues and considering build or buy new computer were expensive and complicated. Now the Macbook Pro solved all in one single package.,I am delighted with the number of hours I can be working on the go, one single charge last all day long, checking emails, editing audio, writing, translating, chatting and all with a great Keyboard, that we must admit is not a mechanical one, but makes a very decent job for a 1 mm travel on each keystroke.,I am so happy that my Mac is so versatile and powerful in one small package that I am considering getting rid of all my Windows PC get another couple of Macs and continuing with my new style of working hours on the go or in any other place I like bringing just one small device but powerful with stounding battery life. Worth to mention the finishes are superb and make it thought for travelling.,Finally, the OS is amazing, I have almost no trouble moving from one to the other, I am surprised that Mac OS comes with all the things to start working just opening the lid of the computer, everything is suitable to start working or creating something, something now I really hate on PCs is the number of hours I had to spent setting up the OS, later installing programs, setting my preferences and son on, now all that days have gone with Mac OS.,These finals words are for you. my friend:,If you are like me, an old school tech guy that loves setting RAID arrays, tunning the BIOS, picking every component by hand, dealing with BUS speeds, got issues on the registró and spent hundreds of hours on forums asking questions about performance and incompatibilities with your stuff, please don't hesitase to move to Mac OS. On this Side, everything is simple but powerful and you can be more focused on producido that supports your systems. As many people have told me before buying a Mac I can share with you it's real... ""when you get a Mac you won't get back to windows"". It happened to me in just 14 days.

  Starting in the early 2000's I became a strictly Apple girl for all electronic devices. I love the easy integration between devices and as a person with a disability it means a lot to have that interconnect-ability. I previously had a Macbook Pro from 2015 and it was malfunctioning badly. The replacement cost exceeded its value so invested that repair cost into this Macbook Pro. it's come a long way since 2015! I love how light weight it is, I swear it's lighter than my Macbook Air from 2010 was. I like the touch display but I mainly only use it for emojis 🙂. I had Big Sur on my previous Mac but it ran slow. This Macbook works so much faster than what I had before. The screen is brilliant and gorgeous. I had read this Macbook could run any app on my phone. The reality is it's only a few apps. What I wanted to work the most was Instagram, and that does not work on this. There are several apps though and that's a nice feature.,I'm not techie from a hardware position but I am an advanced user from a software perspective and I am really happy with this this.

  I am an Apple technology fan and this is my third Mac. It has worked perfectly and does not have the loud fan sound I read about re: some other models. I do miss the break-away magnetic charger. The Mac 2020 uses a USB-3 plug. I also miss having a USB port!  I did not want to buy a new keyboard and monitor and Passport back up, which all work just fine, so I had to purchase a J5 USB-C 3.1 hub with 3 USB ports and a VGA port. My dongle is now obsolete with this computer. The computer arrived in perfect shape and working order and Amazon has the best price I could find for it. If you have never tried a Mac, you will love it.

  La compré en abril, pero la comencé a usar recién en mayo 2021. A comienzos de setiembre comenzó a fallar el touchbar y ese mismo día se apagó y no volvió a encender.,El servicio técnico dice que es un fallo eléctrico y tendrán que cambiar varias partes, incluyendo la batería, el touch bar, el teclado, etc. Es decir, una computadora de casi 1500 requiere un mantenimiento bastante grande luego de solo 4 meses de uso.,Me parece bastante mal. Obviamente, desde donde estoy es imposible comunicarse directamente con la empresa. La página web dice que siempre está ocupada y el servicio técnico hace que los clientes firmen un documento que, básicamente, sirve para que no haya opción a reclamar. Es más, si no dejo que la reparen, estoy obligado a pagarles por el diagnóstico.,No puedo recomendar un producto tan caro que se estropee tan rápido.

  I would have chosen another color, but this was available.  The sports band feels like skin and is extremely comfortable.,I got the watch to track my health readings  during sleep.  My CPAP was under FDA recall not to use.  So I was monitoring my O2 level sleeping without CPAP.  O2 levels were dangerously low so I got another CPAP and they came up to normal levels.  The watch clearly showed this.,The watch has so many more features that I may sometime use.  I recommend the series 7 watch.

  if you've never used apple watch before, please note that it's in general a one-day watch. If that's a dealbreaker, you should look somewhere else.,This watch is absolutely beautiful. The screen is bright and texts are crisp. It's blazingly fast compared to my apple watch 4. Thanks to the bigger screen we can view more information on the watch face. I thoroughly enjoy all the smart features apple brings to this watch and its ecosystem. Think of this apple watch as a mini iphone but can track a lot of fitness features and health info. If you are interested in heart rate, The Quantified Scientist youtube channel did a thorough study and showed that this watch's hr is very accurate.,I put the charger on my desk and when I work I leave it there for charging. It's charged super quick, like 15m or so and I never ran out of battery. For daily life of WFH, my watch's battery is always 90%. My usage is checking notification every now and then a roughly 1hr of workout (indoor so no gps).,if you have an apple watch 4, the only main diff I'd say here is the spo2 sensor. If that's not important to you, I think it's not worth the upgrade though because the apple watch 4 is still very very fast.

  This is my first Apple Watch, so far I’m loving the convenience of it. However….. after 4 hours last night and 3 hours on the phone this morning with Verizon technical support (3 different tiers of folks) - I still don’t have cellular functionality on the watch, which is the whole reason I purchased this one! Very frustrating and time consuming to say the least. Hopefully the bugs will get worked out quickly.

  This is apparently the best smart watch for iPhone owners and it is a great watch.  While it is disappointing that Apple doesn't include a power adapter for most devices, just plan on spending the extra money to get yourself a USB-C adapter when you buy any new Apple products.  The overall app integration and health features make this a great watch and daily companion.  If you want your daily step count to appear on the watch face, you need to download a pedometer app and then add the steps to your watch face setup, but once you do that it's a great feature.  It will probably take several months to learn 50% of the watch features, but so far it looks great.

  I’ve always been a smart watch user, however, being that I recently converted to Apple after finding that I enjoy their products and software, I needed a new watch.,This product is beautiful. The screen is high resolution, it’s fast, and you can seamlessly transfer between phone and watch. The screen is small, but it displays a lot more information at once than I really expected it to, so using it isn’t a headache.,I love the utility. Everything you think a smart watch should do, this watch CAN do. From needing a calculator, to switching your songs, tracking your activity & workouts- basing the calories burned on your heart rate. I exercise a lot and appreciate the information smart watches can bring. You can text, call, read emails, make payments. Etc.,The only issue I have with the watch is an issue I have with apple products in general- if you’re like me and this is your first apple watch- you’re probably going to have to watch a tutorial or two in order to know how to turn it on, and to know what this watch can really do for you. Apple does offer “helpful tips” but those tips aren’t really comprehensive as to how to use your watch. I probably still don’t know all I can do with it, which is cool, but frustrating.

Beastsefus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really like the series 7, I had the 6 so not much difference in overall functionality however the screen is noticeably larger, more smoothed out and rounded. I was a bit disappointed in what they are calling green. While it is not black, it is not black like navy blue isn't black and yet is called blue. The green is there, but it is not even as green as the phones are. But I would buy again regardless as I do really enjoy the larger size.

In Search of Value,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's extremely irritating that Apple will send you a $400 watch with absolutely no way to charge it. It's so exhausting how they keep changing things like this to force you to buy new accessories. They didn't bother to include the required USB-C power adapter with the watch, something that almost no one actually has. So you need to shell out another $20 and hope your watch, with horrendous battery life, doesn't die before you can get one. Either give us a power cord you can plug into a standard USB driver or give us an adapter with a USB-C plug. This is really ridiculous.

Gary Lecureux,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is only day 2 of my apple smart watch. So far the capacity of the series 7 far out weighs the fitbit versa 2 accept it doesn't seem to collect as much sleep data as the fitbit did. I have insomnia and liked seeing when I got a good nights sleep but overall this watch has a lot more to offer. I am new to it so I will most likely come back to modify this review. As usual the setup was pretty intuitive. Remember if you are looking for data collected to look in the Apple Health App that comes with your iphone. I love tekky stuff so this watch will keep me busy for a while. I paid almost 3 times as much for the Apple watch as I did my versa 2 so I am expecting a lot more. I may adjust the star ratings as I become more aquanted with the watch. I was a little disappointed in the charging cable not including the power adaptor. It has a magnetic end that attaches to the watch, which is nice because if you use a screen protector you won't have to  remove it to charge the watch. The other end however is a type-C and I had  no power adaptors with a type-C. I was able to  charge it with my tablet and I also have a couple of portable power supplies that have type-C so I am good until my new power adaptor arrives. I was reading in a forum and another person complained about the same thing and someone pointed out that it is our responsibilty to find out what's in the box. That's true but for that price I still think you should get one with the watch. Apple claims it's to help the enviornment. Power adaptors sometimes get legs and walk away on there own so I think it best to provide one.

  Size is perfect for carrying around. Performance is more than enough for me. Everything is good but there are definitely places need to improve. For example, fingerprint reader reads my fingerprint slower than the iPad Air 3 does and the bezel seems little too thick comparing to the screen itself. Overall, it’s a good products that still has places to be improved.

I use my pro for more heavy work and investment research etc. Form factor for gaming this is wY better than the pro, especially if u are used to gaming on a switch. The only downfall is the battery. You will have to charge it every day. In some ways i wish it had wireless charging

  I love this IPad.  I was a little concerned that the size would be too small coming from an IPad Air.  But I bought it primarily to run Gaia GPS for off roading.  It works perfect for that.  The smaller screen hasn’t been a problem either.  The resolution is so crystal clear that the picture pops!  So far, I have not experienced the jelly scrolling effect others have mentioned.  Highly recommended.

  I love it but it is not for everyone. The volume buttons are in a annoying spot and the software is not optimized for it yet. I love the screen the feel of the new build. Fingerprint is good cameras are good enough for video calls speakers are very good over all I’m very happy but like I said it’s not for everyone.

  Beast tablet I’ve ever owned. I actually got it to replace my computer and Nintendo switch. I was skeptical if it could but I wanted to give it a try. It totally did. I use an iPad stand along with a wireless keyboard and mouse to replace my MacBook. And I also take it on the go super easy. The games are good enough to replace the tablet mode of my Nintendo switch as well so for me it’s like 3 devices in 1. Well worth the money as it saved me on a new laptop and video game system. Quality is amazing and the Apple Pencil makes you forget about using paper and notebooks ever again. If you’re on the fence about buying, don’t be. Get it. You won’t regret it.

  Apple did a great job with the update. While I like the Touch ID, face recognition would be better.,You get plenty of screen without feeling like your carrying a small TV.,The camera tracking in FaceTime is awesome.
"
PolkHigh33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A huge performance upgrade over my Mini 2.,But, the screen isn’t really noticeably nicer. The new Mini is heavier and thicker. You cannoti use lightning ear buds, and it was crazy expensive compared to the full size iPad.,It’s a shame that the smaller mini costs more than the full size iPad, but that smaller tablet is the perfect size.
"
Alan White,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple always has a way of making their devices feel and look premium. The iPad mini 6 is fast and reliable. A decent camera in the front and the back is a plus. It came with iOS 15.1 and it feel so fluid. I just love holding it and even the fact that it supports Apple Pencil 2. As a writer and drawer, this was just icing on the top.
"
pablo.station,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Battery life is average (for what I do, I can kill it pretty quick). Screen is great, and build is top notch. I knew what I was getting into, being a previous ipad pro owner. Best tablet ever made IMO.

  Got a ""scratched"" ipad for the first time, Amazon quickly replaced it for me.,Comparing to my old 2018 ipad, this is a huge improvement, love the LiDAR scanner, used it on daily basis for my projects to scan the room!,overall, great! and plus the discount for 100 off, it is very good!
"
S.theMan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple does not discount its product all the time, so when I bought it cheaper, I feel better.,I like everything except the weight. Compared to the previous ipad (1st gen) I had, this one is heavier, but i am not carrying it with me all the time, so i am still okay with it.
"
G. Speck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  With IOS 15 I can use this wor do most all of the tasks of my MacBook Pro. No complaints. My only issue was my hitting my thumb on the trackpad while using zoom moved the window on my screen. Just put a business card on it and problem was solved. Great display and good audio. LOVE IT.
"
IHeartAmazonPrime,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a gorgeous ipad and works perfectly for the Procreate app (pro tip- add a matte screen protector and get an apple pencil!!!). I won't go into the technical aspect because I'm sure some other fancy reviewer has done that in detail below, but I am very happy with my purchase. #TeamApple

  Awesome product.  Expensive, but worth it.  I had a 2014 IPad Air 2 and this is not only better, but has a more vivid picture.  Again, expensive, though.  This is the fifth generation IPad Pro.  Save yourself some money and get the fourth generation at Best Buy.  To me, little to no difference
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  12.9 is rather large Screen, yet this tablet is not as heavy as my iPad Air gen4.  It is thin.  M1 is fast.  I chose 12.9 solely because of the ProMotion.  Battery life is impressive.  I love Apple now switched to USB Type C. Finally I dumped all my Kindle Fire devices.

  I thought maybe I was technologically challenged; just couldn’t get used to my new MacBook Air.  Now that I’ve reverted to an IPad I’m much happier; I have my touch screen again and I’m enjoying the sharp, bright screen image.  There’s a lot to discover in this new model and I’ve only just started exploring.  I think that in a few months I’ll be able to confirm that I love it!
"
R. Perrelet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This laptop has a superior display, superior speakers, superior camera and an excellent keyboard. Don't go cheap and buy the ""affordable"" MacBook Air base model like some of these talking heads have been advising. It's not a good buy if you are unhappy with it after six months, and believe me, you will be unhappy with 8 GB of RAM and two USB ports after six months. M1 MacBooks are not upgradeable so if you find that you need more RAM, you are stuck. Unless all you are doing sending emails, tweets, and watching TicTok, you will probably need something more, especially if you are using your laptop for work. I'm using my MacBook Pro with an LG UltraFine 5K 27 inch display as my desktop system, which replaces a 27 inch iMac. I'm very happy.
"
bwlistener,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The upgrade from my 2014 Macbook Pro was easy, as one expects from Apple.  The new display is noticeably brighter.  My zoom meetings look like I'm in a brighter space.  I bought a USB-C (thunderbolt 3) to USB adaptor so I could use my old Time Machine drive.  Although I moved from a 15"" display down to a 14"" display, the smaller size is no problem, perhaps because the colors are so bright.
"
Cody,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This macbook is assum. A bit of a challenge learning their OS after 15 years on windows but it was worth the buy.  The M1 is powerful and does heavy 4k video rendering without getting warm.  This blows away anything Intel has.  It runs Microsoft 365 so all my files are avaliable on one drive.  The video screen is assum and perfect colors.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy this you won't be dissapointed.
"
Mahdi Farhat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Its My First Macbook pro after my late 2015 Macbook,And i love it..,the difference between the two screens may not appear to be significant, but in my opinion, it is.  The screen feels significantly larger in a package that isn't significantly larger.,The keyboard is so much fun to use it..,the notch didn't affect my usage at all.. and sometimes i forget its there
"
t.thompson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I knew something was wrong when I opened the box and the laptop was not covered in plastic. Then when you tried to set it up, there was already someone else’s Apple ID LOCKED  into the laptop. Surprise! Totally useless. When ordered, there was no indication that it was refurbished or old. Be sure to check all information regarding your purchase before buying. If it’s not packaged correctly, send it back.
"
Flo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  To be very fair any laptop would have been a upgrade for me. Haven't purchased one since 2014. But this MacBook in the 14"" is great. Ready to use it to it's full potential. Also ready for more options of cases and sleeves to be available.
"
EK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely loving this MacBook. My best purchase of 2021 for sure! Yes, it’s expensive. But it seriously performs well. It can handle lots of open tabs and windows and handles my workload like a semi truck. In other words it feels powerful and capable and has stood up to my usability test. Love the aesthetic design as well… oh ya and the battery lasts me all day - worth the money right almost exclusively for that!
"

  Super fast laptop with great battery life.  Lightweight with amazing screen and speakers.  Recommend a USB C hub, as many common ports are missing and it’s not convenient to carry around multiple dongles for each external device.

wildin mota,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first time with a MacBook laptop after been using Windows and Linux and I actually love it. M1 chip introduction last year got my attention and when I decided to buy it, this one was about to release so I just wait and have no regrets about.,I just love the screen and overall design of the laptop, the performance is excellent too I haven't experienced any problems.,The only concern I could have is compatibility, I'm a software engineer but I've been able to run everything so far with the help of Rosetta 2.
"
el_gigantor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It is small, light, and fast.  Has an excellent screen.  And for such a small light computer I do like all the ports that it has.  Of course I had to get all new cables/adapters since none of the ports on my old MacBook Pro matched.  This Macbook has no USB A port, so you will need an adapter to read that stack of USB flash drives that you have, or that friends and colleagues send you.  But I do prefer the Thunderbolt 4 ports to USB.

  I mean, I get it...  If it was the standard (old) plug and brick that takes a USB, I have a million of those around the house.  But it's the new 20W USB-C, and if you haven't purchased a new device in the past year or two, you probably don't have a bunch of spares laying around.  Just trying to make an extra buck?  WTH.  When you sell a new device, sent it with all of the necessary pieces!!!  Irritating.

   This watch is really great. I switched from a Fitbit to Apple Watch when I got an iPhone. Overall I love the product and the way it feels on my wrist. My only downfall for me is the battery life. It says it lasts for 18 hours but it seems to die quickly for me. My Fitbit could go 3-4 days without charging. Apart from that though I would highly recommended this watch!!

Four eye Tex,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch arrived with a. dead battery. After a three hour charge using a USB-C charger which I had also purchased, the watch remained charged for less than 15 minutes. It is charging now overnight but surely a brand new watch battery is supposed to be a little charged then recharge easily. After 4 days, It now recharges fine. The ECG app is extremely poor and Blood Oxgen is very slow compared to pulse oximeter. I bought for these features. Apple does say not for “medical “ purposes. I am not a fitness freak. I am learning to use features that require purchase of additional software that helps me. Pay attention to your purposes for buying this watch. I hated it but have learned to use certain additional software to my benefit and am having no more battery problems so I am now pleased.

  This is my very 1st apple watch and so I got the GPS version because I did not know if I would like it or not or really use it and now, I'm happy I ordered This!,I find myself using this for everything now and almost never take my phone out of my pocket when I am out on the go I can read all my Facebook messages and my text messages form the watch! although one thing I don't like is that when I get the message it pops up the message on the watch as soon as I get it so others can read it if you don't look right away and read or clear it from notifications think it may be a setting or something that could be fixed with an update but have not really looked at all the settings on the watch yet just used it as is after setting up.

EngineerGuy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After spending $800 for this thing, I had to spend another $20 to get a USB-C charger cube. I must have 20 USB-A cubes, but this is not compatible. Of all the zillion devices I have, none need a USB-C female charging outlet. I understand why USB-C is needed, but not to include a charger cube?,With the battery arriving DOA, I had to charge it from my laptop which was not very convenient since my laptop USB-C port is used for several other purposes.,They must have saved $2. Oh ... add it right to the bottom line.,There are also no instructions included whatsoever.,What a bad first impression.,Setup took over two hours with required updates, downloads, authorizations, pairings, log-ins, etc. I suppose a lengthy setup is understandable ... but did I mention no charger and no instructions? I'm not likely to get over that. Really ... how cheap can you get Apple?,It is interesting to note that I got a 31 page printed manual along with my Apple branded USB-C charger cube I had to order, but absolutely nothing along with my watch!!,How cheap can you get Apple? How cheap can you get?,It's an amazing device, but products that don't present themselves well when opening the box are doomed to failure in the market. I am both upset with and shocked at Apple for this.,3 stars is all you get. All the incredible engineering that went into this was lost on me immediately by the decisions made by some idiot product/marketing manager.,I am soooo done with Apple products.

  I have had for a couple of months and I could not be happier. Apple, of course, packaged well, and who doesn't like the ceremonious unboxing from anything Apple. Blazingly fast, lightweight, and significantly improved battery life. The M1 chip was a chief reason for my purchase, after a long wait (My previous model is 4 years old - still working well!) but work from home and all the cash I saved from not ordering in lunch every day made the buy an easy decision. Happy customer.

  Good MacBook. I owned a 2013 prior to this and vowed to get macbooks for their superior performance.,I rated this a 4 because I had some eye strain which was of great irritance. However I just turned off the True Colors and changed the background to a softer color. Problem solved.,I also didn't appreciate that now it uses a USB-C type dock. So now I have to get new adapters and wires to connect it's Thunderbolt 3 to other devices).  It took me a good three weeks to figure everything out.,Despite this I love the sound and picture quality. The touch bar is cool too.,** UPDATE after 3 months of use,I can't handle the heavy eye fatigue caused from this new macbook. To be honest, I think my vision got worst after using this mac.  I'm a teacher, so I must look at my screen a lot.  Comparing it to another macbook that I owned (a MacBook pro 2013 which I got replaced with this M1), I got very little eye fatigue from it.  Also the design doesn't work if you add a case to it.  A case would prevent you to effectively use the USB c ports as the bottom part of a case would interfere with it.
"
M L,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Don't be fooled by 'USB-C'. Apple wants you to buy more of their products. There is no HDMI port, there is no USB port. There are two plug ins that are not compatible with anything useful except the charging cord. Apple does this intentionally to force you to buy more of their products.

WSSizer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had the new M1 MacBook Pro for several months now, and I have to say that it lives up to all of the superlative reviews it received. As expected, the most noticeable improvement is its speed, which is in another league from my 2012 Mac. Battery life is excellent, and the automatic day/night screen change works very well. Although some prefer the standard control bar on the MacBook Air, I think the automatic control bar on the new Pro is really neat. I also like the larger touch pad on the Pro vs the one on the Air. All things considered, the new MacBook Pro is a great value, especially at the Amazon sale price.

  I am a big fan of MacBooks. This was my fourth one in the past 10 years.  This one was a LEMON. It worked fine at first but began to freeze on booting. Called Apple three times and walked thorough reloading the IOS and erasing the entire system to reinstall. It then went black screen. Took it to the Apple store and was told in two minutes to send it back.  Tried to exchange it for another but apparently you don't have more in stock. Still a fan but sometimes you get a LEMON and are unable to make lemonade.

  I’ve been a lifelong user of Windows PC and Linux. Until Big Sur and the M1 chip came out I’ve been hesitant to try Macs, so I first got my toes wet by getting an iPhone 12 earlier this year (also a long time Android user). Having used an iPhone for over 6 months now and being very pleased by its performance I felt encouraged to try one of these new MacBooks, and let me tell you, it did not let me down.,I think the level of thinking and detail that went into designing this device is out of this world. You have to give credit where credit is due: this is the most well designed high performance laptop I’ve ever used.,10/10 would recommend.

Roi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch 7 packaging consists of two standalone boxes for your selected watch and band, wrapped together. The watch performs great, and the extra screen space makes a difference. The keyboard functionality actually works even for my relatively big fingers. The bigger watch works perfectly with bands that marked for the 44mm ( even seem like a better fit to the wristcam camera bands). I believe the apps needs updating as most of them have some funky behavior with the new keyboard and voice functionality. Will probably change to 5 stars soon when that happens - but basically do not assume full screen or keyboard for older watch apps without an update.

  Lots more info and options than the under $100 fitness watches. Really enjoying Fitness+ workout options. Doubt I will ever go back to a lesser model. Battery life isn’t what i had hoped/expected. Requires a daily charge. Fortunately, it’s a rapid recharge. As far as accuracy, often doesn’t recognize that I am standing and have been for several hours simply because my arms aren’t moving enough while working at my standing desk. It does provide notice, though, so i can flap my arms and achieve my rings. Good motivation overall. It’s a lot of money compared to other fitness watches, but it’s worth it!

megan hoosier,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been using the watch for almost a week. The charge only lasts around 18 hours. It does charge in about 45 minutes but definitely doesn’t stay charged as long as the Fitbit.  The ekg works great, and I feel the 02 sensor is pretty accurate.  Make sure to order the C charging plug if you don’t already have one or you won’t have anything to plug the charging cord to and your watch will die while you’re waiting.

  Why the heck wouldn’t you include the usb c charger with this watch?  Just plain ridiculous!  Especially for the cost of the item!!!,The band stinks. I have lost the watch due to poor design of band.  The part that lightly snaps into hole does not hold well at all.  Come on Apple people, think long term.,Now, I have to say I didn’t know until I read info on this watch but it comes from China. Apple…the us citizen s could use these jobs. Don’t you think?  Therefore, this will be my very last Apple product purchase.

  I resisted buying a Apple Watch...I don't know why since I have been using iPhones, iPads, MacBook Pros for years.  Possibly because I don't usually wear a watch much anymore.  But that has changed with the Series 7 Watch.  Seamless integration with my iPhone and the features are awesome!!  I was not sure about the band, but I'm beginning to like it more everyday I wear the watch.  The altimeter is accurate, and the heart monitor appears to be spot on as well!  Another awesome Apple product!

  I’m very excited to have this device finally and just received it a few days ago and this evening I got a chance to put the screen guard on it. I opened up the box and took the wrapping off to find weird greasy finger prints and food stains on the glass. I have no idea how this happened but at the factory level. It could had been a quality control unit to test and just packaged up. Still feel weird on and not sure if I should keep it or ask for another.

  I transitioned to this iPad Pro 2021 from a Kindle Fire 10 HD 2017. It’s a major upgrade obviously, but I do think the Kindle Fire is an excellent unit for the price.,The iPad Pro is something you graduate to. It’s lightning fast, crazy responsive, and just a joy to use. Multitasking is so easy. iPad OS is really intuitive. I look forward to using it each day.,When it comes to purchasing Apple products, it’s best to just go ahead and buy the newest model and let it last you for years (I use the same logic with cases- just go ahead and get the Magic Keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio, whichever fits your needs). It’ll resell well when the time comes to upgrade, and you’ll enjoy having the best of the best for at least several months.,This is a great investment at a great price. It shipped about 3 weeks earlier than estimated at the time of my purchase. I’m a satisfied customer.

  There isn’t much to say about an iPad that hasn’t been said already but I love this thing.,I’ve had an iPad since the first gen came out and this is the best generational leap in a long time. I’ve draw on it with the Apple Pencil for countless hours, use face tracking for ar applications, photo editing, media consumption. It’s just such a good all around device. Sure, I wish there was professional apps now that it has the M1 chip but that chip just makes everything a breeze. I can have a ton of layers in procreate and the blending/smudging doesn’t miss a beat like it did on my last iPad. I cant say enough good things. iOS 15 will fix some of my basic gripes so I wont even get into those. This still is not a computer replacement but it’s the best companion to your computer that you can get.

  A great, fast system.  But once again Apple pushes forward and leaves older systems to fend for themselves.  If you have iTunes on an older computer that only supports USB-A connector then you will have a lot of challenges.  Once you get a cable the works (tried the Apple version of an adapter and just wasted $20.  Found a $3 Hanson’s cable that worked.), the rate of transfer is exceedingly slow.,Once you finally get the system set up and working the way you like it, then it is really fantastic.  (Granted updating your pictures and music is a drag, but movies, reading, work files are much smoother and I love the Magic keyboard.).,I figure Apple will slowly fix the issues (they usually do), but time will be a factor.

  I did not give 5 star because compared to 2020 ipad pro 11'', this one has limited upgrade which mainly is the M1 chip. In my view the A12Z is already an overkill for majority of people so M1 is not worth the extra money to upgrade. Instead, buy the 12.9'' with screen upgrade.

  I do love this iPad - having upgraded from an antique iPad 2, this new iPad itself is a beautiful piece of work.  But..... I feel I have to voice my opinion about how Apple is forcing us to buy more stuff such as a subscription to Apple Music.  I'm so angry that my iTunes songs from the old iPad won't transfer to the new iPad.  Oh sure, the songs I purchased through Apple's iTunes do transfer but not the hundreds of albums/cd's/tapes I converted and loaded to iTunes. I did that with an Apple product and yet the new iPad won't accept them.  And there are some games I had on the old iPad that I enjoyed (ad free) but they won't transfer either - I'm forced to download a newer version of the same game which throws ads at me that are longer than the amount of time they let me play.  Play for 30 seconds, sit through 1+ mins of ads.  I'm keeping the iPad 2 for some things and also the new iPad 2020 11inch for most other things.

  This is a great iPad Pro especially for someone moving up from an older pro. M1 chip is great! Can’t believe the battery life I’m getting! This is the latest for the 11” pro screen—2021 3rd gen. For 12.9” pro screen—2021 5th gen. And yes, the 12.9 pro screen is nicer. But I’m not interested in that size. Got a good price on this one! Getting a free Apple Pencil 2 also. I do wish the 512gb one came with 16gb ram. But, it’s not slow so……I guess it’s doesn’t matter. Research showed if you have a 2020 11 pro, don’t upgrade. I think the software upgrade from 15.1 in the future will make this pro 11 version with the M1 chip even better. Forgot to mention, transfer from my old pro to this one took only about 10 minutes and copied everything. You can watch YouTube videos to see how easy it is if you don’t know.

C,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This 9th Gen iPad (2021) only got a few upgrades over the previous version, but is still the least expensive iPad option.,Upgrades over 2020 version:,-A13 Bionic Chip:  Previous version had A12 chip,-Storage:  Now has either 64GB or 256GB, previous version was 32GB or 128GB,-Selfie Camera:  Now has 12MP ultrawide front camera, previous version was 1.2MP standard front camera,-Center Stage:  Front camera follows you to keep you centered in the frame, not available in previous version,-True Tone:  Adjusts color temperature to match environment, not available in previous version,So, of these features, the most noticeable upgrade is probably the improved front-facing camera.  This makes for better looking video calls and selfie photos, and the Center Stage camera tracking feature might be useful if you move around on video calls.  The A13 chip is supposed to be up to 20% faster also, although I haven't really noticed that much of a difference so far.,Besides those upgrades I listed, everything else is almost exactly the same as the 2020 version of the regular iPad.  Same exact build, screen resolution, brightness, rear camera, speakers, battery, lightning charger port, and only support for Gen 1 Pencil (NOT Gen 2 Pencil).  There is no gold color available this year either.,So to summarize, this 9th generation iPad is really just slightly faster, with more storage and a better front facing camera.  The True Tone feature isn't that noticeable to me really, and since the screen brightness wasn't upgraded, it still seems a bit dim at 500nits when you are outside on a bright day.,Having said that, this is still the least expensive option for an iPad.  Apple is discontinuing the previous generation version from last year, so if you are looking for the cheapest iPad, this will be the one for the next 12 months or so.  At this price it is not at all a bad deal, I just wish it supported the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil, or at least had a USB-C port like the new Mini.  For now, I would not recommend upgrading from last years regular iPad, unless you absolutely need the better front camera.

Zen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  iPad is my go to device, other than my work computer. I use it for everything. From watching TV/Movies, to sketching to reading magazines, and everything else.,Background: I currently own 4 iPads (12.9 inch iPad Pro 2015, 12.9 inch iPad Pro 2021, iPad 2018, and now 2021 iPad 10.2)  and have owned several others before, and a Surface Pro, a recent Surface Book, and 2 Kindle Fire tablets so I can say with confidence I am a tablet user. :-) Tablets are how I consume my content and though I've given other devices a chance I keep coming back to iPads due to the intuitive interface and not having to worry about the device,  and just enjoy my content.,Why I like this iPad 10.2 inch:,Why did I get this one despite owning a 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 inch?,This size of iPad is at the right price point and it has the right features, to make it my everywhere in the home, backyard, and travel companion. This is the one I don't have to worry about losing vs. my 2021 iPad Pro 1 TB that was just under $2K. The size makes it super convenient to carry around to read in a park or on the plane, do a quick FaceTime call while reading a recipe off it in the kitchen (the FT appears in a little window) and cooking. I love sketching on my iPad, and this 10.2 iPad though smaller than iPad Pro 12.9, feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro 12.9 inch is a magazine size (see photos for comparison of 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 with this iPad) and can be heavy to hold with one hand, I need to prop it up while sketching. I find the new iPad even more responsive to the Apple pencil, it's a joy to sketch on these or take quick notes during meetings, that then convert to text if I want. Though I LOVE my iPad Pro this one gets a lot of use due to the size and portability.,I like keeping this one on my recliner arm to browse around when I am next to the TV to find out more about the program I'm watching, or to read a book in bed without worrying about dropping it on my face. The iPad Pro needs to be propped up, and once almost broke my nose when I got sleepy and it fell on my face! I also love looking at my photos that I take on the iPhone on my iPad as it's more immersive and so much easier to show someone than squinting at the phone. I usually keep the photos in iCloud due to the limit on storage on the device, and the iPad can just download them when I am viewing them. I also do craft work, and watching YouTube instruction videos and reading my crochet patterns is great on this size, it's just ready on the side of my sofa. I also drop it countless times (with case on) as it's sitting on the sofa arm, something I worry more about with the iPad Pro as it's bigger. I also like that this is the one device that still has a headphone jack, I own some sets of high end earbuds that use the traditional jack and it's great to be able to use them with it as the bluetooth buds need to be charged and sometimes I just want things to be simpler.,The 12 MP Front Camera on this 2021 version is great as FaceTime is so much clearer than my older version, I had to switch to my phone to FaceTime earlier due to the blurry video, but now I can do it right from the iPad. iOS 15 has all new features like Center Stage where the camera moves with the participant in a call, and that makes it so useful. I typically don't use a keyboard on my 10.2 iPad as I rarely type on it. I prefer doing that on my iPad Pro, but I've tried this size with Belkin and Logitech keyboards and they worked really well. Although I could fold them back, I just didn't like the added weight as I did not use the keyboard often enough and once you put on that keyboard cover the advantages of a light tablet go away.,Overall, I would not really recommend upgrading if you have a recent iPad, but if you want to give your older iPad to a kid or your mom and get this one, go for it. However, I do recommend getting an iPad over other tablets. iOS 15 has unlocked even more features on it and it's super intuitive. It makes me happy to have a device where I can sketch at a moments notice, watch a show, or a craft video, edit my docs, write down my ""bright"" ideas with Apple pencil and have them convert to text, talk to my friends on video and oh yes, also listen to music, although I do that more on my phone. And it's the right size to carry in my purse, and I don't have to panic about dropping it or even losing it. Go ahead, you deserve it.

  How do you milk a sheep? Release a new apple product.,Similar product to the last one. Minor upgrade. Battery dies quickly. No expandable storage. Screen is very reflective and color accuracy is poor. The only thing they did right is go USB-C instead of their awful lightning cord.

Naira,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Let me list down the pros and cons first,Pros:,Versatile,Top-quality webcam,Slim and lightweight,cons:,No USB-C,People I know often ask me what laptop or tablet they should buy and, I say them if your budget is low you should consider the cheapest Apple tablet which is a wonderfully flexible machine that I know will do the job for them and you can relegate it to use as a mere web browser or a Netflix viewer.,Add a keyboard, however, and you have something you can also use for work and email on the move, with a whole world of apps to choose from that turn it from what might look like a fairly basic machine into a device that you can do almost anything with. And the upgrades to the front-facing camera, display and overall performance only serve to strengthen its appeal on this front.

  If you decide to purchase an older version of iPad. Unlike android devices that let you upgrade to the newest operating system. You do not get that option with apple. This limits the apps that are available and the games are limited as well.

   Upgraded from an  IPad 2018 6th Generation to the Ipad 2021 9th Generation. As you can see in the picture the new Ipad is on the left, it is slightly bigger than the 6th gen IPad, and a little heavier.,Have used the 6th gen Ipad every day since I got it back in 2018 as a gift from a friend. And have really really enjoyed using it, never have had any problems with it. When I saw the new 9th gen was coming out I preordered wanting to upgrade, and was going to trade in the old 2018 ($150) but my wife wanted it so gave it to her instead. But she likes this one so much she is thinking of trading it in and getting a 9th gen as well.,This Ipad has 64gigs of storage instead of the 32gigs I was used to. Which is greatly appreciated!. I spend a lot of time on the beach with my Ipad, reading, listening to music, and occasionally watching a program or two. I now have more storage for the music and videos.,Now one of the main reasons I use the IPad is for my meetings for worship with the JW Library app and Zoom. JW Library has no lag. It's wonderful to use on this tablet. And I've used Zoom already a few times since I got this Ipad last week. And I can tell you the front facing camera upgrade is amazing, from the 1mp to 12mp you can notice a huge difference. And how the camera tracks you or you with your partner is a great feature we love!,I don't know what type of rear-facing camera the 6th gen had compared to this one but there is a huge difference. I added a couple pictures I took of a sunset and sunrise on the beach, and a video. I am astonished at the quality and the beauty of the pics with this IPad. I have literally taken dozens of pics already and you can see for yourself the quality.,Have also played around with some of the apps that came preloaded with it on OS 15 such as Imovies. Making a home movie, adding pictures, and effects, and music, is a breeze, the A13 processor has no problems whatsoever handling making the movies.,I downloaded the new show The Lost Symbol to try out this tablet. And I can tell you it is a great viewing experience while winding down at the end of the day before going to bed. I am glad it still has the headphone jack.,The True Tone technology on the screen leaves viewing the pictures taken and watching videos an amazing experience. This is a great technology that really shines through on this tablet.,I am super satisfied with this tablet and highly recommend it for its easy of use, and tons of awesome features and quality for the price. If you're wanting to take awesome pictures or videos, use it for meetings and video conferences, and reading, such as using the JW Library app.,A couple of other features more from the OS than the tablet itself I thought were worth mentioning. Having the Translate app on the home page. My wife is learning English and is always using this to translate messages she gets and sends all day, a great great feature! And the Background Sounds which can be activated and put on the control center through Accessibility and Audio Visual, and Background sounds. My wife turns this on every night to help her get to sleep.,10/10!

  I have a gen6 iPad and wanted to upgrade to the newest ""gen9"" iPad.  As soon as I tried the new gen9 my eyes were strained and soon I had a headache.  This was worse at lower brightness.  This reminded me when using old CRT monitors at less than 60hz!.  Compared the same videos and websites on my current gen6 with gen9 and the gen9 always caused eye strain.,So back it went.  bummer.

  Good iPad; it’s fast, the display looks really good, and it feels like having an iPad Pro.

Denise,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased this to upgrade from my iPad 5th generation.  It was a huge upgrade for me.  It’s fast, stable and has a good battery life.  I love the sound and video quality.  Handles mobile gaming and my heavy use well.  I debated between this device and the iPad Pro 2020 for quite a while.  I felt like I wanted the power and longevity of the new chip, but didn’t need the extra features of the pro.  I do believe that the next pro coming out will have the best of both worlds and have a better display so if it’s in your budget and you don’t mind waiting, I’d get the iPad Pro 2021.  Otherwise the iPad Air 4 is a fantastic device.  Unlike any other tablet I’ve owned, it truly meets my needs.  I literally do everything on my iPad and am on it almost always.,My gripe about this was the storage size options.  The base iPad Air should start at 128 instead of 64gb.  I upgraded because I had serious storage issues with my last device and because I plan on doing image editing and blogging in the future so I wanted the space to work with.  I use this as my main device and will do so for the foreseeable future. If you’re someone who needs more room but are not actively working on multiple or large videos/images, then I’d recommend the 64gb device and to purchase external storage drives.  iCloud too is an option for storage.  And of course picking up a 2018/2020 pro is an option if you need more space and it’s in your budget.,Last point- this was a very expensive purchase for me.  But my base iPad 5th generation impressed me so much with how long it lasted and how well it performed that I didn’t mind making the investment in the new air.  I’d never owned an Apple device before so it’s not a platform I’m loyal to.  I have however owned several android tablets that didn’t work well for me, didn’t last long, or became outdated.  My iPad 5 was from 2017, fully functional and it’s still supported.  It will likely lose support with the next major iOS upgrade likely next year- it has the same chip as the iPhone 6 I believe.  I upgraded because of this, storage issues, and wanting a more powerful modern device.  I expect the iPad Air 4 to be supported and last at least 4 years.

becky b,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Know if you buy an iPad off Amazon, you only have 30 days to return.  Then you must deal with Apple who DOES NOT honor their warranty.  LCD screen on iPad 4 ""broke"" after 2 months.  Apple saying LCD must have been damaged-- and abuse is not covered under warranty.  They want $419 to repair.  I would agree that abuse/damage should not be covered under warranty but this damage defies physics - the screen protector and the glass screen are not damaged, at all.  So just not sure how an LCD screen gets damaged from the inside out??!  Apple said it could be from pressure put on the iPad but nothing like that happened.  Besides the screen protector it was kept in a leather folder as well and never dropped, leaned on, sat on, etc.  In a period of 30 min it went from perfectly fine, to a screen with lines on it.  My advice, get a MS Surface or other tablet that is not Apple.

If you are planning to use the new model of the ""Air"" version to do a lot of reading (particularly if you are holding it up like a book), you'll be disappointed at the weight, bulkiness, and overall feel.

  This is a delayed review. I really think I was scammed. This was supposedly a new iPad. When I opened it it was already charged. It shuts off constantly. Every day it just shuts off numerous times. I get so frustrated. I really wish I had just returned it but with the pandemic it was going to be a hassle. I figure better late than never to warn people. And it doesn’t hold a charge for any length of time. It’s a complete rip-off.

  Alright, I won’t say the Apple Watch is the best watch in the world because I know not everyone will agree with me but gosh is it really useful. Although this stainless steel version is on the pricier side, it sure is durable with the sapphire glass that’s resistant to scratches and the stainless steel chassis case, more durable than the aluminum version at least. If you’re like me and try to take advantage of all the Apple Watch features, it’s a great buy. If you’re someone who uses smart watches more casually such as for time, messages, notifications, etc. then I would reconsider and maybe think about getting a different smart watch unless you’re willing to learn all the features that are available on it.
"
Cynthia Rusak,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Charger didn’t work. Apple needed to back erase the contents from the watch to be able to send me a new charger and it took several conversations with Amazon to get it resolved. Each time was a different answer. One told me they could do nothing unless I wanted to return the entire purchase for a replacement. I was finally offered a credit to be able to purchase a new charger. I would have been better of going to my mobile provider to get the watch and the support that took a week to resolve here.
"
Chuck,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Apple Watch itself is great and as advertised. But I would order from another site. I tried using Amazon's 12 month equal pay option, but they ended up still charging the full amount without notifying me of any changes. Despite using an Amazon card, it took 2 emails, 10 minutes of online chat, and then 20 minutes on the phone to get the billing rectified. Customers shouldn't have to spend an hour of their time to resolve a billing issue on the seller's side, much less when it's the seller's credit card being used. Not the best look for such an established company. The month delay in shipping due to the supply chain issues is understandable, the effort on resolving issues that are in Amazon's control, is not.

  I absolutely hated that this did not come with a charger. Now I am stuck home with Covid for Christmas and I have a useless Apple Watch that I cannot charge. To add insult to injury the correctApple chargers Cost a minimum of $30 and are not available on Amazon for over two weeks. So now I have a Watch that I cannot use and I cannot go out and get a charger. Apple sucks to package their watch in an unusable state. At the very least a small adapter should come in the original package. Gave battery life accuracy and mobile app all bad reviews because they cannot be used without a charge.

  I upgraded from a Series 4 Apple Watch. I like the ""always on"" display and the added blood oxygen measurement. Other than that it doesn't do much of anything that the older watch doesn't do. But IMO it's enough to justify the upgrade.,FWIW, the slightly larger display isn't at all obvious. Is it a little bigger? Yes. But if I wasn't told beforehand I'd never have noticed!

I really enjoy being able to see my updates and texts without having to take my phone out of my pocket, which is very helpful with the group family texts :) It also helps save time when the phone rings as you can see who is calling, again without taking the phone out of the pocket.  I'm still learning how to utilize it to its fullest extent, but I do really like it and I'm so very happy that I splurged for it for myself.

  The watch is almost what I expected.  However, for the money, I expected to receive the ability to charge it.  Shame on Apple for their greed and lack of customer service.  I received this for Christmas and couldn’t use it until the stores were open and I could buy a charger.

  Going from Android to iOS was a little strange, at first, but I’m so glad I did. This watch has been wonderful to wear. It’s stylish look and the health apps has been the most important reason for the switch. I hope to keep this for at least a couple years. That is until they release the much rumored blood glucose monitor in the near future

  Received a defective Watch whose display won’t turn on even after 2hrs of charging it! First Amazon delivers it late. Second it doesn’t turn on. Third the Amazon app does not have a “replacement” option. Only return. How will I get this Watch back on thanksgiving deal that I purchased it on?! Very bad experience with Amazon!

  I upgraded from a second-generation model to this one. I dislike that you have to pay so much more to get one with the Milanese loop band and have to get a cellular model to get the dark color. This basically does nothing more than the ones that are several hundred dollars but are about twice the price. That is the negative. On the positive side, I like the always-on display, the EKG function, and the larger display. I look forward to a time when these become thinner and have longer battery life. I would buy it again.

Sanpete,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support.,This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU ""style"") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.),Amazon doesn't offer most of the options you can get, only the ones listed. For now (and probably later), that's the Pro with 16GB RAM and 512GB or 1TB SSD, or the Max with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 3 versions total.,Screen Brightness* and Happiness,This screen can get up to 1600 nits brightness and can sustain full-screen brightness up to 1000. That's very impressive, as MBPs since 2016 have topped out at 500.,*But the vast majority of the time, this screen will also top out at 500, because those other numbers are only for HDR (high dynamic range, what Apple calls XDR), i.e. some videos and some photos viewed in some programs. If you're browsing the internet, using productivity apps, or the like, those are almost all SDR (standard dynamic range). You'll be seeing them at the same brightness as with MBPs for the last five years.,That said, the new screen is beautiful and bright in both HDR and SDR for most situations. For HDR, it puts out more color and brightness, and darker blacks - a million-to-one contrast ratio - with a wider range of light and color that has more pop and more detail in shadows and highlights. It can be dazzling or just more realistic.,For SDR, it's much like before, still a gorgeous screen, with better contrast than before because of darker blacks.,Has more pixels per inch (254, up from 226), and more pixels all over (3456 by 2234, up from 3072 by 1920). The aspect ratio remains 16:10 (not counting the top menu bar).,ProMotion,ProMotion is Apple's name for screen refresh rates that can go up to 120Hz, or lower to save processor/battery power when 120 isn't needed. This makes motion smoother, more natural.,For now where ProMotion applies is limited. Most scrolling in browsing, including with Safari, still tops out at 60Hz. Which is fine for me, but it bothers some people, looks choppy to them. This could be changed with a software update.,Bloom and Ghosts,Bloom is when a bright spot on a dark background bleeds out past where it's supposed to be, a common issue with this kind of screen. I and most others think this screen handles it well (better than the iPad Pro), but it can still arise some.,Ghosting is when a moving object leaves a noticeable trail of ghost images behind for a fraction of a second, one for each new frame until the old image fades. MBPs are notoriously mediocre at this kind of ghostbusting, and this screen is no exception. Expect the usual haunting, if you notice that kind of thing.,PWM,For those concerned (you mostly know who you are), there is PWM (pulse-width modulation) on the smaller 14"" version of this screen, and so very likely on this one too, at a frequency of 14,880Hz at all brightness levels (measured by NotebookCheck). That's a very high frequency, considered well beyond what would cause trouble for the susceptible.,The Notch,As you can see in the main photo here, there's a black Notch at the top of the screen. There are no pixels there. The long-desired improved camera is there, and a mic array and light sensor (and maybe room for a Face ID system if they decide to make MBPs with that). As with the iPhone Notch, it's controversial.,You can make the Notch disappear, or rather blend in, if you make the background up there black. It also disappears into the black bars when you view things like videos in full-screen mode.,The cursor disappears into the Notch if you put it there. If an app has menu items that stretch there, they disappear too, but they'll still function normally if you put the (invisible) cursor on them.,Desperate times call for desperate measures. Most apps won't have this trouble, but if you must, you can avoid menu items disappearing by using the ""Scale to fit"" function, which shrinks the entire screen work area a little to fit below the Notch. Makes it look like an old 15"" if the background is black, like there are wide black bezels. (Google ""Scale to fit below built-in camera"" for full instructions and mockery.),There are also third-party apps, such as Bartender, to manage how items appear in the menu bar and keep them visible.,Camera and Mics,The new camera that, along with the thinner bezels, makes the Notch necessary, is 1080p, with an f/2 lens for good exposure in the shadows. Video looks noticeably better than before, though it can have a processed look.,The three mics sound very clean and natural but with a little less bass than before to my ears, which is fine.,Extra Screens,You can use two external monitors with the Pro, down from four with previous models. They can be up to 6K @60Hz with a billion colors. The Max can still use four: three 6K and one 4K, all @60Hz etc.,You can use 4K @120/144Hz HDR monitors too.,You can run two from one port if you use the right kind of dock or daisy-chain.,Headphone Oomph,The new headphone jack has more power for high-impedance headphones. It automatically adjusts, so it won't overwhelm low-impedance phones. If the headphones have less than 150 ohms impedance, they get 1.25 volts RMS. If more, 3 volts. That might cause it to fail to provide enough power to some not-so-high-impedance headphones that still require extra power, such as planars.,With my 2016 15"" MBP, I've had to use a portable amp for my Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pros (250 ohm), but now I can pretty well do without it, though sometimes only just. The volume on some sources is still not always what I wish I could make it. But now I can nearly achieve hearing loss with the intro to the guitar riff in ""Money for Nothing."" Which also sounds good, and healthier, a couple notches down.,Among other headphones that have tested favorably with the new jack are the DT 990 Pros (250 ohm), and the Sennheiser HD650, 660S, 6XX, and HD800 (150 to 300 ohm).,One report says the planar Hifiman HE4XXs (35 ohm planar) sound good, but most planars tested are said to need more power. The Audeze LCD-2Cs are reported to sound good enough, though not their best. The LCD-3s and Hifiman Sundaras and Aryas are said to be underpowered.,For my usual regular-impedance phones, Cleer Flow IIs (16 ohm), the wired volume is a little louder than before, though still not always the earsplitting barrage I want for some sources. Maybe for the best.,Quality iems (in-ear monitors) that require especially clean input, but not too much, reportedly sound good, including Andromedas and Moondrop Starfields.,Speakers,They're improved from the already laptop-leading speakers from earlier MBPs, with a fuller sound and decent kick, amazingly good for when nothing with a 3"" woofer is around.,Apple mysteriously says the 14"" M1 has the same speaker system, but looking inside both machines shows the speakers in the 16"" are bigger - both ""subs"" and tweeters - and located differently, with the subs in the front corners on this one. The 16"" has fuller bass (such as it is).,Heat and Noise,There isn't any.,None with my typical use, at least. If you push it hard, it can get warm, but not as hot as my 2016 15"". Which makes sense, as this has a larger enclosure, bigger fans, larger, better heat sinks, and more power-efficient processors. The fans don't have to spin up as much to do the same amount of cooling, so it's noticeably quieter even when it does heat up, rarely makes any noise at all.,The 16"" Max comes with a larger heat sink than the 16"" Pro, so likely runs a little cooler and quieter sometimes, though the Max might get hotter when it uses a lot of that extra power.,Keyboard,Very quiet, much like the older Mac laptop keyboards, not the butterfly ones from 2015-19, but the rest. Maybe less travel in the keys than some of those, but plenty for me.,I miss the touch bar sliders for fine control of some functions, but you can still use sliders via the Control Center, the icon next to the date on the screen's top menu bar. That's also where control of the keyboard backlight is, no more control for it on the keyboard.,Touchpad,The best available by far, responsive and large so you can carry the cursor over a large area with more control. For clicks, it's great. For taps, which I turn off, it's not as great, according to those who prefer that - appears to be a software issue.,Ports,There's one less Thunderbolt/USB-C port than before, but 50% more bandwidth (3 controllers instead of 2).,The HDMI is 2.0, can drive up to 4K HDR @60Hz.,The SD card reader is shallow, so the cards stick out. There might be room for a flush micro-SD adapter. I only have cards up to 64GB, which work fine. Some people have had trouble reading some cards, so it may be finicky.,Battery Life,I usually keep plugged in, but the reviews I've seen that cover battery life tests typically say it's the longest of any similar machine they've tested, including PCs. Reports of battery life for office work, browsing, watching videos, and so on generally range from 10 to 16 hours, sometimes more. It can go unusually long with heavy use too, 5 hours or more of video work, for example. Max Tech did 10 benchmark and stress tests with it in a couple hours, some maxing out the CPU or GPU for up to ten minutes, and it still had 36% left.,At normal settings, there's no performance hit until you get down to 3%; until then you can process or game at full tilt. There's a low-power mode that extends battery life by limiting performance, lowering screen brightness, etc. The Max also has a high-power mode, but it seems to only ramp up the fans sooner to help cooling. Apple's description and tests in reviews indicate it doesn't affect performance in any direct way.,The Max has tended to have a little less battery life than the Pro in reviews. The only good tests I've seen that compared directly either found negligible differences or up to 15% less battery life for the Max. (Other tests haven't been well controlled.),You can quick charge to 50% in a half-hour. The new power brick is 45% more powerful than before, and maybe 30% larger lengthwise, still small for what it does. You can charge at lower speed with smaller bricks (not included) via the USB-C ports.,Size and Weight,It's noticeably heavier than before, about 5 ounces over the previous 16"", and not quite as sleek, but it's sleeker than I was expecting from the photos.,Repairability,Ha ha! But really, it's better than it was. Battery modules now have pull tabs so they can be more easily replaced. The screen can be replaced more easily, but if Apple doesn't do it you lose True Tone (which I don't want anyway). The headphone, Thunderbolt and MagSafe ports can be replaced without replacing the logic board. Now rates a 4/10 from iFixit for repairability, up from 1/10 for the previous model.,Compatibility,Comes with Rosetta 2, which enables M1 Macs to use programs written for Intel Macs, and usually works very well.,There's no more Boot Camp, so to run Windows or Windows programs you have to use third-party software like Parallels, which runs Windows by emulating a Windows machine (and requires a Windows license), or Crossover, which modifies Windows programs to run on Macs.  Which works best, or at all, depends on the program.,Gaming,WoW *mostly* runs 50 to 120fps at high settings and resolution, depending on the location. Some places can't even manage 50 at those settings, though, but do OK at more compromised settings. Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo III, CS:GO and several others can run at 60-100fps or better at good settings.,You can play Windows games via Parallels or Crossover. They generally don't run as well, but some do fine.,Most games, including native ones, run quite a bit better on the Max, with up to 2x the fps. Final Fantasy XIV is hit and miss at good settings even with the Max.,Gaming isn't usually hot or noisy, can get warmer with light fans for the games that aren't running natively. And there's no noticeable performance hit for gaming on battery.,Work,I have to mention the less fun part: how well this does things you might have to do at work. It does almost all of it better than before, much of it way better. Here's how it compares according to actual test results from numerous sources with Xcode, Logic Pro, Lightroom, Blender, Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, and so on. The range of comparison depends on what the task is.,Previous base MBP 16"" (Intel i7 AMD 5300): The Pro is 60% to several times faster.,Previous top-spec'd MBP (i9 5600M): The Pro is about the same to 2 or 3 times faster.,Regular M1 machines (not M1 Pro or Max): The Pro is about the same to several times faster.,The 14"" M1 Pro with same specs: The same, though the 16"" has the bigger battery and heat removal system, so it fares better in those ways.,Windows laptop work stations: This is complicated, but the Pro can thrash most Windows laptops in most intensive work-related apps. It lines up very roughly with machines with a good i7/i9 and an RTX 3070, but generally can't keep up with the RTX 3080. The Pro uses a fraction of the power, and so only produces a fraction of the heat and noise, if any. And lasts and performs much better on battery.,Pro vs Max,The Max is about the same to twice as fast as the Pro, mostly between those extremes. The CPU is much the same, but the GPU is double the cores, so the main advantage is in graphics-heavy work.,Besides the GPU cores, the Max has twice the bandwidth for memory transfer, two hardware video encode engines instead of one, and some extra cooling capacity.,If you're already successfully using a Mac laptop, you don't *need* the Max, since the Pro is already better than what you have. But that doesn't mean you can't benefit from the Max's extra power if you have the money. For intensive video editing, massive photo editing, or better gaming (though cheaper Windows machines will play most games better), the Max has real advantages.,To confuse things a little more, Apple (but not Amazon currently) also offers a demi-Max with a 24-core GPU, halfway between the Pro's 16 and the Max's 32. It's a cheaper way to get the extra bandwidth, video encoder, and cooling advantages of the Max. Tests show that in graphics-intensive tasks it operates roughly midway between the Pro and 32-core Max, often more than half, as expected.,Warranties,This comes with a one-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects that includes free phone support for the first 90 days. If you want to also cover accidental damage (with deductibles) and extend the regular warranty and free tech support to 3 years, you can buy 
,
   (link embedded) or Apple. You get 60 days from purchase to buy it, but coverage for accidents doesn't start until you do. (I always self-insure when I can, so I didn't get it.),Decals,Last and least, this comes with two black Apple decals, the sign of true professional Apple equipment.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Out of the box unusable for me. This MacBook Pro does not have any USB ports to be able to restore from a previous Mac back up that’s on an external drive. You must buy an adapter. Since I live in a remote area I’d have to order online and wait. You cannot even plug a iPhone12 Pro Max directly into it. The only ports it has are thunderbolt. So even Apple’s own lighting connector needs an adapter. The keyboard is a downgrade from the old keyboard. Solid black plastic instead of plastic keys surrounded by aluminum which were easier to see. Had to call Apple support to download an update because there is no reset option in the System Preferences of OS Monterey. And the update did not work to give it that option. Will have to figure out a different option to remove my account and information to return it. This particular MacBook is defective I believe.

  I ordered the 2021 16 inch right away as I knew they would probably sell out fast. I had to make sure I had one for my trip I am leaving on soon.  As soon as I opened it the screen would never come on.  Thought maybe it needed charging so I tried that.  Still nothing but a black screen.  It kept making the sound when you open it up even when it was closed over and over again.  I took it to the local Apple Store hoping I could get some answers.  They tired to get it to work and could not either.  They said it is very strange and maybe something happened to it during shipping.  They said since it is brand new it would be best to get my money back from Amazon.  I thought maybe I could just exchange it before my trip but the one I ordered is out of stock.  I will try the 14 inch and see if I like it compared to the size of the 16 inch since it is in stock.  This is a first MacBook Pro I have ever purchased and now I am a bit nervous.

  Here are the temperature results for the new cool MacBooks compared to the old overheating intel ones. 91 degrees for the old one near the processor, and 74 degrees on the new ones. Both had been running for hours transferring files nonstop. Amazing. I have been editing video, transferring large files and not once have the fans kicked on. Makes me want to cry.

  I have been using my MacBook Pro from 2014 for work until last week when I finally purchased this MacBook Pro. My old MacBook starts up and works as fast as the day I bought it. The only reason I bought a new MacBook was because the battery life was getting low. I probably could have just bought a new battery and it would have been fine.,That being said, I did hold out for this MacBook because Apple brought back the ports that I needed. I use the HDMI and SD ports daily. An Ethernet port would have been nice but that’s asking too much. This MacBook has a 2 day battery life and is blazing fast. I use Adobe programs and this MacBook doesn’t even blink when I do live editing. Best laptop I have ever used.,I own a business that uses many PC laptops and a couple MacBooks. A PC will never last as long as a MacBook. And, a PC ALWAYS gets slower after 6 months of use. The price is high but you can buy a new PC every 2 years or a MacBook every 7 years.
"
Aaron F.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Coming from a 2019 16in, I feel that this generation is 2 steps forwards, 1 step back.,Pros:,-Fans are never audible even under full extended load!  This was my #1 issue with my 2019 mac which would have constant fan noise with 2 monitors.,-2x battery life,-Better screen especially in dark environment or a dark subject,-Extremely fast for certain workloads such as video editing and code compilation.,-magsafe is back (although I personally don't care for it),-most apps work normally with rosetta emulation, but may have some stutter.,Cons:,-thicker and SIGNIFICANTLY heavier.,-Screen has a notch which is very distracting for me.,-Still has some compatibility issues.,-Terrible for games.  Only a few titles are supported natively.  I only tested league of legends(uses rosetta emulator), but it was choppy and 1/3 the fps of my 2019 intel macbook.,- +$300 base price even though they got rid of intel.,-The area I feel apple has made a major misstep is with ports.  I couldn't care less for SD card or HDMI, but everyone who buys this is going to need USB-A.  It's ridiculous that I still have to bring a dongle everywhere just to use my mouse but these ports I never/rarely use are back.,Also some developer related tools/libraries aren't working.,C# debugger is totally unsupported for example.  Anything that requires gpu hardware acceleration (pytorch) is unlikely to ever be supported in any usable form.  Linux dual boot is unsupported or in early experimental stages.  I also had issues building/running java projects natively, but no issues with rosetta.,If you're looking to buy this for an undergrad program, it's probably workable.  However, I'd suggest saving some $ and getting a used mac or windows machine.  Professional devs will be aware of their specific requirements, but I suspect many will need to keep a secondary x86 machine for the foreseeable future.

KP,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  New to the Apple watch and am very satisfied with switching over from Fitbit. Love the screen response, always on feature, and the size/weight. The water proof feature, heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 monitoring are great features as well. I was also concerned about the battery life but am surprised not only how long it has been lasting, but also how quickly it charges. My only complaints (coming from a former Fitbit user) are that the work out tracking detection is about 20-30 seconds delayed, the sleep tracking is not as detailed as Fitbit (if that matters to you), and the App could offer a few more customization options. Overall, very satisfied and would definitely purchase again.

  My 14yr old got his first iPhone for Christmas. I wanted to get him an older Apple Watch (I had the series 4 & was just going to get him that) but they are still so expensive! Spent two days looking online and couldn’t justify it. Came across this one on Amazon and noticed the green one was 338 bucks; sixty bucks cheaper than all the other ones. So I snatched it up for myself and gave my son my series 4 with this green band on it. So far I’m not really noticing much of a difference, and I can’t seem to get the same watch face complication that I had before; that bums me out. The battery life seems to be a slight improvement from my series 4, but there’s still no way to wear it all day and track your sleep too. I charge it overnight. I’m still not sure it was with the upgrade at this point, but I love all the functionality of it. I get Ring doorbell notifications pushed to my watch, Life360, and I love being able to answer calls without pulling out my phone. I’ll be an Apple Watch wearer for life (this my third one).

  I had the Apple Watch series 6 and hated how short the battery would work. This one’s battery lasts way longer, a lot quicker to charge, item was as described, amazing resolution, I love everything about this watch honestly. Super simple to install and start using, I believe it took me 30 mins tops! I love how it is way more accurate on my sleep, heart rate, and all my movements and stats. My issue with series 6 is it wasn’t accurate as well, and wouldn’t track my sleep no matter how much troubleshooting I did. This one I have my sleep tracked on here, and way better application overall. I highly recommend this watch for people wanting something to have that does so much more than other watches and has a iPhone so they are connected all day long. I’m so happy to get this for Christmas and will never look back! ☺️💜

  I’ve owned an Apple Watch since the 2. I had the 4 and loved it. The 7 is equally as great and is faster, bigger, with always on and blood oxygen detection. The stainless steel feels more substantial and looks better but the aluminum is great too. I haven’t owned a titanium or ceramic version. All my bands work with this bigger size.
"
Joe Pohlot,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Watch is fine overall, does all as expected. The band, however broke the second time I took it off (see picture). Highly recommend buying at least 1-2 more bands when you purchase the watch to avoid the down time. The cheaper bands appear to be higher quality than the one it comes with.
"

  I bought this primarily to call for help in case I fall. I have not tried this feature.,UPDATE: I accidentally call 911 while putting on a stainless steel band. The response was immediate, was able to talk on the watch, I explained what happened, operator ask my telephone provider I assume to to verify I was lucid. PERFECT.,At first blush this seems to be a nice device full of nice features.,The documentation is non existent, you will spend hours researching. There is no connectivity to an iPad only an iPhone. While it does come with a magnetic charging cable, there is no charging brick and the cable end does not plug into a lightning port which means you will have to buy a charger specifically for this device.,Once you figure out the different nuances you will probably like the watch.

Cameron Hetzler,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Kind of expected from Apple. The screen is okay but compared to my Samsung Tab S7+, it seems washed out. It may seem nice if you've never had a Super AMOLED display. It's good at every basic task you need but that also means the average user does not need this. There's also way too many points of security checks, where I have to pull out my MacBook just to access simple things on the iPad. It's heavy but somewhat small so it's not quite as portable as you'd expect. I returned it and will stick to my tab. This iPad is kind of like Ronnie Coleman in its strength, but it's ""limited to 50 pound dumbbells"" if that helps any. It's overhyped and it's only differentiated from past models solely by its benchmark scores - user experience is the same, if not worse due to weight and screen quality.

  I had an iPad Air 2 for seven years and loved it. Wrote several books using it with a keyboard case - literally turned it into a tiny computer so that I could write from anywhere the inspiration hit! Then I decided I wanted to try to go back to my roots as an artist and work myself back to where I would be able to illustrate my second children's book. LSS, after wrestling with the decision and happening into some extra funds, I bit the bullet and upgraded. Omigosh, I love this thing! It's been the best investment I've ever made for the future of my creative self.,Do yourself a favor - indulge your creative side and upgrade. You won't be disappointed!

  Had high expectation from this Ipad Pro. I Then decided to return it. The device looks awesome but it's not always about the outside but the inside that matters most. I was unable to transfer files to an App call Magisto, error unsported issue trasfering files from Sd Card to tablet, feels very limited (locked up) compared to Android. Been an Android user all my life. Apple system Is not for me. Don't think ill ever buy an apple product besides Macbook. This exception is the only one I have. Go Android and the more things your able to do. Also, this Ipad takes forever to Charge. Huge Disappointment.

  As expected of Apple, another fabulous product. To me this size is perfect as it allows for portability and single hand use, while still being able to experience a polished experienced iPad OS and Apps. M1 is definitely the right step towards the future, multitasking is improved in iPadOS 15, the screen is a joy to use. Everything comes together with the use of Apple Pencil. Battery, if I had to nit pick is the only thing I would have liked to improve. Will recommend for anyone who wants to have an on the go computer for day to day / non developer tasks, couple it with a bluetooth keyboard and you are good to go.

  I had an original iPad Pro 9.7. It was great but the charging port finally wore out. This one is GREAT. It’s faster, no buttons on the screen,  just touch screen now. About the same size as the old one one but has more screen area visible. 10+ on this one to Apple.

  Since the normal iPad was out of stock I went with the pro when I needed to replace in a short timeframe.  I will probably never use all the capabilities that makes the pro more expensive than the general iPad that is really my only reason for dropping a star due to the price.  But….. if as I expect the pro model is made a bit better and outlasts my last iPad without a problem I will be glad I bought it.  Only got 2 years before my iPad 10.2 failed.  That’s unacceptable.

  I am a grandma who uses my iPad for a little bit of everything. I play games, shop. I don’t really do much work with it. So I ordered one very similar to my old one. I don’t need all the fancy things from the higher priced ones. This one suits me just fine. It was so easy to switch from my old one to my new one. I didn’t even need to ask for help!

  I am on about my 4th iPad and each one just gets better and better.  I am not sure why some people are giving it 3 star reviews.  This is the lowest priced iPad model you can buy and it now has a processor that really makes gaming and other things much faster.,What is better than last years model (8th Gen),This 9th Gen iPad now has a 12MP Front Facing Ultra Wide camera with 2x zoom and the new ""Center Stage"" feature. This is great for video calls as it tracks your movement and keeps you in the center of the frame. Now compared to the 1.2MP Camera on last years version!,The 9th Gen also has a faster processor running the neural processor system. I guess we will learn more about what that can do as more apps come out.,You can now get double the  memory for the same price as last year.  If you don't mess with a lot of photos then the 64GB version should be good for you.  I tend to create a lot of videos and photos so I opted for the 256GB version.,The things that remain the same are the battery life and the screen resolution and quality.  I am still glad they kept the finger print reader and the lightning port.  I got a lot of stuff that is made for that lightning port.,Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  The price is good and I know that Apple products are solid and reliable.

  I had a very old iPad (3rd gen) that was super slow and didn’t even get updates from Apple anymore. Half the apps you want wouldn’t work on it so I decided to update to this new model. The price point is great and it works as intended. Very responsive to touch and it has been great to use with the Apple Arcade games. The battery life is also amazing. I can watch entire football games streaming and the battery is still above 60%.

  I was extremely disappointed on receiving the iPad, it was very frustrating trying to figure out how to setup the iPad with extraordinarily little written directions. The writing was so small you need a magnifying glass to read it. Having to go online to try and find a user manual or information on how to use the iPad left a lot to be desired. I am seriously thinking about returning the iPad if I continue to find it difficult on finding instructions
"
Agustin Mateo Ottaviano,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This ipad is incredible. I bought it together with the 1st generation apple pencil with the idea of replacing all my paper notebooks and taking notes at college with it and I would say that the experience has been flawless. Its not the best ipad available, I know that the Ipad air is sexier, has a bigger screen and supports the 2nd generation pencil but this ipad is just extraordinary for any student. Besides, my experience with the 1st apple pencil is incredible, there is practically no delay while writing, the screen size is excellent for taking notes and the palm rejection technology allows me to take notes fastly. The only downside is that there is a gap between the glass and the screen and you can see it while writing but its not a real issue, you get used to it. To conclude, if money is not a problem for you and you are a student willing to replace all your paper notebooks I recommend you to get the ipad air + 2nd generation combo but if you dont have 700$ to get it you wont regret buying the iPad 9th and not getting the better one.

  I got this iPad for my daughters 12th bday which isn’t until Jan 25th but it was on sale so I pounced on it. Just received it today. Opened it to see if it works and everything does. Everything is new as if I bought it at an Apple store. I read a lot of reviews complaining about the software not updating to the latest iOS version. Well I just updated the software and it indeed did update to the latest version as of this review (01-07-2022) which is iOS 15.2. Overall I think it’s perfect for my 12yo. Though there’s soo many different iPad’s, version this, pro this, ones with the home buttons and ones without. I can’t keep up with all of it but this one will be fine for her. I’m very pleased with my purchase.

  So, the battery life isn’t as good as I would have liked it to be. It lasts about 10 hours, same as my 6th gen. However, the screen quality, the sound system, and the graphics and speed makes up for it. Honestly, I didn’t need to buy this. I decided to after considering it for months. I needed more storage space than the 32gb my 6th gen came with. The fact that it came with a trial for Apple Arcade and Apple TV + was an added bonus. I forgot to add AppleCare+ to my purchase, but that was easily remedied. Once I logged into my new iPad it asked if I wished to purchase a subscription. I got one for 3.99/mo until cancelled. If you do decide to buy one of these, then please get the Apple Care +. I have it for my phone and now for this iPad and it’s so worth it. Some more cons, and this is entirely just because I find it aesthetically pleasing, is that you cannot add widgets to your Home Screen as you can on your phone. Not a major downfall, but still saddening. The keyboard is quick responsive and there is no lag between the onscreen keyboard and your typing movements. It doesn’t have the battery performance settings like the iPhone XR does where it tells you where your battery life is currently optimized to. (My phone is at 91%, I wish I could check the iPad but I’m sure there’s an app for that) I will later on use this for school and will add the Apple Pencil and possibly the magic keyboard as well.,All in all I give this a 3.8/5,Will update as I explore more,Oh, also, the blue doesn’t look as blue as I thought it would. It looks more silver than blue. I wish I had purchased the green, but oh well. That affects nothing performance wise. But if you’re wanting it based on color know that the blue isn’t as vibrant as expected.

  I upgraded from a iPad mini 4. I was thinking of waiting till the iPad mini 6 and so glad I got the iPad Air 4 with 256gb memory instead. The bigger size. It’s a little lighter. it’s just awesome. BTW, I got the green. That’s about the only hard decision I had once I decided to go iPad Air. I did add a basic wireless Bluetooth keyboard and basic mouse not the magic keyboard for the cost and I don’t use them much. I have ordered the 2gen pencil but it’s back ordered so I can’t comment on that. Go iPad Air, you will not regret it.

Aidan Hunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  TLDR: This is the best choice for someone new to the iPad line or wanting to upgrade from an old model. It supports the same, second-gen Apple Pencil as the top of the line iPad Pro, while a unique combination of Touch ID and slim bezels by moving the fingerprint sensor to the top button. And, its got a USB-C port and Wi-Fi 6 for easier connectivity.,Let's take a look at where the Air sits in comparison to the rest of the iPad line--in other words, why pay more to get the Air instead of the basic iPad? As a quick recap, Apple's current line of iPads is divided into four different categories: iPad Mini, iPad, iPad Air (this product), and iPad Pro.,The iPad and iPad mini feature the traditional, circular home button with Touch ID sensor inside (similar to a blown-up version of the iPhone 7/8/SE), and they have fairly large bezels (this is especially bad on the size-conscious Mini). These models have older generation CPUs and only support the first-generation Apple Pencil. This version of the Pencil has an easy-to-lose cap covering a Lightning port for charging it (which requires an adapter, or awkwardly plugging into into the bottom of your iPad). It's completely cylindrical and will easily roll of a desk. These cheaper models also don't support the Magic Keyboard, which allows your iPad to ""levitate"" above the keys; they only support a simpler Smart Keyboard where the keys and iPad screen come together at the hinge.,With the Air, you get the same Magic Keyboard as is available for the Pro--and the same second generation Apple Pencil, which supports double-tap (ex to change pencil to eraser tool) and magnetically mounts and charges on the side of your iPad, rather than awkwardly sticking out the bottom.,By upgrading to the Air (this model), you get a slightly larger screen (10.9"" vs 10.2"", thanks to the smaller bezels). And, the screen improves in quality as well as size. The Air has a fully laminated display, which means there's no air gap between the screen and the glass--preventing reflections and the hollow sound when you tap on the screen. The downside is that breaking the front glass is a more expensive repair--that's why the school-friendly base model iPad doesn't include this feature. The Air also includes True Tone and wide color, which makes the display look more vibrant by adapting to the lighting conditions around you.,You also get much better connectivity with the Air. You'll get the future-proof WiFi 6, which is just starting to hit the market, and a USB-C port that gives you more charging flexibility and lets you plug in hard drives, SSDs, SD cards, cameras, and monitors with an inexpensive USB-C hub instead of the pricey Lightning to Camera adapter required on older models. For those who haven't used iPad in a while, the latest iPadOS actually supports plugging in an external drive and browsing the files on it without any extra software, and that's a lot easier to do on the Air. If you have a Mac, Surface, or other recent computer, you're already familiar with what USB-C can do.,Last but certainly not least, the iPad Air has the same A14 chip found in the latest iPhone 12 and 12 Pro lines. The basic iPad has the two and a half year old A12 chip instead. And, the base iPad has an atrocious 1.2MP front camera, which is hardly appropriate for today's Zoom-centric world.,What are some reasons you might want to get the Pro instead of Air? Both look a lot alike they have the ultra-slim, black bezels (similar to a blown up iPhone X or later, minus the notch). But the iPad Pro also has an enormous 12.9"" option, which comes with Apple's best in class Super Retina XDR display technology--easily the best display on any tablet out there. This is only on the 12.9""--so yet another reason to stick with the Air if you want the 11"" size--and it is similar to the display of the iPhone 12 or Apple's infamously expensive Pro Display XDR monitor. Unlike the iPhone, both sizes of the Pro come with a 120Hz display (refresh rate automatically switches from 24, 60, and 120 Hz based on the content you are viewing), which Apple calls ProMotion.,Speaking of the 12.9"", my one complaint with the Air and the 11"" Pro is that they don't make very good use of the much larger screen space for the keyboard. They allow you to swipe down on the oversized letter keys to enter numbers, whereas the Pro actually displays a separate number row above the letter keys, like a real keyboard. That said, if this bugs you too, you may as well just get a Magic Keyboard or Bluetooth keyboard and use that.,Both sizes of the Pro also have a better camera--a 12MP wide and 10MP ultra wide lens plus flash, similar to an iPhone 12. The Air, on the other hand, has the 12MP wide camera but no flash. Hardly anyone takes serious pictures on an iPad--but if you do, I recommend checking out the Halide pro camera app which was just redesigned for iPad last week. The front camera is also improved (12MP with ultra wide view on the Pro, and 7MP on the Air). The Pros also have USB4/Thunderbolt support for ultra-fast external SSD support, and they have the same M1 processor used on Macs. You can configure them with up to 2TB internal storage, vs only 256GB on the Air. I've never bought a cellular iPad (preferring to use the personal hotspot feature on my iPhone instead), but if you are looking at one, the Pro might make more sense because it comes with 5G support, similar to the iPhone 12.,In conclusion, for most people this iPad Air offers everything you need in a future-proof package and great price point. For those who want it all, get the iPad Pro 12.9"" (think twice about the 11"" Pro since you're paying a premium price and missing the best-in class display of the 12.9"").

  My eight-year-old granddaughter has been bothering me for about a year to get this for her. I was really skeptical. She loves it. I am so glad I made this purchase. The only regret I have is I wish I had upgraded it to have the data. She is loving having the editing programs. She makes pictures and videos. I bought her the pencil separately. The picture is so clear. The battery has a long life I highly recommend it. Do yourself a favor and get a car charger too.

  Or, at least, a laptop go away until I can afford a better laptop-er.,So far, this is not that. For one thing, the expensive keyboard case has amazing keys, but in a tiny little format that isn't really easy to type on quickly, if you are used to using all of both of your hands. The action is way better than my laptop's, but it's cramped.,Having a trackpad is lovely. It was what I had been waiting for before upgrading from my gen1 iPad Air. But the case again interferes with functionality because you can't really adjust the iPad angle. The iPad itself is sleek and gorgeous. And it's a lot faster than my old iPad. And it has a lot more space in it. And - in theory - it should run app versions of everything I use my laptop for.,In theory.,And it almost does.,Kind of.,But it's a pain and a half to set up. Its security features won't let it transfer passwords from my other devices, which means that all of those passwords I let Apple suggest for me (before I learned the hard way that Apple doesn't always save them after setting them) - I have to enter by hand on the iPad. Mind you, I got the iPad's settings from a backup of a different iPad that had all those passwords already. Anyway, I can't even think of getting rid of my laptop, because I need it to look up my passwords so that I can enter them on the iPad.,(Yes, I know it's supposed to be as easy at turning on the keychain. It's not, though.),Bottom lines? Yes, it's pretty and fast. No, it's not worth the money, and I wouldn't buy it again (I would either get a mini to do phone games and quick emails or shell out for the big iPad Pro and be done with laptops forever once I got my passwords in that one). Yes, I'm keeping it and am open to changing my mind.

Matt B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Purchased iPad Air 4 on behalf of my mother in law  using my prime and the purchase went fine.  She was in need of a new tablet to replace the original iPad Air, and 8 year old IMac, as most of their computing and banking is done from the iPad now.  I use the iPad Pro 2020, and had I known about the Air 4 becoming released, I would have just gone with this model as I didn't need the extra memory or processing (although I am going to need video editing for a home issue I'm have to deal with now, so thankfully I already have one).  The IPad Air 4 will be plenty useful for most people who want and expect their tablet to last for 5 years without showing any significant signs slowing down or fringing on obsolescence.  In terms of shipping, Amazon needs to do something extra about their use of FedEx and USPS shipping services...this $600 device was just left inside my oversized mailbox.  I haven't had to deal with a stolen package yet, but all I know is I'm not paying for an item if it's stolen after being dropped off in that manner.
"
Seth M,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like mine, and it honestly makes me wonder why I would get a Pro anyway. The iPad Air continues to assure me that—just like the smartwatch market—Apple is plain dominating the tablet space.,Let’s start with design. I’m mostly happy with it; the screen is great (despite no OLED tech) and USB-C is amazing in its versatility. The Touch ID integration for the lock button is forever awkward though. The camera bump is also an unusual thing we have to live with these days. Apple’s omission of a 128GB model seems a very intentional “in your face” move, but at least I have more space than I need with the 256GB model.,The user experience is pretty fantastic. I’m still getting used to the swipe-up “home” gesture, and it seems like I’m always hitting controls in the app when I try to use it—accidentally flipping piano keys while trying to leave GarageBand, for example. I think the files app could use further refinement too. It seems sluggish when copying files from an external drive, often crashing when I copy files before even getting the opportunity to paste them in the iPad storage. I’m also rather annoyed that Apple keeps Photos storage segmented from Files. Why am I not able to access things that make perfect sense to access? That’s what a files app is intended to do. All in all though, really big fan of how they have everything laid out, and I’m glad iPadOS gets specific usability features to make things more intuitive.,It finally comes down to performance. This thing shreds whatever I throw at it. My use case is fairly niche: apart from the usual mobile computing, I was hoping to have a capable mobile machine for light video editing via LumaFusion. I’m delighted to say that—apart from some stability issues with copying clips from SD cards in Files and some export instability with LumaFusion (the app’s fault, not Apple’s)—this sucker destroys light to moderate video editing with H264 and even some H265 video. And if it can do that, it probably does anything else you can reasonably imagine throwing at an iPad. All while featuring stellar battery life that doesn’t have me lugging around a giant power brick because I’m afraid of overstaying my welcome at a meeting or coffee shop (if you can find one that’s still open for seating). That’s pretty cool. I’d say that with the 2020 iPad Air, Apple is 90% there with the whole “iPad is a computer” thing, and I’m glad it continues to move in that direction. It’s impressed the heck out of me so far.

  I got mine a few days ago and I'll confess I find it a lot of work to get it set up.  I was starting to wonder if I would be able to do the things I had planned...  Then I got up yesterday morning and my iPad wanted my password before I could use Touch ID.  I entered it carefully several times and it isn't accepted so now I'm waiting for a cable from Amazon to connect to my PC and reset the device with my iTunes account.,HOWEVER- I have spent almost two days without it now and I lost track of how many times I wanted to do something with the iPad.  So I miss it very much already- a good sign!,When the cable comes I'll try the reset and make sure I'm better prepared for this next time.,Also- you'll need some BlueTooth headphones.  No old-school jacks here- just ""USB-C"" (and we're like WTF- LOL!),WHEW!!!  If you are up for a bit of a project, this might be one to consider.

  I purchased this laptop because my previous laptop (a behemoth of a gaming laptop) broke suddenly broke down. It was great, except for the fact that it felt a little slow. Maybe it is because I had downgraded from a 144hz screen to a 60hz screen, or maybe because my previous laptop was a performance monster, it just didn't feel that good. However, other than that, it is an amazing laptop. Very portable, and doesn't really heat up that much. Also, it charges super fast, therefore I could charge it for 30 min to 1 hour in the morning and go the the whole day without having to worry about charging it. Overall, it is an amazing product, however, it wasn't the one for me.

  The Apple MacBook Pro looks great and, based on all the reviews, it probably is.  However, as a 71 year old man, accustomed to using Windows for the past 12 years, this new MacBook Pro was very different.  The part of it that really makes me angry is the fact that it came with NO INSTRUCTIONS.  I need something to look at and do things, step by step.  It started off with a Voice tutorial thing that was as confusing and ridiculous as anything I've ever seen.  Trying to access the ""guide"" on my cell phone while trying to set up this MacBook was as frustrating as anything I've ever attempted.  For a big company, like Apple, to fail so miserably at KEEPING IT SIMPLE, is a horrible error.  I will struggle through this but I'm not happy about how difficult this is for me.  Some clearly written instructions, included with the machine, would have been nice.

  I purchased this for my 4yo daughter's online classes so it definitely did not disappoint. She uses Zoom an Google Classroom and these programs work flawlessly on a MBP M1. We do not plan on doing heavy tasks on this laptop, just the basic browsing, social media, video calls and online school stuff. It's pretty fast, but I find that our 2014 16"" MBP retina to be the same. The battery lasts FOR DAAAAAYYYYSSSSS. A full charge lasted 4 days w/ 3 hours of daily use. Quite impressed! I know how sturdy MBP's are with our 2013 and 2014 MBP's still alive and working well, so I know I'll get our money's worth with this laptop.,TLDR: Lightweight, battery for days, super fast, apps and programs work seamlessly for students.

  I purchased this laptop and it dropped, but not a hard drop and the screen broke. We had to replace it and did so with an original screen. It got hit again, not hard (I swear!) and it broke again. I've never had a laptop that's as fragile as this one.

  A nice, lightweight computer with beautiful screen and nice sounding audio speakers. Battery life is awesome.,Only negatives are:,1. I miss the mag charge connector, this USB-C seems flimsy and  not durable.,2. ZERO ports! You'll need a side port product like the Cheotech or others if you want to add accessories.

  The Touch Bar on this Mac book makes writing so much easier. It has predictive text and know what you’re trying to say. It saves passwords by your fingerprint. If you are an Apple person like me you can unlock your max book from your Apple Watch. The battery life on this is amazing. I’m on it hours at a time and hardly ever have to charge it. Great Apple product.,Keeps my life on track as I’m a busy teacher and parent and travel for my other job!

  It is now September. This Mac works about as well as the one I bought 10 years ago. It now has a major issue with the battery not charging. No Macbook should have this type of issue in it's first year. My last one had zero issues for 6 years. This is just a poor company selling second-rate products. Steer clear.

  Bought the green series 7. You can barely tell that it’s green if you change the strap. You have to know it’s green or be looking for it in the right light. Could easily pass for a black or dark charcoal. The image quality is great for such a small screen. The swipe keyboard is useable, but voice to text still reigns supreme for convenience. Not sure I would have upgraded from an older version like the SE or 6. Very glad to get the 7 since coming from a Fitbit.

  I really wanted one of these watches since all of my clients had them and loved them. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and the whole reason I mainly bought it- fitness tracking is constantly inaccurate. Anytime I do a work out with my peloton 50% or more of the data is missing. I’ve tried to troubleshoot the app several times as recommended by removing and redownloading and reconfiguring and nothing works. Also when I go to record a walk outside it just stops abruptly after about two minutes every single time. Doesn’t matter if my wrist is up down to the side it just does not register the work out. I wish I would’ve saved this box I would’ve completely returned it. Super disappointed.

nancy mandell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The actual watch is good so far aside from not including a charger adapter and having a bit of a learning curve to set up and learn the features, but the pricing on Amazon keeps fluctuating and they will not guarantee the pricing. Even if it changes within a day or two (or sometimes within hours) they'd rather you return the product and likely they will lose money having you ship it back and then having to resell it as used and then have you re-order rather than just reimburse you a few bucks. Kind of takes the excitement out of it. I'll probably just keep mine to avoid the hassle, but beware if the pricing is important to you. Took an exciting experience and just made me sad I bought it.,Watch came half charged and died by the time I went to bed, but will see how it goes fully charged.,If this is your first Apple Watch you'll probably need to look up a few tutorials, it's somewhat intuitive, but not completely.,Just wish I bought it elsewhere.

Vanessa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Fast set up, had to upgrade my phone but that was no problem. Took about 40 minutes, bought the USB C charger after reading the reviews but luckily my iMac at work had the connection so I charged it on that until I received the charger. With Verizon I connected the cellular in about 10 minutes through the app. $30 activation fee and $10 a month. The watch is in great condition, I also ordered a case to keep it protected. I’m really happy with my order! I also Afterpay’d this and I’m onto my 2nd payment. 5 star experience fast shipping and battery life last long when you turn off the “always on” option. I upgraded from a series 3 and so far I’m really happy with my purchase

  I mainly wanted to use this as a tracker for runs and swimming.  It tracks runs or walks fine but no better than my fit bit charger 2.  I really wanted to use it for swimming laps.  I have used it twice.  Set it for 25 yard lap. I have a manual way that I count my laps which I continued to use. I did 46 laps the Watch showed 38.  This would also make all the other data, heart rate etc less valuable.  Very very disappointing. If swimming is important part of why you wanted this watch right now I would say do not buy it.  It does not work well at all
"
Istvan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Totally worth it at the 380 discounted price. My last apple watch was a Series 0, -- the first one -- and now we have a bigger screen, great battery life and a bunch of new sensors (EKG, Oxigen, Heartbeat) that make it a non-brainer to buy.,Don't get me wrong, I still sport an Omega Speedmaster or a Brietling for high-stakes meetings, however I use the apple watch as my daily driver for everything else.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like it. I've wanted one for years and bit the bullet. Works well for tracking workout activity, receiving notifications/messages, changing/selecting music without needing to pull out my phone. Battery lasts around a day and a half. You should plan on having to charge it every day, I would say.,Problem: You literally cannot charge your watch out of the box if you do not have a usbc charging block. I own no devices that utilize this. I had to shell out more money after spending $350 on this watch. This is unacceptable. I would understand if there was no charging block for a normal usb plug in, everyone has one laying around.

  First of all, Thanks Amazon for very fast shipping even I am not a prime member. This is my second Apple Watch, my first Apple Watch was first Apple Watch came out,it's still working fine and love it, but it's time to upgrade, Apple Watch series 7 is so NOT EXPENSIVE, it has all most every necessary application that you want to have in a watch. It's easy to set up. If you like to wear a watch, then Apple Watch series 7 is a must have.

Jazzy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve previously owned an Apple Watch (series 1). A lot has changed since then. The set up took me hours. I had to update my iPhone to the lasted iOS. Okay. Then the actual pairing the Watch to my iPhone was time consuming. It keep telling me it wouldn’t pair. It took me quite a while to get it to eventually pair. Now once it “paired” it was once again needing a Watch app update to fully connect.,Another downside. No charging block included. So it costs me another $20 to get a charging block as my iPhone 11 Pro Max was still utilizing the traditional USB to Lightening charging cable and block when I bought it in 2019.,Battery life. Much lower than my previous Apple Watch and even my Fitbit. Chargers fast but definitely needs charging every 24-36 hours. Which makes it hard to utilize the sleep tracking option.,Once I got passed all this, I have really enjoyed the Watch. Next time I hope the process goes more smoothly. I don’t remember back in 2015/2016 it taking this long or difficult to set up. And if I remember correctly I also got a charging block AND cable.,**Please excuse any typos

"
Stpete28,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I just upgraded from a S3, and to be honest I have a hard time finding the improvements. The screen, because of the rolled edges and the way text kind of rolls off the side, looks strange and gives the impression your using a 3rd party app that wasn’t designed for your system. But you’re not, it’s Apple. The ECG system is honestly the only reason I bought the watch and love that feature. If you don’t need the ECG, stay with the SE or S6 as that one does not utilize the rolled edges.
"
Jerome Yyy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Kinda small compare to 44mm,The main issue is it limit too much:,I can’t change or design the watch face freely, or those simple design need some third party app.,The notification also too limited, when I using  my phone, I can not get vibrate from the watch anymore, that lead a problem is,1. when turn on “do not disturb”, all silenced like no watch;,2. when I planned get notification from watch shake and accidentally open my phone, loud noise from my phone come out - due to some app’s bad design I can’t use silence mode if I want to hear something.,??????????????,I know Apple like to make decisions for customers, but not this one.,Maybe blame bad app developers who silence their app when phone at silence mode &when there is a positive media volume.
"
Kathy L. Cluggish,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the feature of the screen staying on without wrist movement. Watch charges fast and the battery life is better than the older Series 3 I had. I previously had the 42mm and debated on the 41mm vs the 45mm. Went with the 41mm because I have small wrists and it's hard to get bands to fit. I do not miss the 1mm difference from my old watch. There is increased screen size on the Series 7 which makes up for the size difference. I also love the new features. Definitely a winner.
"
Gentleman Jim,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch has been an interesting investment.  I bought it for several reasons.  I liked the ECG function since I do have a genetic heart valve problem.  The ability to get my heart rate by locking into the gym's treadmill is a great feature.  The one feature that I wanted that the watch does not have is sleep monitoring.  I wanted to know how long I actually slept and how deeply.  The watch either does not have that feature or I have not found it yet.  Not using that feature does allow me to charge the watch overnight.  And, what the heck is it with Apple that they sell you an overpriced watch and then are too cheap to supply a charger.  Get real!

Biff Raines,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a great Apple watch. The only issue I have is that Apple does not supply with the watch a charging unit. It supplies the charger cable (USB-2) but no base charger. SO YOU WILL NEED TO BUY ONE WHEN YOU PURCHSE AN APPLE SERIES 7 WATCH.

SolarSystemCitizen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple's previous EarPods and AirPods have all fit me perfectly, but the Gen 3 AirPods are for MUCH bigger ears. For me they just fall out, I have played around constantly and it is impossible to get them to stay. Other times it seems like they are doing fine, and one just spontaneously drops. for that reason I would never wear these out and about. Also, the new click button to pause, instead of tapping, seems like a big downgrade to me. the midrange sound is better than previous generations, but that is worthless if they don't stay in. They are also designed to not have a perfect seal, so they let in a TON of background noise. Probably part of the reason they have less of a grip, too, I would guess. Pretty darn disappointed in these for being so limited in who they can fit well.
"
Sunray,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  UPDATE:  After working out at the gym, noticed they do tend to shift a bit in your ear so you have to make sure they are secure in your ears.  Dropping 1 star from perfect 5 to 4 out 5.  Still a fan due to improved audio quality & highly recommend.,Have been a fan of the 2nd Gen Airpods with the sound quality & comfort level wearing them to the gym, running, and falling asleep with them in bed.,Took advantage of Black Friday sale - 13% discount and so glad I did.,1. Definitely noticed the added bass & improved sound quality without having to upgrade to bulky earbuds or headphones.,2. Generation 3 has a very snug comfortable fit.,3. The discount was an added bonus, even if they were not on sale, I would be a satisfied customer paying,full retail with the audio performance.,Highly recommend it for the comfort level and those who enjoy additional bass & bump with their music.
"
Sean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Upgraded from prior version and these sound significantly better than last pair.  The use of spatial audio / Atmos with these is a game changer if you listen to lots of music (I use Apple Music).  There are always better solutions, but for a pair of ear plugs worn in the office during the day, they don't block sound (which is good for me hearing phone), but the overall sound quality is amazing.  I would say it is on par from going to 1985 cable TV to 4K Blu-ray.  Stuff you have heard before but with these if done with Atmos are really amazing.  Surprised these have really good bass, and not thumpy or muffled bass but clear bass on songs.  You can discern the bass notes,One  con, that I don't personally have an issue with, but many may, is these are little bigger than past version and my wife feels they are too large for her ears.  I read somewhere about rotating them a bit so they are not pointing down and and more forward does seem to help and may not be intuitive to many.  I would recommend finding someone that has a pair and trying on if you think size is a concern.,I recommend Let It Be by Beatles remixed album in Atmos.  One, its a better mix and not over produced, but more to point is how clear it is and you feel like you are in the studio with the band with these.

h. williams,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This review is for the carelessness at the hands of Amazon. I bought a prepared pair that’s still registered to the previous owner’s Apple ID. I’m able to connect it to my phone and use it. However, because it’s still connected to the owner’s ID I run into three issues:,1. If lost or misplaced I won’t be able to find them bc it isn’t registered to my ID,2. If I have any technical issues with it, I won’t be able to get any help with it from Apple or qualify for a warranty replacement because again, it’s registered to someone else’s Apple ID,3. The previous owner can see my location at all times and that’s freaking weird! They can literally use find my device to track me smh.,Amazon should be requiring customers to remove the device from their Apple IDs before accepting the return. This makes this item useless to anyone bc you don’t have true ownership for it. I’m fortunate to have realized this within days of purchasing the item so I can still return it and get my money back. But, I feel for the people that purchased a used/refurbished item and won’t recognize this as an issue until it’s lost or not working. At that point it’ll likely be months out of the return window and money down the drain.,Im posting this review in hopes that others will see it and remember to check the previous ownership before keeping it.

  Beware if you have small to normal sized ears, these 3rd generation AirPods will most likely tend to fall out.  The sound quality is excellent, as long as they could stay in my ears.  I'll try the generation 2 AirPods instead.  The design shape of the generation 2 AirPods is more like the wired Apple AirBuds and that particular 1st design is perfect for my ears.  This was a big fail unfortunately, due to the design shape causing these high quality bluetooth ear buds to periodically fall out.  It would be nice if these were made using the generation 2 AirPod shape.  It's a shame too, since the audio quality has somewhat improved from the generation 2 AirPods.  I really wanted to keep these.
"
Andy Vandiver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I almost did not buy these given the complaints others have had about the shape vs. ear fit.,1) I ordered from Amazon -- here within 48 hours,2) They paired instantly with my iphone Xr and came with 78% charge,3) Put them in my ears and they fit perfect.  Of course, everyone is different, but I had *no* problem with fit,3) I hit play on itunes and the music sounds terrific.,4) A little later the song lowers its volume to have Siri inform me i have a calendar appointment coming up.  This is pure bliss for me for work to keep my on track for my many calendar based calls while listening to focus music.,Great product for me.
"
DoughDecahedron,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality was exceptional!,Problem 1 - However, in order to use the Spatial sound I had to disable the auto ear detection feature.,Problem 2 - unlike previous airpods, instead of lightly tapping to skip or pause the sound, you have to awkwardly pinch the R airpod, once twice, or three times to perform this function.,Problem 3 - the Right airpod would not charge, right out of the box, sealed and brand new, verified legit Apple Airpods via the serial number.,Problem 4 - there was a firmware update, and despite several attempts to get it to auto update, was unable to get the airpods to update.,Problem 5 - the design is not as good as its previous design. The case is wider and the airpods are short and klunky and the bud is wider and is uncomfortable for smaller earholes.,I really wanted to like them. Untimately, I returned them due to the charging issue.

  I have never been impressed with bluetooth headsets for phone calls.  I purchased these primarily for talking, not music.  In comparison to the wired headsets that came with my iPhones they sounded less natural for me and my caller.  My background noise was amplified with the Airpods where it was annoying for people to talk to me if I was making any noise whatsoever.  I tested this several times with Apple technical reps and friends by standing at my kitchen sink and turning the water on and off.  They could barely if at all hear the water on the wired but with these it was very loud.  The last Apple rep could not even hear the water on the wired and then said OH YEAH.....that's loud!!  I also got a weird effect intermittently from one or both Airpods during a call.  It was like a whoosh or special effect sound similar to a surround sound simulator.  It was totally random.  Some callers said my voice would drop intermittently as well.  I did a full reboot/reset with no change.  I was using with an iPhone 11.  They advised to update firmware but their instructions did not work and I was unable to update.  I considered trying another set but gave up.  I will stick with my wires...they work every single time and sound perfect for phone calls.

  Apple AirPods (3rd Gen) is an expensive pair of true wireless earphones, given that there's no active noise cancellation. However, in all other ways, this is a good pair of earphones. It works very well with Apple devices and accessories, sounds good, and offers an all-round usage experience that is tailored around iOS, Siri, and Apple Music. Although naturally not quite as good as the AirPods Pro, this is the next best option.

  I was in the market to replace an older IPad mini with 128G. The new mini comes with 64G and jumps to 256G, which I do not need. The price dif between the 256G mini and the IPad  Pro 128G was only $100 so I said why not. A little getting used to the size dif going to the 11"" pro but am pleased with my purchase. Battery life seems to be better than the mini and it is a lot easier on the eyes when reading. Also impressed with the stereo sound and quality of videos. I'm not one to update my devices when something new comes along so this will satisfy me for some time.

  The iPad Pro with the M1 chip is the fastest and nicest tablet that you can buy in my opinion - there were some issues with the Haptic Touch (think my iPad was a little faulty as some places made a weird noise when touching), but overall you cannot complain about this tablet. In order to get the full value of the tablet I would have to recommend that you are either a student or do a lot of heavy design work - otherwise just get a cheaper android one!

  All I can see is the ugly black notch when using this thing. What is otherwise a great laptop is ruined by this completely stupid decision to cut out a large chunk of the screen. Doesn’t even have Face ID so why?? It actually makes it seem like a smaller screen than my old 13”. It cuts off the top menu bar, it is so bizarre to use. The keyboard isn’t the best either. It’s pretty thick and chunky kind of like they went back to old design. Lose the dumb notch and it would be good.

  Ok. So for the average user, like myself, this may not feel like a huge improvement but this is a MAJOR upgrade from my 2013 MacBook Pro. I hated the idea of theist gen MacBook with the touchbar. It was cool, but as far as I knew it was not the game changer apple wanted. I like the actual keys and I need my ports. I’m kind of angry that Apple took away the features people love and then charge them more when they give them back, but I guess since I needed an upgrade it’s okay.

  I ended up ordering two 14"" macbook pro's with AppleCare+ for my teenagers, and they don't want to use them.  Yes, the display looks nice and sound is really premium.  Even the magsafe power adapter is quite good (magnet is strong, and the link feels solid).  But these 2021 pro's are really bulky and much heavier than expected.,My kids have been using Surface 2 laptops for the past 2.5 years, and they prefer those over the new macbook pro's.  Surface laptops themselves have minor quality issues (both power adapters died after a year), but they are lighter, slim, and do all the kids' school tasks with ease.  I am just hoping they will change their mind and get accustomed to their new macbooks before the new year.,For those wanting to buy Macbook Pro 14"", please visit the Apple Store and check them out first.  I feel they are more suitable for corporate employees, teachers, and technology-driven adults - all with strong arms.  For teenagers, Macbook Air will likely be a better option.  I was going for Air with some huge marked down prices up to last week, but seeing most only come with 8GB of ram - and ones with 16GB demanding over $1,500, I switched to Macbook Pro.  A big mistake.

  Switching from android to this thing is a major learning curve. No back button, audio level is backwards from android, screen freezes requiring hard restart. You’ll wear out your finger swiping the screen. Would not buy again. My wife has a 5 yr. old version so I thought she could help but this version is nothing like hers.

  Despite Apple nitpicking over the bevel of their screens and adding a few extra GIGs of storage space every year or so, they continue to fail to address their inferior SOFTWARE problems.,Apple, like all the big tech monopolies, want your DATA, so they design their pathetic software to do just that.,You buy the iPad, but that is all you own.  You don't get to use the APPS on your iPad because Apple is greedy, so they want MORE.  So they force you to set up a stupid Apple ID (which they use to track you and sell all your life data) and only then can you use the apps that you ALREADY PAID FOR!,Back before the times of corporate surveillance and mass data collection, a person would buy an object and that would be it. Nowadays, you have to give up your life to the corporations in ADDITION to buying their products.,I'm SICK of companies collecting everyones data, and I will NEVER use Apple again if I can help it. If you want a tablet for drawing, buy a Wacom or other brand!!!

  The backlight on my Ipad was defective - sketchy that I have never had such an issue with any apple product other than the single one I purchased on amazon. Would not recommend buying from a 3rd party. Ended up spending almost 2 hours of my week in apple to get a new product. I was lucky they had the exact one in stock, or they would have had to order it which would have made me even more mad. Just go to apple - they are the retailers for a reason.

  I had to give this purchase 2 stars as an “average” of all the “qualities”.  I had to round it down because there’s no way to give half stars.,Anyways, I am extremely disappointed in this iPad Air.  I even purchased the magic keyboard and new 2nd gen pencil!  The battery charge on this thing, to be blunt, SUCKS.  The battery steadily loses charge even while the screen is of and its in stand by mode.  It acts like an aged, used battery.  My Pro I have is a few years old and was used heavily and just recently started quick battery drains.  It’s very frustrating because this stuff aint cheap!  And I expect Apple to be way better!

  Pros:,Charges fast with nice battery life (some apps use a lot more battery than others, as per usual). Screen is crisp and large (needed for my aging eyes). Fingerprint scan was tedious to get started but useful once you've got it running.,The rose gold is nice, leaning more towards either pink or gold depending on lighting and perspective.,Obviously it has plenty of memory, and takes decent photos.,Lack of home button adds to screen size. An on-screen home button is available and can easily be moved around on the screen so it's not in the way.,Cons:,I don't know if it's the iPad or the iOS, but only thing that really irks me is that the battery percentage doesn't show on the lock screen and there is no way to enable it that I've found. I wish the iCloud came with more memory than 5G before you have to pay for it, and easier ways to download photos and videos from iCloud would make me much happier.,Uses a USB-C to USB-C cord, and like many adapters it's somewhat bulky. I generally plug mine into a surge protector with charging ports, so I did have to buy new ones that also include a USB-C charging port (eh I wanted new ones anyway). Connects to your computer the same way, so depending on your model you may need a different cord or adapter to connect if you go that route.,Lack of home button is a PITA for me, but if you go into Setting>Accessibility (I think that's where I found it) there is a way to place a home button on the screen and program it for the app switcher.

  I love it and I say that as someone who wasn’t an apple fan. It took some getting used to as I’m an android guy. But once I learned the interface it’s ok. Moving files isn’t as nice as android but it’s ok once you’re used to it. The Apple Pencil 2 works awesome and doesn’t really lag or look displaced when drawing. I switched chrome out for safari and if you want to add a home screen button that opens a webpage in chrome then use thier shortcut program. That one took me a bit to figure out.

  I've used computers since 1969, as a programmer and a consumer. At home I've gone through about ten different computers over the years, starting with the original IBM PC which I bought in 1983. This is the first Apple product I've ever bought.,Aside from a few quirks, the iPad Air 4 is the ideal household computer. It's extremely compact, has a supremely powerful and fast processor, a nice camera, excellent WiFi 6, and a breathtakingly beautiful video processor/monitor. It comes with no keyboard, case or prop. I suppose it's just supposed to sit in your lap as sold.,Luckily I've found several different mounting clamps, ergonomic Bluetooth keyboards, Bluetooth mice, a case/keyboard and a hub I can plug into its single USB-C port. It's the only port you need, handling everything from power to video to extra memory easily and all at once if you plug a hub into it. I have one iPad Air 4 that I move between several locations around my home, each with a large ergonomic Bluetooth keyboard and mouse at ideal typing level and the mount for the iPad at eye level on a desk shelf. I can type away comfortably for hours -- or watch a movie as I snack. With the hub, I can use a wired Ethernet network -- much faster than WiFi and more reliable. I expect it to last several years, so I use a screen protector and case. I've cracked one screen protector already with no damage to my iPad.,Now for the quirks. The hub I bought has an HDMI port for an external monitor. Unfortunately, you can't change the aspect ratio of the picture, so you end up with an image narrower than that of most monitors. You better have a monitor with sound, as using the HDMI port cuts off the iPad Air's otherwise nice speakers. This machine runs iPadOS, a version of IOS. It doesn't have as many features, making it harder to run productivity software -- my principle use for my iPad. MicroSoft Office's iPad version is hobbled as a result. So, my older Windows tablet must fill the gap sometimes. It takes the dongle to use wired headphones. I have some nice Bluetooth headphones, but I miss the super high fidelity of my wired cans if I can't use the hub. Video calls with Apple FaceTime and Google Duo are glorious on that screen, but if you don't have it rotated to portrait mode, the selfie camera ends up on the left edge. However, I quickly got used to that.,I'd recommend it.

Jason A.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I usually don't write reviews on tech items like this, but I was really disappointed with the screen quality compared to my old standard iPad.  I decided to upgrade because my old 4th gen iPad was just so slow.  All the reviews seemed pretty stellar for this model in terms of hardware so I decided to pick it up.  On the speed front it is amazing; loads documents, web pages and apps very quickly.  No performance issues.,The screen quality on the other hand is terrible in my opinion.  Not sure if this is standard or if mine was just defective, but the viewing angle is noticeably worse than my old iPad.  Even rotating it a few degrees while reading in bed changed the colors on a white background to pink and darkened the edges.  This remained unchanged even when adjusting the automatic color correction.  This led me to look up issues with the screen on this model, which also showed that there was significant backlight bleeding in one corner.  Further, when comparing the screen to my old iPad there is much more reflection on the iPad Air.  All this combined resulted in an annoying game of adjusting my wrist to maintain the exact right angle so that it didn't distract me while reading a news article or .pdf.,I'll make one more observation in my albeit limited time with this product.  The battery also seems to drain faster while doing the same activities I would normally do on my old iPad.  It came out of the box at 96% and after less than 8h of intermittent use (surfing, checking e-mail, reading news article and documents) it had dropped 25%.  I can't make a direct comparison to my old iPad, but it feels like that was a considerably faster rate of battery usage.,In the end, the increased performance simply could not make up for the poor screen quality.  I guess I'll have to wait until the pandemic is over and I can actually utilize the next gen ones in a store before purchasing.

Tracy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this thing. It is lightweight and fast. Battery life is amazing unless you are watching a ton of videos which is the only time I have to charge it in the middle of the day. I paired it with the Magic Keyboard and it has replaced my MacBook Pro but I am not a power-user. I have the pencil as well which is nice but not as useful as the keyboard for my uses. The screen quality is also terrific, very clear and bright. If you require an iPad for more intensive tasks consider the iPad Pro but for most casual users this has plenty of power and speed. I mostly watch videos, browse the web, edit some photos, email, and work on the occasional document or spreadsheet. My MacBook Pro doesn’t have a touchscreen and I get to use apps for banking and other things which I feel is more intuitive than using the web in most cases so this is my go-to “computer/laptop” now.

Tony Wang,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I choose this ipad mostly because of the screen size, I think that 11 inch is the best size for a ipad. The second reason I choose this ipad is the storage, my used ipad has only 32 G and this brand new one has 256 G. And 32G is not enough for me any moreI bought this ipad  for my daily study , and the screen if the ipad air was so clear, the speed is very fast, better than then version 2. very light, the battery last long. nice product. The camera was so clear, bought for myself as a gift I have used it for more than one week, and till now everything works so well. would like to recommend it to all my friends.  I love my purchase, and this new iPad Air was indeed a nice step up from the iPad 7th gen. I highly recommend this new iPad Air!! I choose the color green because summer is coming, it was a nice feel to watch videos with a ipad with color green. The best gift that I have ever had.

Football Nani,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love everything about this watch! It charges quickly and the battery life is good. Like other rechargeable devices the more you do with it the faster it goes down. Since it charges so quickly that’s no big deal. I didn’t like the band because it’s too sweaty in in the summer. I think I should have gotten the one with cellular because this one has to be near my phone to do some things. Another piece of advice I have for others is to get an adapter when you get your watch so you can charge it. I couldn’t set mine up until the adapter came.

Four stars because even though it was at a sale price, it’s still in my opinion over priced by $50-$75.

Podes contestar llamadas con buena comunicación en doble vía y además te permite usar muchos shorcuts que te hacen tu día a día mas amigable.

Florida Stanley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First time Apple Watch user and still learning the ropes and abilities of the watch. I don’t know why it would take some people forever to set their watch up as it personally took me less than 30 minutes. As long as you have ios15, it shouldn’t take you that long. So just make sure your phone is running the latest software version before doing watch set up.,Keep in mind, you MUST order a separate charging block as they do not include one for you but this should not prevent you from setting up the watch. My watch came 70% charged so I was able to do everything I needed to set up.,I got the Starlight 41mm delivered yesterday and it is beautiful. I’m still playing around with the watch but it’s fun. I’ve used the ECG and Blood Oxygen apps and those were neat. I’ve never had an AW before so I can’t compre the battery life to previous modes but it’s definitely holding it’s charge very well.

  The watch arrived with a. dead battery. After a three hour charge using a USB-C charger which I had also purchased, the watch remained charged for less than 15 minutes. It is charging now overnight but surely a brand new watch battery is supposed to be a little charged then recharge easily. After 4 days, It now recharges fine. The ECG app is extremely poor and Blood Oxgen is very slow compared to pulse oximeter. I bought for these features. Apple does say not for “medical “ purposes. I am not a fitness freak. I am learning to use features that require purchase of additional software that helps me. Pay attention to your purposes for buying this watch. I hated it but have learned to use certain additional software to my benefit and am having no more battery problems so I am now pleased.

  After spending $800 for this thing, I had to spend another $20 to get a USB-C charger cube. I must have 20 USB-A cubes, but this is not compatible. Of all the zillion devices I have, none need a USB-C female charging outlet. I understand why USB-C is needed, but not to include a charger cube?,With the battery arriving DOA, I had to charge it from my laptop which was not very convenient since my laptop USB-C port is used for several other purposes.,They must have saved $2. Oh ... add it right to the bottom line.,There are also no instructions included whatsoever.,What a bad first impression.,Setup took over two hours with required updates, downloads, authorizations, pairings, log-ins, etc. I suppose a lengthy setup is understandable ... but did I mention no charger and no instructions? I'm not likely to get over that. Really ... how cheap can you get Apple?,It is interesting to note that I got a 31 page printed manual along with my Apple branded USB-C charger cube I had to order, but absolutely nothing along with my watch!!,How cheap can you get Apple? How cheap can you get?,It's an amazing device, but products that don't present themselves well when opening the box are doomed to failure in the market. I am both upset with and shocked at Apple for this.,3 stars is all you get. All the incredible engineering that went into this was lost on me immediately by the decisions made by some idiot product/marketing manager.,I am soooo done with Apple products.

  Let me start by saying I'm not an audiophile. I mostly into pop rock and I got a Apple TV 4K this past Christmas for spatial audio enabled movies and shows like Dune, Matrix Resurrections, Foundation, etc.,Spatial audio was the primary reason I upgraded and was skeptical they would be better sounding than the Airpods 2. The first song sold me on the AirPods 3, the audio was just that good compared to AirPods 2 and even rivaled AirPods Max. They are well worth the money. The one down side is the fit. The AirPods 2 fit me perfect, I've had some instances of the AirPods 3 falling out of my ear. The plastic shell feels more slippery and doesn't have as secure fit for me. If I get animated like running or something with action body movement theres a good chance one or both are going to fall out. I'll knock 1 star for that, but it may fit you fine. I kept them as I'm mostly working from home now and their primary use will be watching movies on the Apple TV. When I'm out I use the AirPods 2. Maybe someone will come up with a thin silicone sleeve to increase the grip.
"
JMA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My second gen Airpods were giving me issues so I figured I’d get these while they were on sale. Yes they fit a little less secure than my old ones but they still stay in place. They only *feel* like they will come out. It’s the first thing you’ll have to adjust to. The sound is noticeably better with substantial bass and midrange. No question the drivers have been updated and they just sound richer than before. But you can take that better sound to the next level by turning on spatial audio. Best way to describe it is when you’re connected and listening from your macbook, it will seem like the sound is coming FROM the macbook but in full high fidelity. Turn your head and you’ll hear *where* your macbook is from the sound. When I first turned spatial audio on I thought the airpods weren’t working. You can also have spatial audio just locked in without the location effect.,With the additional battery life, and wireless Magsafe charging, this is a great upgrade from the last one. Really happy with these.

  I've been putting off the AirPods because I have had plenty of classic Bluetooth headsets around the house (Plantronics, Jabra, BlueAnt, etc).  They've all worked pretty well, and they all lasted numerous years, and they've all been pretty inexpensive.,After more Zoom meetings and aging batteries, I finally went to the AirPods, and I sure am glad I did.,First, set up is stupidly easy.  I mean it is ridiculous.  The Bluetooth consortium can definitely learn from Apple.,Second, the charging case is fantastic.  None of my other headsets have had a charging case, and I'll let you that I had no idea what I was missing in terms.  Related, and third, the FindMy capability. My classic headsets were always somewhere dumb, but with FindMy I am 1000x more likely to find them and use them.,Finally, the sound quality is infinitely better than all the rest combined. I've had at least 6 bluetooth headsets over the past few years, and they are lousy garbage compared to the AirPods.
"
IZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The first AirPods I’m keeping. The previous version is not that impressive and the Pros I don’t like. I have used Bose ear buds for many years and find them unmatched in sound quality, however, they are big, stick out (try wearing a headband or hat with that) and have connectivity and volume control issues. For earbuds that expensive, it’s not acceptable. And why I gave these a try.,Sound quality wise, I like these ones best of all the AirPods. Spatial audio is absolutely amazing. Their stem is smaller than the first gen, which is nice, and they have no noise cancelling. I consider that an advantage, but it really depends on individual use. I run and need to hear my surroundings. Turning off noise cancelling on the Pros turns on their mics and every sound gets amplified, including hair swishing back and forth or a hat covering them and moving ever so slightly, it drives me nuts. For people who do not need noise cancelling, this is much better. And cheaper too.,I also like the fit better, I’ve never liked and used ear buds with tips that need to be inserted in the ear canal. However, they don’t stay put and that’s their one major drawback. They need some kind of tips to secure them in the ear and Apple should provide those. But since they don’t, you should consider getting them yourself. The selection is currently not that great and reviews not that many, but I found some that work. I had a great run without losing any and they fit so lightly that I don’t feel them at all. Which is all around amazing and may make the my favorite ear buds yet.

Steven Sun,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Here are a few points that I think would help potential buyers.,1. The case sits slightly taller and feel a hair bulkier than previous gen,2. Battery is better. The airpods last noticeably longer without needing to go back to case. But I feel the number of charges the case hold also drops by maybe 1 or 2 counts. Combining the 2 factors, I believe the total battery life still lasts longer than last gen. The reason for the case charge count drop could be because the airpods can hold longer charge now.,3. spatial audio does feel great, and it's amazing that it could be implemented into this small device.,4. mic performance still great, it is better than the mic on my sony xm4.,5. This is the most important bullet point I want to mention. This generation has qc issue for sure, my first order went back due to connectivity issue on the left airpod. My second order was returned due to static noise on the right airpod. The third order is great so far. So if you're looking to buy this gen. I highly suggest buying from vendor like Amazon who has great return/exchange policy. By comparison, my 2nd gen airpods didn't have any of issues mentioned above. If you search online, it seems the static noise issue is quite common lately.

  I’ll start with the pros and cons and then give an overall at the end, this review is just my opinion on these AirPods, if it helps you, great!,Pros:,- I did in fact receive legitimate AirPods, I confirmed it through the warranty under the settings, I know this was a concern for some people,- They sound a lot better than gen 2 with more bass and more clarity and they get just as loud if not louder, the spatial audio is cool but not life changing IMO,-The battery life gets me through a day at work where as my gen 2 did not, they also charge very fast,-These actually fit me a little bit better than gen 2, I guess I got lucky with my ear size, I know this is an issue for some people,- They stayed in my ear during my work out sessions,-I personally prefer the pinch controls over the tap/touch controls due it being more comfortable for my ears,Cons:,- Overtime as the inside of my hears get moist the left side tends to get loose for me,Overall:,I’d give this product a 4 out of 5 stars, If they used a different material that prevented them from being slippery in my ear during long use i would given these AirPods 5/5 stars

  Even though the shape of these is very different, it feels very much like AirPods 2.  This is a good thing.  And Spacial Audio is cool but very few apps support it, and the auto spacial audio is kind of awkward.  The new ""pinch"" is honestly a downgrade over AirPods 2.  It's much less convenient to pinch than the tap especially if you're out running, wearing gloves, etc.,The ""Find My"" support is extremely basic.  It sort of finds the charging case using a system similar to AirTags, but not quite as good.  This only works if your AirPods are actually in the case.  If your AirPods are out of the case, you're SOL.  You're better off buying one of those leather cases and supergluing a Tile or AirTag to it.,Basically if you're happy with your AirPods 2, don't buy these.  Unless you subscribe to Apple Music and really love Spacial Audio.  The music quality otherwise is honestly about the same.

  Faster connection when you put them on. (Feels more immediate compared to the first gen AirPods) Sound quality is about similar to the first gen. Earfit is also not much different at least for me. Imo, wired EarPods still yield superior sound quality due to, well, the nature of being wired. Regardless, I’d upgrade/buy only because of a better battery life for wireless earpiece experience for Apple devices.
"
Michael,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these and was very excited as these would be my first pair of airpods.  The classic earpods (with the wire) always fit great in my ear.  They were comfortable and never fell out, but I wanted a wireless pair.  I bought these, knowing the shape was slightly different, but figured it wouldn't make a huge difference...boy was I wrong.,The new shape is very uncomfortable.  As a result of the discomfort, I adjust them a lot to try to find a more comfortable position.  They fall out too (probably a result of adjusting them and the poor fit) - I haven't worn them for a workout yet, but I am not optimistic they would stay in place during a run or other intense workout.  Very disappointed.  Also slightly disappointed by the battery life.,Edit: 2 stars because the sound quality and battery life has been impressive thus far
"
Brian,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These don’t fit as well as the 1st and 2nd gen AirPods. The bud is bigger and doesn’t stay in as well, they’re also slightly heavier feeling. My AirPods 2s disappear when I put them in, forget I’m wearing them. That’s great because I wear them all day at work.,On the positive side, the sound is better, can go much louder and slightly better depth. I’ve never had a problem with volume on previous models, just noticed these go very loud to the point you could hurt your ears maxing out the volume.,Comes down to what is more important to you, comfort and fit or sound quality. For me personally the comfort is most important so I’ll be keeping my 2nd gen AirPods.,PS- I tried my friends 3rd gen AirPods and cancelled my order. Don’t worry, I didn’t wear these and return. Not sharing ear wax :-)

Vicky McGregor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My son had already ordered one. I loved his. He uses his for work so he got the full data and WiFi as well as the apple pen. I don’t use mine for work so was very pleased with mine with no data. Just WiFi and less data storage. Easy to set up. And have used it since opening the package. My old one is 9 years old and still doing great, however, it was not accepting updates on some of the apps I use.

  I have had an iPad Air for many years, but it was getting slower due to less storage space.  I ordered this one from Amazon because I could rely on them to ship it quickly.  I am very pleased with the battery life and the touchscreen and the screen quality is great.  Now when I travel I can be better in touch with my rental business.
"
Bruce Gardner ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had this iPad 11 inch pro for about a week and works great. Very quick on WiFi . The touch screen is great. Some apps are a little different on a iPad vs iPhone  but works fine. I would recommend this product.
"
H. Saunders,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The lack of a home button and Touch ID was unsustainably inconvenient. Face ID didn't work at all. The gesture that replaced the home button was buggy and worked less than half the time. So, for all the beauty of the display and the speed of the processor, if I can't easily navigate and must use my passcode instead of a biometric ID, it just isn't worth it.
"
Linda Bracken,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Hookup was magic since I still had my old one.  It transferred everything from my old one to this new one.  I thought it was going to be a suicidal mission but I couldn’t believe how easy it was.  But I don’t know how to use the camera and other features and there is just a small sheet of paper with a couple of basic diagrams.
"
Andy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Was great in the beginning!! But after 2nd week the battery life was dying quickly. I am sure its a glitch.  reached out to customer service they wanted me to go through troubleshooting and I did 2 more weeks when by and I still have to jump through hoops to get my return approved when the return deadline is 01/31/2022.  NOW I HAVE TO PAY to SHIP it back.  NOT very good customer service

  I really like the new iPad. It's my first one ever so I can't compare it to previous versions, but this one with M1 is so cool, fast with a fabulous display and perfect colors.,And Amazon is probably the best place to buy from. The price is really good and the offer is better than many other resellers and even better than Apple itself.

  The seller had nothing to do with this issue, but FedEx did a poor job with the shipping. They left the IPad unattended, out on the communal blacktop parking lot. The battery life seems to be on the short side.,Other than that, we love the iPad.
"
Cour,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I would not recommend this. Battery drains very quickly and camera quality is poor. My 3 years old iPad works better than this one . My first Apple product which I think is waste of money.
"
Luke Bennett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is beyond what I expected. After never owning an ipad in my life to getting this one as a first, I’m amazed! The reviews for this thing were off the charts. For it only being $329 you really get a powerhouse of a machine for the price tag. It can handle multi-tasking very very easily. The battery seems to never drain as well. The brightness of the screen is perfect for just chilling around the house which is what I’m using it for. Grabbed a nice tempered glass screen protector and a case with a prop-up on the back of it and it does the job. The only thing I wish they did differently was get rid of the notches at the top and bottom of the screen. For $329 I can’t complain too much! You’ll be happy with this device especially if it’s your first ever ipad.
"
LisaM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I do agree with most of the reviews about this iPad. I wish the screen was a full screen tho.,Besides that I do see a definite improvement from the older generation iPads.,I purchased a keyboard to add more of a “laptop” feel.,If you  don’t use this iPad for a lot I  think the 64gb  will do just fine.,I do feel the speed is  faster with this 2021. I maybe a  little biased because I  only  purchase Apple products so I really have nothing to compare it to.,Overall if  you purchase you will not be disappointed in this one for the price.
"
B. Sands,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  For the price, I finally bought a tablet for drawing. I thought I might also be able to do some handwriting, and while the write-to-text scribble feature is pretty cool, it is not going to work for writing like, an essay or novel. Too much finicky reactiveness, perhaps with my specific handwriting.,I was worried maybe I'd find it too small for drawing, but again for the price and having put off a drawing tablet for some time I really really am enjoying it. Plus it came a whole month earlier than anticipated!,I can't actually speak to the camera quality. But for battery life it did come at 70% and I used it for five hours straight to 20% so not seeing any issue there.
"
G,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is certainly an upgrade from my old iPad Air (1st).  It works well. Responds rapidly. Screen sharpness is amazing. The reason I'm giving it only 4 stars is that it frequently hangs up on YouTube...I thought at first it was YouTube but my iPhone 11 works fine on that.  It also is a bit finicky in connecting/staying connected to my Bluetooth hearing aids.
"
Francisco,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I didn't notice it at first, but when I turned on dark mode, I immediately noticed that my iPad has a dead/stuck red pixel (see pictures). With the brightness turned up, it becomes even more noticeable. I tried the various videos on YouTube, that is supposed to fix the issue, but none of them worked. So make sure to check your iPad, to ensure that you don't have the same issue. I'm going to return this, because I don't want to do a warranty claim and get a refurbished iPad, when I just paid full retail for a new one!
"
Chris Istre,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When trying to set up the iPad we were unable to. We got in contact with Apple and was informed the product was actually refurbished and locked to a corporate company. Due to this the iPad could not be used at all. 10 out of 10 do NOT recommend…
"
D1,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m a bit disappointed because I couldn’t Bluetooth all the information from the old iPad to the new iPad. I would need current software, on the old iPad to make that happen.,Well duh! If my old iPad could update to the current software, then I wouldn’t have replaced it.,I guess I’ll try to use iTunes on my PC, to pull everything off the old iPad, and transfer to the new iPad.

  Me ha gustado  mucho hasta ahora. Todo funciona como debe, muy fluida y bastante util practicamente para todo lo que necesito. Lo complemente con un teclado inalambrico Bluetooth y sin querer me doy cuenta que acabo de sustituir mu laptop que uso desde 2016.,Unico pequeño detalle es que aun no hay app de whatsapp (aunque uso la version web, pero no se puede apreciar la camara en videollamadas ni otras funciones de la app oficial). Ni app de calculadora oficiales pero...,Overall esta excelente. Ademas de que la adquiri en oferta y me ahorre uf casi un 25% o 30% de lo que costaria adquirirla en mi pais R.D
"
Sarah Bourch,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had this iPad for 2 days now. At first glance of the package it was completely full in contact and dno damage delt.,Pros: - extremely smooth for games,-great value and excellent video quality,-amazing battery life (up to 10 hours),-compatible with controller and keyboard,Cons: -Sometimes, the screen will freeze for about 1-2 seconds,-audio is not really good,-if you turn it to high brightness, it will drain batter 1.8x faster,In Conclusion, this is amazing for about anything you want to do such as Ebooks, Google search, games, or anything else. I am happy with my purchase.
"
Darrell Wong,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I didn't want to buy an Amazon Fire tablet so the next cheapest thing was an Apple Ipad.  Several things I don't like about the Ipad.  It constantly askes for your fingerprint or passcode every time you attempt to download an app.  If you don't have other Apple products, you have to set up your Apple account, two more passwords, one for your tablet, one for your Apple account and since it's not powered by Android which uses Google to store passwords, you need to locate your saved passwords from Google and retype them.  I also don't like the interface.  I have to learn everything all over again.  It's a hassle.  I'll stick with Android next time.  Also I had to buy a separate charger that had a USB connection because I needed to reset the Ipad to factory settings when I forgot what my passcode was after not using the Ipad for a month.

  I finally gave up my 10 yr old MacBook and bought this 2020 Mac Book. Sooooo much easier to carry- light, easy keyboard, EXCELLENT speaker, and fast as lightening for steaming, multiple windows open, attachments to emails, and storage for music and photos. LOVE IT! I do miss a USB port larger than the lightening port, but I’ll get over it.
"
Kristine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I actually loved this except for the lack of a touch screen.  I ended up returning because of it.  The touch bar was ok but when it came to copy and pasting I had a very hard time with the mouse and there was no option to touch it.  Everything else was top of the line especially the battery life.  If they have a touch screen version I would buy it for sure.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Macbook was defective since the day it arrived. Apple refused to give me a new laptop because it was bought on Amazon and Amazon charged us a 20% restocking fee????? for returning a product that never worked as expected!
"
Steven Schendler,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So this review isn’t about the project. It’s about the sale whether intentional or unintentional of horrendously used MacBooks. Amazon shipped a cosmetic damaged, unwiped,  not sealed properly MacBook. I did a return/replace and the second MacBook was not as bad cosmetically but had programs installed in the file system that aren’t native. Also although cosmetic damage was minor compared to the first one it was still a used MacBook at a new MacBook price. I had zero interest in writing a review but I was prompted so I did.
"
Clarkb286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The performance of this machine (CPU, memory, SSD, and GPU speed) is outstanding. The battery lasts over 10x longer than my previous laptop, a Lenovo Thinkpad T490. The display is bright (500 nits) and beautiful. The laptop is ultra-portable, weighing less than 3 lbs. Either the cooling fans on this laptop are so quiet that they're inaudible, or else they've never come on! macOS Big Sur is intuitive and feature-rich, and the fact that the OS is based on Unix makes software development a delight. The only criticism that I have with this machine is that it only has 2 Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports; an external USB-C hub/adapter/dongle is required if one needs HDMI, USB-A, Ethernet, SDHC, DisplayPort, or VGA connectivity. The price / performance of the M1 MacBook Pro is hard to beat!
"
Janet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really like my purchase of the MacBook Pro. It is super fast. The colors on the screen are bright & clear. I love the the 13 inch screen. It’s the perfect size for me.

  I love Apple when it comes to computing. Their software is efficient, error free and easy to use. Their computers perform efficiently and they virtually never freeze up. The only issue with my last Mac was that the mag safe power cord would consistently fray and the hard drive cable had to be replaced 3x over 8 years (should change every 2-3 yrs). This mac hasnt given me any problems in the first couple days. I did notice a lot of software and drivers dont seem to support the new Apple chips yet, but I have no doubt it will eventually happen.
"
Jamilla Webb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I never make reviews but I have to make one for this. I’ve had this computer since March and it’s June now, and I have to say, I really, really, really love my computer. It’s super fast and the speakers are loud and it’s everything you could want. My only issue is that there is no USB port. When I’m editing I find it very difficult to use the mousepad because I can’t be precise with my work the way I do with a mouse. I just bought an adapter today, and I hope it makes my editing much more easier. But all I can say is that I spent a lot of money upgrading my 2011 MacBook Pro and I decided to just buy this computer with my stimulus check and it was the best decision I’ve ever made.
"
Tracy Campbell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really only used my Apple Watch for tracking activity and reading texts. I could never really respond to texts unless I wanted to use the canned responses. This one actually lets you type a response. Mind you the keyboard is SMALL but it's perfectly useable. I also love that the battery life is such that you can use it to track sleep and it charges really fast. I thought the 41mm would be so much bigger than my Series 1 but it's not and the new design allows the face to be used more efficiently. Glad I upgraded.
"
Jeresika,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the first Apple Watch I’ve ever had and I absolutely love it. Sure it doesn’t come with a charging block like a lot of the one star reviews point out BUT they are sold literally everywhere and you can upgrade your charging game and get a fancy affordable charging doc for all your stuff anyways 🤌🏻,The app for the watch is super smooth and easy. Set up only took 15 min max. Comfortable to wear and fun to personalize. Messaging and phone calls work no problem. All of the apps are easy to use.

"
ucandoit,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really like the series 7 apple watch. Many improvements over the series 3. That was a good watch too.,The watch face choices seem to go on and on!  The 41mm size seems to fit me better than the 38mm.,The extra features are really nice. You can read all about them when you go to Apple website. I got the blue watch, matches my new blue iphone12. Took 4 days to receive it.  Guess this is a very busy time of year.,If you are a fan of apple watches, then you will love the series 7.
"

  I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas. He can’t carry his cell phone at work, so it allows him to get his messages as well as keep track of his physical activities, heart rate, pulse and blood pressure.,He has told me several times how glad he is that I purchased it for him.
"
Christopher R. Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I considered buying a used apple watch a couple years ago, because the current watch at the time didn't seem to do much more than the older watches. Then the 7 was going to come out with always on feature, and larger screen, which for me was the thing I wanted. I'm so far loving it. The ability to switch between always on faces means it can go from looking like an elegent watch (plain, artistic face) to utilitarian with a swipe. The added health features are a bonus. Although I don't really need them, I could see those features being very handy for an older user that's trying to monitor changes to heart rate, O2 saturation, etc.
"

  Another home run for Apple. Live getting phone calls on my wrist snd responding to texts quickly. The face is nice snd clear… great color too!  But really, they couldn’t throw in the wall plug for the charger ? Remember to get an extra one so you can charge from a wall plug .  But I do love my watch!
"
CZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the watch. It’s so cool that the you can use your own photos as the face of it.,4 stars because apple doesn’t provide the USB-C adapter in order to plug in to charge.  I would’ve been fine if it was a regular usb but it requires a usb-c.  I ordered one for $10.
"

"
Carlos,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Alright, I won’t say the Apple Watch is the best watch in the world because I know not everyone will agree with me but gosh is it really useful. Although this stainless steel version is on the pricier side, it sure is durable with the sapphire glass that’s resistant to scratches and the stainless steel chassis case, more durable than the aluminum version at least. If you’re like me and try to take advantage of all the Apple Watch features, it’s a great buy. If you’re someone who uses smart watches more casually such as for time, messages, notifications, etc. then I would reconsider and maybe think about getting a different smart watch unless you’re willing to learn all the features that are available on it.
"
Cynthia Rusak,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Charger didn’t work. Apple needed to back erase the contents from the watch to be able to send me a new charger and it took several conversations with Amazon to get it resolved. Each time was a different answer. One told me they could do nothing unless I wanted to return the entire purchase for a replacement. I was finally offered a credit to be able to purchase a new charger. I would have been better of going to my mobile provider to get the watch and the support that took a week to resolve here.
"
Chuck,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Apple Watch itself is great and as advertised. But I would order from another site. I tried using Amazon's 12 month equal pay option, but they ended up still charging the full amount without notifying me of any changes. Despite using an Amazon card, it took 2 emails, 10 minutes of online chat, and then 20 minutes on the phone to get the billing rectified. Customers shouldn't have to spend an hour of their time to resolve a billing issue on the seller's side, much less when it's the seller's credit card being used. Not the best look for such an established company. The month delay in shipping due to the supply chain issues is understandable, the effort on resolving issues that are in Amazon's control, is not.
"
jomama,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I absolutely hated that this did not come with a charger. Now I am stuck home with Covid for Christmas and I have a useless Apple Watch that I cannot charge. To add insult to injury the correctApple chargers Cost a minimum of $30 and are not available on Amazon for over two weeks. So now I have a Watch that I cannot use and I cannot go out and get a charger. Apple sucks to package their watch in an unusable state. At the very least a small adapter should come in the original package. Gave battery life accuracy and mobile app all bad reviews because they cannot be used without a charge.
"
D. B. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded from a Series 4 Apple Watch. I like the ""always on"" display and the added blood oxygen measurement. Other than that it doesn't do much of anything that the older watch doesn't do. But IMO it's enough to justify the upgrade.,FWIW, the slightly larger display isn't at all obvious. Is it a little bigger? Yes. But if I wasn't told beforehand I'd never have noticed!
"
Leesa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So, the battery lasts about a day, but I take mine off at night and charge it. It definitely lasts a full day though. I really enjoy being able to see my updates and texts without having to take my phone out of my pocket, which is very helpful with the group family texts :) It also helps save time when the phone rings as you can see who is calling, again without taking the phone out of the pocket.  I'm still learning how to utilize it to its fullest extent, but I do really like it and I'm so very happy that I splurged for it for myself.
"
T. Baird,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch is almost what I expected.  However, for the money, I expected to receive the ability to charge it.  Shame on Apple for their greed and lack of customer service.  I received this for Christmas and couldn’t use it until the stores were open and I could buy a charger.
"
Mousetivity,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Going from Android to iOS was a little strange, at first, but I’m so glad I did. This watch has been wonderful to wear. It’s stylish look and the health apps has been the most important reason for the switch. I hope to keep this for at least a couple years. That is until they release the much rumored blood glucose monitor in the near future

SAHI,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Received a defective Watch whose display won’t turn on even after 2hrs of charging it! First Amazon delivers it late. Second it doesn’t turn on. Third the Amazon app does not have a “replacement” option. Only return. How will I get this Watch back on thanksgiving deal that I purchased it on?! Very bad experience with Amazon!
"
vanhalen26505,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded from a second-generation model to this one. I dislike that you have to pay so much more to get one with the Milanese loop band and have to get a cellular model to get the dark color. This basically does nothing more than the ones that are several hundred dollars but are about twice the price. That is the negative. On the positive side, I like the always-on display, the EKG function, and the larger display. I look forward to a time when these become thinner and have longer battery life. I would buy it again.

  If you need complete silence to concentrate on tasks for your job or school assignments, and you want earbuds that will cancel out unwanted noise, these are awful. You can literally hear everything else going on in the world alongside your music playlist, favorite podcast, or calming white noise.,But if you think you can just raise the volume higher on these AirPods to try and combat the unwanted noise, then you end up with a lot of sound bleed. This results in everyone being able to hear what YOU are listening to. It's like having mini speakers on the side of your head.,This is bad because I have some songs that I personally like, but my friends tease me for liking them. Why would I want others to hear what I'm listening to? It's for just me to enjoy. If I wanted a speaker, I'd buy a speaker.,I will say that the head track feature is kinda cool, but the other con vastly outweighs this pro.

  Insert (properly) in ear - bad fit, crown is too bulbous / bulky to fit - uh oh ...,Search for directions / help forums - THIS IS A WELL KNOWN ISSUE!!!,Wear 1-2 minutes, it's in my lap while sitting still not talking not chewing.,Use (for intenede purpose) to make call - within 30 seconds, it's in my lap or on the floor.,Every attempt to manuver to catch or re-insert a falling pod while on a call results in an accidental press of poorly placed terminate call button - UNDESIRED CALL TERMINATION.,I'm sure they can do much better for those with incompatibly shaped ears (didn't they test before RTM?),Sound quality was quite good.,Bulky charging case was rediculous should be able to just drop onto mag charger,never challanged battery life because they would not stay in my ears - boing!!! under chair!!!,sheesh!,Final Rating: negative 2billion out of 10,Returned with predjudice and for cause.

  Full disclosure, I used to have the airpod 1st gen but I ditched it due to minor inconveniences , and went back to wired headphone till the 3rd gen came out, here’s are my problem with the 1st: long stamps sticking out my ears, no button, wire charging and I always forget to charge.,The 3rd nearly fixed all the problem I faced, shorter in length, added button, wireless charging and longer battery life, however the bud itself are bigger in size (as shown on picture), so it did take me some time getting used to, once you adjusted to it you should be fine.,The surrounded sound is pretty cool that’s not on any other models.,No sound cancellation at all just to keep in mind, if that was what you are looking for then you should skip this model.

  So I have the original, first generation, AirPods. Love them, worked great. Decided to upgrade with the Black Friday deal, mostly because the mic had stopped working in my original pair. First off taking them out of the case. What genius designed this? You literally have to rotate them 180 degrees in order to put them in your ears with the way they lay in the case. The fit for me ears wasn't great, they went it but not very well, at least not in my ears. Sound quality was great! Wow a big improvement. Then it comes to the controls. OK the 1st generation really got me hooked on the tap to forward, stop, etc. These you have to physically squeeze the post, which is even shorter than the other generations??? Ah that was a big no for me. Needless to say my sister is getting some AirPods for xmas. I immediately order the 2nd generation for myself.

  Leí bien antes de comprar, y vi varios videos. Por eso se lo que compre y me gustaron.,Recomiendo lo mismo a muchos, ya que puede que no le sirvan porque son un poco grandes en la oreje comparados con la 2da version. Son muy similares a los Pro a cuando se tiene puesto a simple vista.,El sonido es muy bueno, uso la funcion de Spacial audio al ver videos o pelicular. Siri me escucha desde que la llamo y en breves segundo ejecuta el comando que le doy.,La bateria practicamente nunca se me ha descargado por completo, ya que desde que los dejo de usar lo guardo en su cajita, la cual dicho sea de paso tambien proteje.,Asi rapido no tengo quejas. Solo, reitero, leer bien antes de comprar y seguro gustaran tambien.,Aproveche descuento maximo en BF y una promo de mi Credit Card, Me salio mas de un 50% off de lo que cuesta normalmente.

  i’ve had both the airpods gen 1 and 2 and tried the airpod pros for a few days that i borrowed from a friend. i like these the most out of all of them. they don’t fall out that easily, only if you shake your head a lot or fall asleep on your side (like the 1st and 2nd gen).,i like these a lot more compared to the pros. the rubber was uncomfortable and transparency mode amplified the outside noise but the only other option (to my knowledge) was noise cancelling. i wear only one airpod most of the day because i’m in class and the pros were awkward with only using one.,the sensor buttons on the stem are a lot more convenient than the gen 1 and 2 and since it supports spatial music, i’d recommend this over those.
"
Angel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Good for big ears, bad for small ears.,Unlike the gen 1, this doesn’t fit well into the ear. I cannot use the AirPods Pro because of the “suction cup” like ear pieces on it so the gen 1 was amazingly perfect for me.,I got really excited to see the gen 3 without the rubber ear pieces and purchased them right away!,BUT OH MY GOSH!! They do not fit well in the ear at all! I get the point is for noise cancellation but I seriously can’t keep them in for the life of me. All I have to do is smile and they fall out of my ear.,But if you have bigger ears, this is good! My boyfriend absolutely loved them. They fit him nice. But me, not so much.,Just a warning for the small eared people out there. Lol
"
Radioman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am quite happy with these. The sound is fantastic (great bass) crisp and clear. I use them for music and my phone. They pair up quickly with no problems.,My only issue is, on my Pro's, when I would open the case, a pop-up on my phone would show me the charge level of both the case and the pods. I haven't seen that with these. Is there something I need to activate or does that function simply not exist for these? Maybe just an included function of the higher prices Pro's?
"
TexasFrog,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  AirPods 3 sound incredible. Seriously incredible, and a massive upgrade on AirPods 2 if you have a device capable of Apple’s Spatial Audio. Every bit as good as AirPods Pro, and I think they actually sound better then my wife’s Pros. More “full,”’whereas the Pros sound more focused in my ears. The spatial audio really does add immersive audio and battery life is great.,But there are two big downsides:,1. There is ALOT of sound leak.  A massive amount more than AirPods 2. Anyone within 10 feet will hear them, and anyone within five will clearly know exactly what you are listening to.,2. The earpiece is 50% larger than AirPods 2, and it is noticeable.  After 15 minutes, my ears began to ache, and after an hour they hurt. I can wear my AirPods 2 for 5 hours and forget they’re in, but not these.,I’m revising my initial review, as the audio quality surpasses the cons. Over time, my ears adapted to the fit, and it became less of a problem. I would like to see Apple address it and the sound leak, because the sound quality is equal or better than the Pros at less money.
"
Michelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are very difficult to secure in the ears. It’s true what a ton of reviews say, that they fall out randomly, often. Can’t be talking or eating as the motion of the jaw will knock them loose. Another thing, the ‘clicking’ of the button on the stem, eehhhhh it’ll take some getting used to.
"
Maxx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Spent a lot of time trying to decide if I should get an iPad Pro, and i made the right decision. There are no apps that take advantage of the M1 chips, and even if there was, the OS on the iPad is just not up to par for that power. The touch recognition works much better than the old style with the home button. And, the removal of the home 🏡 button really works. I was worried at first, but once you start using the top button, it works great. If you need a laptop, then get one. If Apple 🍏 ever unleashes the OS on the iPad I would definitely upgrade, but it’s just not there now. I’ll use my MacBook Pro when I need to get more done, and use my new iPad Air for relaxing 😎

Sky ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I needed an iPad for note-taking and writing on PDF’s. Since classes are online now, it was so annoying to write down notes or do homework and have to take pictures of it and upload to my MacBook. This works GREAT for college students. I downloaded Notability immediately and it’s been working great so far. I bought the Apple Pencil and the case from amazon as well. You get it for $50 off here on Amazon from the original price so I think it’s a great price point. I just wouldn’t replace my MacBook with my iPad. Its very useful to have both. ONLY THING IS, make sure you’re home around the delivery time! You don’t want anyone stealing your package with $800+ worth of products in.

Rusty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought this to replace my 7 yr old iPad Air 2, couldn’t be happier with the result. Never been one to need the newest, nicest Apple product but decided to get something I knew would last as long as my last one. Very fast processor. Able to handle all of my apps for work and leisure with ease. Highly recommend this iPad.

Option,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pleasantly surprised with the condition! I purchased a green iPad Air in “good condition” and according to the description I was expecting some scratches and missing apple stickers. As far as I can tell there’s not a scratch on it, and both apple stickers were in the box.,I’ve been using it daily since it arrived for long drawing sessions (8-10 hours in procreate) and it’s run perfectly. On a full charge the battery is lasting about 9ish hours.,The screen size is more than enough to work on and the response with the apple pen (2nd gen) is smooth and flawless.,Very happy with my purchase!
"
B Flythe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve been using an old IPad for years.  When I say old, I’m talking Generation 3, well before the IPad Air, Mini or Pro.  It was starting to run really slow and I thought it was time to upgrade.  I’m very pleased that I did.  This IPad is improved in so many ways.  It is lighter with a bigger screen (more actual screen and less “border”), much better camera, much fast processor and I was shocked to see that it charges via Type C versus the usual Lightning Cable!  This means it charges FAST!  Battery life is not as good as my old one, but it charges so fast I don’t even notice!

Tonio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This was the first apple device I have owned since my iPod touch in like 2007. I have never really had a need for one and always thought they were unnecessarily expensive. Now I have a little bit of money so it wasn’t as much of an objection to me, plus I wanted to try out iOS and have an opinion of it myself. Instead of sticking with Android without knowing both sides.,I have to say, this was one of my best purchases recently. This is exactly what you would want in an tablet. I can’t compare it to other tablets or tell you if it’s an improvement from the previous generations. All I know is that I’m so very happy with this device.,Just before this I bought a surface so that I can increase my productivity. While I enjoyed it and it’s practical uses, I had to return it after using this iPad because it does everything I need it to, honestly, and the battery last much longer. There are a lot of things I can say but there’s not much I can go over that you can’t find on YouTube or other reviews.,I’m just another happy customer.

Anonymous,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This review is for the digital artist experienced and non experienced, die hard WACOM users and other tablet brand users with varying user experiences and preferences.,My beloved mobile studio Pro 16 battery swole and died, so this iPad is a temporary substitute.,If you have never drawn on an iPad, but you've seen all the Procreate jazz on social media and wondering if it's just being hyped up, well it's being hyped up, but honestly. It's worth trying. And I will detail the pros and the cons to help you off standing on the fence of buying or not buying.,Pros- 1. Very Sharp Screen (no pixelated 1080 HD), 2. Light to carry and easy to hold in one hand than the bigger 12.9,3. Has finger print reader on power button (it works flawlessly, especially if you are in a situation you have to keep on your masks, it's great),4. Apple pen is new to me but surprisingly comfortable to use. I'm accustomed to the WACOM stylus, however don't let that deter you. The pen pressure is up there with sensitivity, tilt and smooth lines (no shaky lines or parallax) very accurate. You will get used to it. Currently using Clip Studio Paint on the iPad and I like how it feels over Procreate. Both good apps.,5. Speaker quality is nice and crisp, some likeable bass.,6. Battery life is decent when running everything.,7. The device is fast, you can tweak some settings to make it run more snappy.,8. 60htz refresh rate helps you save power, and you won't notice it unless it's next to the iPad with 120htz proMotion. You don't need proMotion to enjoy drawing and using the iPad air 4.,9. Apple pen charges fast in minutes.,10. iPad air 4 CHARGES FAST. Uses USB C.,Cons-,1. Pen loses charge quickly when left alone and I believe if you keep it docked to the device it runs the battery of the iPad down quicker to keep the pen juiced. So what I do is, if I'm not drawing I don't charge the pen on the iPad until I'm ready to draw. But it lasts a good while, nothing to worry about on a full charge.,2. Screensize can seem smaller when using the drawing apps especially if you are used to a larger screen. Therefore, icons are tiny, but not impossible to use tiny.,3. It's expensive.,4. Uses apps which you might have to pay subscription fees for certain features and may not have all the features like on your computer.,Overall, I don't think it's meant to be replacement for power user digital artists tools but it will definitely supplement your life as an artist on the go or home. It is a very capable device in my opinion. I am getting used to it positively.,If this is only for drawing, go for it! It can handle it very well!,If it's drawing, video editing, image editing, heavy graphic design, I'm not so sure because of app limitations Vs software.,@kingsonalli on IG. Hope I helped you!

Chris,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had the very first iPad Air and while the 4th gen is much faster and smoother, the TouchID button is very fragile! Accidentally dropped my iPad with a case on it, everything was okay except the TouchID button. It look scratched, but I guess the scratch messes up the TouchID technology so it no longer works. It’s not something Apple can fix too. They charge you $410 to get it replace. Would not recommend such an expensive fragile tablet. Also read online that this is a common issue with iPad Air..
"
Geronimo L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The iPad Air 4 is an amazing tablet! It's responsive and comparable to it's 2020 iPad Pro cousin in many ways except for storage; 64 gigs of storage is simply not enough.,After having the device for a little better than two weeks, I found myself deleting apps to conserve storage. Keep in mind that iOS will automatically use 10 gb of storage. If you're an EXTREMELY light user, who mainly use this device to browse the web, social media or stream, you'll probably fair well with the smaller storage. However, if you plan to use the device for any type of productivity (leave alone creativity), it's best to opt for the higher storage.,I returned my 64 gb device in exchange for the 128 gb iPad Pro, which would better serve my needs.
"
Diego,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this ipad as an upgrade to a previous 2018 base model. I wasn't sure about upgrading to the Air, but I'm glad I did. I like the design without the button, like the newer iPhones, and the screen is larger and nicer. It also supports charging the apple pen wirelessly, which is a great feature.,If you are on the fence between models, here are the differences that I think make it worth the extra money:,1) Charge apple pen wirelessly,2) Better (larger) screen,3) USB Type C connector,4) Faster processor,5) Overall nicer design
"
Sahil R,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The 128gb version actually comes only with the 8GB ram. There are no apps which make use of it, and to properly use this item, you need so many additional purchases of warranty and applecare+ and pencil etc. The item gets really overpriced really fast and then is not worth it anymore.
"
Nika,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What Can I say?,Everything in this tablet is perfect,Starting with the form factor (ideal size) and ending with performance and battery life.,Even the screen is amazing. Black look really black to me. I would rather save $100 and do not have mini led then pay +100$ for mini led. Brightness is more than enough for me and HDR videos also look amazing.,Just buy it. This tablet will last easily for next 5-6 years if you do not break it. :)

  It was time. My wife's ten-year-old iPad was still an OK e-mail reader, but little more.

Louis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The size is nice. Easy to draw on. Performance is mind blowing good. Nomad sculpt runs so smooth on this tablet. I also like using procreate, because I can make many layers with the extra ram. I wish it was lighter. Because holding it for a long time makes my hand hurt. Also I wish the screen was etched glass. So the pen would have better grip when drawing. But overall I love this tablet.
"
Jacobs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This iPad replaced a seventh generation iPad.  It was purchased because the wi-fi in the older iPad was not working well.  The iPad Pro Wes purchased because of the face recognition feature.  This feature alone makes the higher cost worth it.  The screen is much clearer and the speed is great.
"
snapshooter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Loads quick, screen quality is great, It comes with face recognition. It works fine but I tink I liked the finger print better. I generally use the password on this new unit. The speed is most  noticable When doing heavy work load. Thats when it shines. Very happy I upgraded.
"
Selei Cho,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this iPad to save me some space for notes and to, virtually, have a mobile, all-knowing notebook. And it did just that. I can do almost anything I want to on it, including writing notes in the way I want to. I don’t need to use it for anything else, so if you’re simply looking for a huge, virtual, mobile notebook, this is definitely for you.

Crystal Dittman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What can I say? It’s exactly the same as the 8th gen but with minor upgrades. But it’s also the same price so no one can REALLY complain. These iPads are not processing powerhouses but they are durable, cheap, and replaceable. I’ve bought a half dozen of them from different suppliers to use as prompters and lyric sheets from my churches worship team.,They have great battery, a clear screen, great build quality, and low cost.,If you wanna edit 4k videos I doubt you want an iPad, if you do, get a Pro, if you don’t, get a 2020 MacBook Pro M1 (it’s flawless), if you are just getting started, test the waters with this before you drop $1000.

  Apple's choice to make an inexpensive iPad like this that doesn't cut corners really makes me happy. It's nice to be able to get something brand new instead of refurbished or second hand.,Great battery life, plenty of storage, excellent screen, and that premium iPad software. I just wish it were slightly smaller like the iPad Air, but that's just a preference rather than a complaint.

Christopher England,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my second iPad. The first one is still kicking after 10 years, but it's showing its age. This one has been a nice update. Personally, the only way I could see somebody disappointed with this is if they have unreasonable expectations or they're an Apple hater. It works as described and the price is pretty good. I hope this one is still operational in 10 years like my old one.

  I use a majority of android products except for when it comes to tablets . I've owned iPad since the very first one they came out with. There are still some things in which Apple is still the better product and it's definitely tablets. The camera could be better but I don't use the camera on tablets very much anyway. If you want the most bang for your buck Apple model is for you.

Does anyone know what hearing device that is compatible with this IPad IOS 15.2? Not all hearing devices are compatible with this IPad. I highly recommend this seller’s product.

  I’ve had several iPads in the last 15 years they never die, over the years I gave two away and bought a new one about 18 months ago. My niece is in her early 30’s and I just bought her this one as a gift a few weeks ago. She was thrilled to get it and is very appreciative to have her own first ever iPad. I also sent her a Targus brand case to use with it. It’s a little pricey but in my opinion worth it, and I don’t buy them that often. I like that my iPad syncs with my iPhone SE second generation, so it shares my messaging and photos and bookmarks, quite handy.

  I have had multiple fitbits in the past.  I finally broke down and purchased the new series 7 Apple Watch.  I love the look and all the features.  It did take a little time to get setup.  I had to install a new update in my iPhone before I could setup the Watch.  It works great and has some really nice features.  The only flaw I found so far is with charging.  I was disappointed to find that the Watch came with a USB-c charger cord only with no plug for the wall outlet.  I had to plug the cord into my computer to charge.

Hopefully, it will all work out great for her once she receives it.

  I bought 3 of these watches for my kids for Christmas and was shocked at how much it can do. Their favorite app is the walkie talkie.  I also bought them different colored watch bands and they were able to easily switch them out to match different outfits.  Would buy one for myself if I wasn't an android user.

  So I am comparing these to the standard 2nd gen which I really liked except they tended to fall out of my ears if I tilted my head in any particular direction. The Dolby Atmos and taunts of fitting better than the 2nd gen Airpods and being more similar to the pros prompted me to try these out as soon as they were available. My first impressions were that they are extremely slippery almost designed to be so that I bobbled them more often than not and the fit in the case was much much more awkward than the 2nd gen ones. All that aside I hoped that the sound quality would make up for any other qualms I had. I immediately subscribed to a free trial of Apple music as that seemed to be the best music test by all accords. With all the quality settings turned up I don't really notice a huge difference between 2nd gen and 3rd gen Airpods. Swapping the  two back and forth between songs what I concluded is the 3rd gen had a better dynamic range but not so much that it made the 2nd gen sound awful as far as ear pods go.
"
Mary,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What a solid upgrade from 2nd Gen! I owned the 1st gen, 2nd gen, and the airpods pro, and I think this one (3rd gen) is the most balanced in terms of sound quality, comfort, and convenience. Comparing to 2nd gen, there is a noticeable upgrade in sound, especially in bass. The spatial audio and pinch control is also a big plus. Comparing to the pros, I think the sound quality is on par, but the wear comfort level is much much better than the all-sealed pros. If you are comfortable with 1st and 2nd gen, the 3rd gen will be a pleasure to use and wear (for hours!). But if you already have a pair of Pros and feel comfortable wearing them, then there is no need for moving to the 3rd gen. Also since they are not sealed over your ears, noise canceling is pretty much non-existent, so that is a big red flag if you care about noise canceling. For my use case, 3rd gen is awesome!
"
Morgan L.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These were so disappointing! After borrowing my moms 2nd gen AirPods for a week I decided I liked them enough to get my own. I figured it made more sense to get the newest model but unfortunately that was a mistake. The 3rd gen are so much bigger, the part that goes in your ear anyways, and are unbearably painful. I do have small ears, but never have I had earbuds break the skin in my ear causing scabs, and bruising from trying to get them to stay in. They also shorted the stem on the 3’s which could have been fine had they not added the force touch controls. There’s just no way for me to grip the stem in the right place without accidentally pulling the whole AirPod out. That problem is probably amplified by my nails, which are only 1/4 inch long, but even without nails it still seems like such a bad design. I love Apple products, I wish I could get behind these, they’re just awful overall :(
"
joe,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Hardly fit in my ears, I’m a big guy! 6’2” 280lbs and they barely go in my average size ears! Very large and these do NOT have the interchangeable ear tips! Be ready to return them…….,Sound quality is a little above average but can’t get a proper evaluation because they don’t fit my ears too well, they aren’t noise canceling like their predecessors, I guess overall I’d give them a three, and definitely would NOT recommend them.
"
Georgia Scott,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  In case there’s anyone out there like me with ears that were practically made for the original airpod design, these do not fit the same. They fall out constantly making it a really difficult experience. I’m in meetings all day and need to wear headphones for confidentiality purposes. I had to adjust these constantly which provided feedback to the other people on the calls. The sound quality was good but the only notable difference was the spatial audio. Cool but not a necessary feature for me. For some reason my ears must have a very particular shape because I’ve also tried the AirPods Pro and they don’t work for me either, constantly unsealing and falling out.,If you are like me and struggle with finding earbuds that fit, and the original AirPods fit your ears, I warn you that these might prove to be too large!!
"
Sweetipienoble,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely hated it. I had the 2nd generation, lost it, and replaced with this one. It was a constant battle to keep them in my ears, a problem I did not have with my 2nd generation. The noice quality was also not too much louder or sound concealing, considering how much more you’re paying. Sent them back and reordered 2nd generation. Still waiting on a refund,Update. It is now officially 3 weeks later and I am STILL waiting on a refund

Alejandro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excelentes , cumplieron mis expectativas, al principio tenia dudas porque muchos decian que se salian de los oidos fácilmente y como a mi los airpods pro no me quedaban por los chuponcitos dudaba de estos, pero decidi correr el riesgo y mas cuando vi la oferta de Amazon de ahorrarme $30 dls de su precio original, ya los tengo y para mi fortuna me quedaron perfectos, no se salen ni me lastiman, asemas el audio es mejor que los airpods 1 y 2, por lo que que estoy mas que satisfecho por mi compra, sin duda los volvere a comprar mas adelante para tener el repuesto de estos cuando ya se me empiecen a poner viejitos. Para mi es un dedito arriba solido👍

  The new 3rd Generation Apple AirPods are simply incredible. They are comfortable, easy to use, and offer an unmatched quality of sound!,They arrived within 2 business days, and once I opened them and took out the earbuds, they automatically connected to my iPhone, which indicated on its screen the battery life of both of the AirPods and the charging case. There is a lightning charging cable included.,They aren’t completely noise cancelling like the AirPods Pro, but they offer a slew of incredible features—use of Siri, long battery life, incredible sound quality, in-call use, sweat and water resistance, and detectors and sensors for ease of use! The microphone is amazing—I’ve heard from many people that it sounds even better than my iPhones microphone while talking on the phone!,The instruction booklet is very helpful, but they are so easy to use that you probably won’t need to refer to it! Apple has left me completely satisfied, and you truly do get what you pay for when it comes to wireless headphones!

daphne g,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The AirPods 2nd generation fit me great and I was so excited to try these, unfortunately they were too big for my delicate 20 something female ears. They hurt after a while and eventually fell off. I know the older version has the different head options, but I don’t like how those suction my ear holes. Apple needs to come up with a new version with permanent smaller heads and all the new features ☹️
"
Dan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They fit better than previous generations.  However they seem to have done some directional work to make it feel like what you’re listening to is in the room or more vivid or,Something.  I actually don’t like that.  It’s almost creepy and echoey.  I listen to a lot of talk and news and I don’t want to think the anchor is over my shoulder.

  I love everything about my new Apple iPad Air except for it’s battery life.  I will fully charge it overnight then unplug it to watch a movie and the battery nearly dies by the end of the movie so I need to charge it again before watching anything else. My other iPad has a longer battery life even though it’s 8 years old.  So I dim the screen’s brightness on my new on and lower the volume so battery life lasts 3-4 hours.  Disappointing.

  I do tech support and have been in the computer business for 26 years and as a hobbyist since 1976. and for about the last 9 years I have been doing remote support for mobile devices both Apple and Android. I have watched the two devices move closer and closer together as far as features. When iOS 14 came out and they made widgets available on iPhones, I thought Why didn't they do this for the iPad? Well, now they will be. It will be interesting to compare screens once they do. I also own a Samsung Tab S7+ both tablets are top quality.,One giant step backwards was removing the split screen keyboard option on the Air 4, and the Pros. I had to search for a 3rd part keyboard. Which on iOS there are not a lot of. Dumb move on an otherwise great device.

Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The rose gold color is fantastic. All of the case tones are beautiful and soft. Any choice will be a great option.,Battery life on the first day lasted over several hours of videos, gaming, general web browsing, managing my inbox, and setting up new apps.,Size is about the same as a spiral notebook. It weighs very little, but I put a very protective Valkit case on it which increased the weight quite a bit.,Screen is good, not amazing, but suits most average users’ needs.,Apple Pencil 2 support is a great feature and makes this iPad even more fun to use. There is basically no latency when drawing or writing- you won’t notice it if you haven’t used a pro model iPad or high end tablet.,Speakers are OK. I wish they had 4 speakers instead of 2, but I am most likely to use my headphones when watching videos, so it doesn’t matter much.,WiFi + Cellular is a must! Having GPS and cellular connectivity means you can use your iPad anywhere and for any purpose with ease. Most data plans for iPad are super cheap and easy to add to your phone plan. Just do it!,Amazon Warehouse Deals review:,This iPad was marked down significantly in price and marked as “Used - Very Good”. The description indicated that the iPad would be slightly scuffed and the packaging would be damaged.,I was willing to take the trade-off since it also included cellular and didn’t even cost as much as the base model.,What I received made me really happy! ipad had no damage and included a Paperlike screen protector already installed. The box was opened and resealed with tape, it had a dent on the front and a sticker. The contents were all there and properly packaged.  It was a great deal and I’d buy a AWD product again.

  Screen,I really love going through social media watching YouTube videos and texting, I’m texting way more than I did in the past 5 years and the onscreen keyboard is so great to use. One thing I do want to complain about is that the blue light that this tablet outputs must be very high because the day I started using this tablet I found it way harder to fall asleep. Be sure to turn on Night Shift to get some good hours of Zzzz. Besides that the screen is great and in my experience it’s the perfect size for using it as a tablet, if you’re going to use it more for a laptop get the big IPad Pro.,Battery,This is going to be short. The battery is very great, it has a 7606mAh battery and it goes for days without a charge. I don’t play any games on it but I do use it as a laptop for college and it still does very great. The 60Hz screen must really help battery life because this tablet with very heavy usage can go for about 3 days until it dies. If you are worried about battery life don’t be because it’s great.,Processing power,To help you understand this has the same A14 Bionic as the iPhone 12, it’s crazy fast. This will handle any game, college work, photo editing anything you can think of. It does only have 4GB of ram but it doesn’t seem to slow it down in any way. With the amount of power this thing has it will still be fast 3 years from now. To make this short I’m more worried about the world ending than this tablet being slow in the next few years.,Connectivity,Connecting to my iPhone XS was super easy and both work together so seamlessly like I can’t even explain it. I haven’t had any issues connecting to my speakers, keyboard, WiFi router, texting (just so you know your iPhone has to be on to be texting from your tablet), everything works great. I used to have issues with my S4 connecting to my speakers and issues connecting to my WiFi router with my laptops and it makes me very happy to see that so far I haven’t had any issues with this tablet.

  When I opened the packaging everything was sealed, everything was there. The battery is good. The shade of green is super cute- like a pastel pistachio green. Takes decent photos. The sound is insanely loud. I got a paper-like screen protector to draw on so the screen doesn’t look as crisp as it does without it but I’m willing to make that trade for not scratching up the actual screen. Anyways if you’re an artist 10/10 recommend getting this bc it’s cheaper than the pro and I can do so much with it!!
"
Albert,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  TLDR: The so-called ""File system"" is a nightmare for Photographers.  If you are not willing to totally change your workflow for Ipad OS (which is not easy to do), Ipad is not for you. No matter how good the hardware is.,I have been a long-time Android user who also loves taking pictures using his DSLR. Last year I saw I pad air gaining popularity because it had a file system and USB c port.,The iPad air has a stellar screen, Fast processor, and guaranteed  4 years of support from apple. Seems like a no brainers for a photographer like me who wants to import photos, edit them and post them on social media. I was totally wrong :(.,The file system:,The camera roll (photo gallery) does NOT share same space with the file system at all. You will have to COPY the photos from external drive to internal memory, THEN save those images to Photos and ONLY then you are able to see those pictures in your Photos app.,External storage support using the USB c is trash. Some of my memory cards don't show up in the file system at all, I have to plug them back in multiple times to work.,The final nail in the coffin was when I was trying to import the RAW files to Photos . THE RAW FILES DIDN'T SHOW UP IN PHOTOS. They were perfectly saving into the photos app before..... but why not now?,OK you know what, may be it is my fault that I am using snapseed app for editing my photos, I should get an app that is MADE FOR IPAD. Guess what, there is no good photo editing app for Ipad unless you PAY for it. I am not a professional, I just need an app as good as snapseed on Ipad :( without paying for it.,MOST big-name social media apps DO NOT have a version that works on Ipad. The same version as phones but stretched out on IPads' beautiful screen with crappy resolution.,The Ipad is probably everything a long-time iPhone user needs but it falls short when some one like me comes in to do productivity tasks. Either do it the Ipad way or else.....,Apple will never make the Ipad OS better because it will eat up their Macbook sales. I also use a Macbook for work and it is far better than Ipad OS.  I know a lot of people will downvote this but I tried my best to like the Ipad and failed.

Robert Sabin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Remember when each new version of an Apple product used to be an improvement? those days are long gone. Each new iteration of the iPad is significantly worse than the last, with a frustrating lack of attention to basic problems that keep the OS in the dark ages. How do you screw up an on off button? Well in this case you make sure it won’t turn on when you press the on button.  Instead you have to hold it down for an indeterminate amount of time, and to turn it off you don’t just press the off button, you have to also press one of the volume buttons. Stupid. Even more frustrating, if your iPad is off (because presumably your battery is low) and you plug it in the power will just come on automatically and continue to drain your battery. Having your iPad plugged in while on will result in the need to keep it plugged in for a significant amount of time before it will become charged, if at all.  This is absolutely ridiculous and makes it almost impossible to keep a full charge on the device. The battery itself drains extremely quickly even when you turn off all of the obnoxious apple options, continuously interacting with the Internet, and Siri.  Unlike the OS for iPhone, there is no option to go into a low power mode. Moving apps on the home screen and organizing your contact is still extremely frustrating. Because they’ve gotten rid of the single button you cannot just simply return to the home screen, you were continuously trying to swipe up most of the time to no affect. To close apps is even worse you have to attempt multiple times to swipe up and hope that the various apps appear in front of you so that you can swipe yet again to turn them off. Of course this is all in an attempt to save battery life because the battery is so poor.  And because they’ve got rid of the central button and you were continuously swiping on everything your screen becomes disgustingly filled with fingerprints, grime, and dirt almost instantly.  Using a stylus is not any better as they don’t seem to have the technology right to make this an easy solution to the problem of a poorly designed tablet.  Of course the lack of a headphone jack is it an appalling omission as Apple has never been serious about quality Bluetooth and their headphones have been the most consistently avoided tech the last 20 years .  I seriously question whether anybody who designed this device has ever actually used it in a day today environment, as the developers are obviously ignorant of these obvious problems.  Apple seems to have no desire to make things better, only to clutter devices with features that become an onerous burden rather than solving problems for the user. This will definitely be my last iPad.
"
Natalie Young,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The battery is decent, I do use the iPad for a baby monitor and that kills the battery very quickly. Some of the iPad features are not working as well as I’d like. The screen freeze that prevents you from clicking out of apps works, I use to play movies for my kids without them going to other apps, but won’t let me get out of it without completely restarting the iPad. It’s nice overall but definitely not the best.

  Really frustrating to get the sim card and then not be able to connect to internet.  T-Mobile rep said it's faulty or locked.  Why would a brand new iPad be locked.? No where in description does it say it's locked.  So frustrating, it was a gift for my parents and now it's a logistical nightmare trying to help them from across the country.  My call with Amazon was horrible all they want to do is put my in a queue with Apple.  I expect if I purchase through Amazon they can help but that didn't happen.

I don't like that I have to have a credit card or PayPal attached to it. It came with a two sheet instruction and the charger. I thought a stylist pen came with it.. but it didn't. I am sure I will be about to work with it...just not sure if I like it yet.

  Do not go to your local cell phone service store to get a Sim card. These new iPads have internal digital eSIM. You can set up a new number with your device through the device or through your Verizon or AT&T app on your phone. They tried at my local Verizon and the guy told me that he couldn’t activate and set up my new iPad and that I would Abe to return it to amazon. I figured it out all on my own right there in the store on my cell phone and iPad. Easy and straight forward.

  I’ve been wanting an iPad ever since we had them in school and I had to turn mine back in. It’s been 8 years since then and I’ve wanted to get myself one the whole time! I finally sprung for the newest entry level iPad 9th gen, and oh my god it is everything I thought it would be and more!! The screen is HUGE compared to my old school iPad! It exceeded every expectation I had and thensome!! I downloaded some games on it to try out and the graphics are INSANELY GOOD I was shocked!! The speaker quality is perfect, I just can’t get enough of this iPad!! I’ve barely put it down since I got it!! I am an Avid Apple fan with lots of their devices, I have an iPod 5th gen, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone XR, Apple Watch Series 6, AirPods 2nd gen and now I’m a proud owner of a brand new iPad 9th gen!! They’re out of stock everywhere so this is the best option there is and I was extremely pleased with this purchase!! It was originally supposed to arrive January 20th, but it came January 9th!! Super early!! If you want an iPad that’s not as pricey as the other models don’t hesitate, just buy it!!! You won’t be disappointed!! Probably my favorite apple device yet!!

Also the charger must have the USB-C version, which you must buy separately in order to charge the watch.  It does not come with the watch, order separately because the watch must be full charge for an update. It comes without the most recent update.  I spent 2 hours trying to pair, then talked to Apple Support, that could not help.  Then I read another review to find out it needed iOS 15.1 on the phone.

  I’ve never owned an Apple Watch before so with the price being basically the same as the Series 6 it was a no brained to get this one. I personally love it, I use it every single day. It tracks my fitness, I can see my notifications without needing to take out my phone, look at messages and respond to them. I’ve had no issues with it, it’s been great so far!!

  Only complaint is my computer only has 2 USB ports, of which they are specifically designed to only fit the computer charger. I can't even connect the iPhone USB to my laptop, I'd need to buy something additional in order to do that.,This laptop isn't touch screen hence the 1star for that aspect. Not many complaints though. Super light weight and i'm currently satisfied with the battery life. [I've had it for about 2 months now so it's still early].

  After getting what I paid for in cheaper PCs only lasting a couple years at a time, I decided to switch to a Mac. This version with the new chip works well and was 200 dollars off when we got it. I also love the touch bar and hope they do not get rid of it permanently in future models.  The 2020 MacBooks are great deal for the top notch performance the M1 chips have.

Thaina,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don’t know why is asking me to review the touch screen because the computer definetely doesn’t have touch screen. Anyway, I bought the MacBook Pro expecting to be better than my old MacBook Air and honestly it’s just not worth it. It is NOT noticeably faster and the battery lasts long but only if you’re not using a lot of programs, which in my case as a college student I always have a lot of tabs open and quite often I need to work on programming softwares.,Cant play silly steam games like stardew valley without overheating the laptop.

Gaby,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As soon as I tried turning it on, it asked to be charged. So I grabbed the charger it came with, but the charging end requires a piece to be put into the wall. The end of it is not a usb or micro use end, so I have to actually go out and buy one.

"
Denis Perlera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I liked everything about it: the screen’s size, the speed, and the responsiveness. It’s very thin and fit in my backpack nicely. The battery is fine just not anything special or very long-lasting. I got the 256gb version and I think I overestimated how much storage space I would use by quite a bit. I haven’t even used 40gb yet. I would recommend the 128gb if all you’re going to do is watch videos(I use Netflix and Youtube), store and edit some photos/videos, take notes, and download a few games(COD & PUBG don’t even use 5gb yet). Great overall.
"
Micah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love this iPad . It has its limitations . It’s not gonna run sketch software like a Dolby or even Mac book but for its size Amd price it’s better for me . Buying a lab top for sketching costs more than simply buying a pen and app for this .

  1. Apple M1 chip is really astonishing and amazing, Adobe family and video processing is as smooth as silk.,2. 11-inch Liquid Retina display is stunning, with FOUR SPEAKER AUDIO, movie time is a really enjoyment,3. Face ID is still that Face ID so identical to iPhone 12 Pro, BUT IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE ONE ON IPHONE AS IT CAN RECOGNIZE YOU IN EVERY DIRECTION. you don’t have to put fingers on the tinny button to get device unlocked! Bravo!,4. Amazon shipment is also the best one.
"
NoVA Reader,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm not sure why, but the battery doesn't seem to last very long at all.  If I have to use it, the first thing is usually a charge to get it back to a respectable level.  It doesn't seem to go to sleep but constantly drains the battery - between being used and not, it's really only 2-3 days between charges.  Contrast this with weeks or months with my previous Air.
"
David ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great value.  I am transitioning to using an iPad for all my computing needs and this new iPad with the M1chip AND Apple Pencil are waaay better than using a laptop.  Taking notes by hand or jotting down ideas is incredibly fast with the pencil instead of typing it out. Love this device!!!!
"
James I Reed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I filed up the storage of the 128 in maybe a week or 2 so I got the 2 tb. It’s an investment but really if apple does do one thing right it is the tablet. No android can touch it. I just wish it were more open to use mac apps. It’s the same specs. Heck the 2 tab I have had better specs. Over 1 tab and you get double the. Ram btw

  Bought the green series 7. You can barely tell that it’s green if you change the strap. You have to know it’s green or be looking for it in the right light. Could easily pass for a black or dark charcoal. The image quality is great for such a small screen. The swipe keyboard is useable, but voice to text still reigns supreme for convenience. Not sure I would have upgraded from an older version like the SE or 6. Very glad to get the 7 since coming from a Fitbit.
"
Kelsey ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really wanted one of these watches since all of my clients had them and loved them. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and the whole reason I mainly bought it- fitness tracking is constantly inaccurate. Anytime I do a work out with my peloton 50% or more of the data is missing. I’ve tried to troubleshoot the app several times as recommended by removing and redownloading and reconfiguring and nothing works. Also when I go to record a walk outside it just stops abruptly after about two minutes every single time. Doesn’t matter if my wrist is up down to the side it just does not register the work out. I wish I would’ve saved this box I would’ve completely returned it. Super disappointed.
"
nancy mandell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The actual watch is good so far aside from not including a charger adapter and having a bit of a learning curve to set up and learn the features, but the pricing on Amazon keeps fluctuating and they will not guarantee the pricing. Even if it changes within a day or two (or sometimes within hours) they'd rather you return the product and likely they will lose money having you ship it back and then having to resell it as used and then have you re-order rather than just reimburse you a few bucks. Kind of takes the excitement out of it. I'll probably just keep mine to avoid the hassle, but beware if the pricing is important to you. Took an exciting experience and just made me sad I bought it.,Watch came half charged and died by the time I went to bed, but will see how it goes fully charged.,If this is your first Apple Watch you'll probably need to look up a few tutorials, it's somewhat intuitive, but not completely.,Just wish I bought it elsewhere.
"
Vanessa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Fast set up, had to upgrade my phone but that was no problem. Took about 40 minutes, bought the USB C charger after reading the reviews but luckily my iMac at work had the connection so I charged it on that until I received the charger. With Verizon I connected the cellular in about 10 minutes through the app. $30 activation fee and $10 a month. The watch is in great condition, I also ordered a case to keep it protected. I’m really happy with my order! I also Afterpay’d this and I’m onto my 2nd payment. 5 star experience fast shipping and battery life last long when you turn off the “always on” option. I upgraded from a series 3 and so far I’m really happy with my purchase
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I mainly wanted to use this as a tracker for runs and swimming.  It tracks runs or walks fine but no better than my fit bit charger 2.  I really wanted to use it for swimming laps.  I have used it twice.  Set it for 25 yard lap. I have a manual way that I count my laps which I continued to use. I did 46 laps the Watch showed 38.  This would also make all the other data, heart rate etc less valuable.  Very very disappointing. If swimming is important part of why you wanted this watch right now I would say do not buy it.  It does not work well at all
"
Istvan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Totally worth it at the 380 discounted price. My last apple watch was a Series 0, -- the first one -- and now we have a bigger screen, great battery life and a bunch of new sensors (EKG, Oxigen, Heartbeat) that make it a non-brainer to buy.,Don't get me wrong, I still sport an Omega Speedmaster or a Brietling for high-stakes meetings, however I use the apple watch as my daily driver for everything else.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like it. I've wanted one for years and bit the bullet. Works well for tracking workout activity, receiving notifications/messages, changing/selecting music without needing to pull out my phone. Battery lasts around a day and a half. You should plan on having to charge it every day, I would say.,Problem: You literally cannot charge your watch out of the box if you do not have a usbc charging block. I own no devices that utilize this. I had to shell out more money after spending $350 on this watch. This is unacceptable. I would understand if there was no charging block for a normal usb plug in, everyone has one laying around.

  First of all, Thanks Amazon for very fast shipping even I am not a prime member. This is my second Apple Watch, my first Apple Watch was first Apple Watch came out,it's still working fine and love it, but it's time to upgrade, Apple Watch series 7 is so NOT EXPENSIVE, it has all most every necessary application that you want to have in a watch. It's easy to set up. If you like to wear a watch, then Apple Watch series 7 is a must have.

  This iPad is really good for school. If you’re looking for a device on a budget, this is the best one. Easy sharing of documents between others because nearly everyone else has an iPad.

The price is similar to that of series 6.

  There in no charger included, it is USB C but or the opposite gender of the rest of the industry.  You are forced to have an iPhone, if you have something else, don't buy.,I have an old Samsung Gear-2 and the battery lasts for more than 2 days, the Apple watch 7 barely lasts a day.,The accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the phone system.

I wish the battery lasted a bit longer but I guess with all its doing it’s not bad. I get about a day and half from the battery.

  I don’t think I can ever buy an Apple Watch again. This is the 2nd Apple Watch in 8 months lost to the lake because of the crappy design for the watch bands. They easily pop off when doing things. I’ve had them coming off when around the house or in the car, and of course, at the lake. Twice!! The bands suck! Do you they make them that way on purpose?

"
Betty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I absolutely love my iWatch - I do wish the charge would last longer. I had a Fitbit before and it only needed to be charged once every 5-6 days. With the iWatch, it only lasts about 24 hours. But - I love that I can call someone if I fall and can't reach my iPhone (which actually happened before I bought the iWatch).
"
Jennifer N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My watch is fine. Works as it’s designed. It was Xmas gift to myself.  I had a cheaper watch before that I charged every 3 days. I have to realize this does more so I have to charge it about every 20-30 hrs. What I’m grateful for was reading the reviews that told me I needed a usb-c charging block so I ordered that with the watch.

  This is my first ever Apple product, and I am floored by the performance it has given me. I am a 5th-year Graphic Design student, and I was originally using a Microsoft Surface Pro, and the conversion to Mac was a MASSIVE upgrade!!! Especially with the use of the M1 chip. I'm able to produce videos using Adobe Software, which even on my Gaming WIndows PC, uses quite a large amount of RAM  and VRAM to render out, only use half of that with this laptop. Added in a 1TB SSD External and a Dock, and I am a happy man!!! Thank you, Apple!

  This is a great product it’s definitely an upgrade in audio quality. I’m not to hyped about the new pinch controls instead of tap controls. The shorter stems are great I can lay on my side with em in and have very little trouble. The special and head tracker audio choices are crazy the mess with your head but in a good way it’s hard to explain. I already got them wet and they work fine so the new water resistance does work for sure.,Good quality do suggest
"
Clint,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these because of the waterproof features, being able to click the actual airpod to pause music or answer calls, the better angle, etc. All of these features are awesome... Sound seems the same, battery life a little better...,BUT (BIG BUT) I have normal sized ear canals/cavities and these are WAY BIGGER than the first gen. These are so BIG that they hurt my ears (a lot) and would eventually wiggle loose and fall out. I imagine if you have larger ears, these will be ok.,***APPLE, please make the original airpods with the new features PLEASE!!!***,Or make these with a smaller head......?
"
AmCas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am a daily user of the OG AirPods- i work outside so a good 7 hours every day, in all weather. I never tried the 2nd gen because I hate the rubber inserts. So when I saw these and the shorter stick I was super excited!! However, for me, they do not fit in my ears like the OGs do. I get em in but they just are not secure and are uncomfortable and fall out. Plus I hate the “pinching” controls!!! For several months I wear hats/hoods/gloves. It’s impossible to even answer a call!! Finding the sticks with gloves on under layers is not possible. With the OGs I can tap it thru hat+hood+gloves with no prob!! I’m returning these and going back to my originals. The ONLY good thing I noticed is the improved battery life….

  The Apple Airpods (3rd Generation) are the best Airpods Apple has made.  I purchased these for my niece as a Christmas present.  She told me that the sound quality and the bass is way better than the Airpods (2nd Generation).  She also told me that she likes the fact that these do not seal so tightly in her ears so they are a lot more comfortable to wear, and they still stay in her ears.  I like that they don't go inside the ear canal as this should help reduce the possibility of damage to her ears. She also said they are not as heavy, and the battery life is really good.
"
CMBT MDC,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I didn't open the box or break the seal, but I was NOT able to register the AirPods or add an Apple Care+ Warranty plan. Apple couldn't recognize the serial number. The box looked exactly like the one that my wife recently purchased from Best Buy, but her serial number is recognized in the Apple system. I returned the item and going back to Best Buy to spend a few dollars more to get a genuine Apple product.,I also noticed today when I bought some at my local Best Buy. The AirPods that were sent to me via Amazon did NOT have the clear wrap on it.
"
Robert F,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had a set of the first generation AirPods, and they fit my ear perfectly. I purchased the 3rd generation as a replacement (battery issue). First, they are much larger in your ear than the first generation. I don’t find them uncomfortable, but they don’t fit as far into my ear canal as the previous set. As a result, more outside noise gets in. They are great unless you have background noise. As for the sound, I find the overall quality of this pair better than the first. The full dynamic range is more crisp/clear and these make the first generation sound a little muddy. The primary reason I didn’t give 5 stars is since they don’t fit as snug, background noise gets in the way. Also, I have to push them in from time to time while moving around so they don’t fall out (never an issue with the first generation). Time will tell on battery life, but for now it’s great. I haven’t had a good use for the spatial audio yet, but it does work well. I expect gaming would be the best use.
"
Simon Waxman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The 3rd generation Apple Airpods are a major disappointment. The principal issue is that they are designed to lie limply on your earlobe rather than in the ear canal, as other earbuds are. The Airpods provide NO SOUND ISOLATION at all. None. Zilch. The result is that you can't hear anything coming out of these earbuds unless you're sitting in a quiet room, which is not what earbuds are for. Their purpose lies in their portability. Yet a soft breeze, to say nothing of city traffic or a subway ride, will overwhelm the audio from these cans. What's the point of headphones you can't hear? Good question.,When I listened in a quiet room just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, I found the audio quality decent, slightly improved over that off my other off-brand earbuds. But those cost one-third the price of the AirPods. (Oh, and they have sound isolation.) I should be getting much better audio quality at this price. Instead Apple has done what all the non-audio companies selling headphones are doing: boosting the bass and forgetting everything else. Listeners are too checked out to notice or care what they're hearing; all they can detect is bass. That's why every new product made by any company that isn't Bose, Sennheiser, or one of the other legacy brands is bass-forward. It's marketing, not sound. As a musician and careful listener, I'm the opposite of impressed.,I give the Airpods credit for superior internal mic'ing, which allows you to place calls more effectively than with other earbuds. My interlocutor was able to hear me relatively clearly using these earbuds, an improvement over the competition. There were still issues of wind noise and that ""far-away"" sound, however. Interference and distance are unavoidable with earbud mics, but some do better than others when it comes to filtering and signal processing in order to overcome environmental effects, and the Airpods do shine here.,The Airpods also pair seamlessly with my iPhone, the first time and every time. But this isn't anything to celebrate. It simply clarifies that Apple is trying to force us to buy their overpriced, underperforming audio products by boxing out competitors. Such seamless pairing should be possible with other products as well, but instead Apple uses proprietary technologies that mar the usability of other brands. Imagine if, back in the day, Sony's Discman or Walkman was only compatible with Sony's headphones, and every other brand required an adapter. That is what's happening here; only the details of the tech are different. This seamlessness is not a feather in the Airpods' cap. It's a powerplay by Apple, earth's richest company, trying to squelch the competition--including competition from companies that actually want to do audio the right way.,On the whole the 3rd-gen Airpods are not only useless, they are an indictment of Apple's corporate practices and, worse, a reflection of the sorry state of consumer audio in the era of low-fi streaming. It should not be possible to sell a product this faulty at a price point this high. If you want low-end earbuds, you can get them for $19.99 at CVS. If you want to spend $170, you can get excellent headphones from an audio company. Yet here we are, buying low-end earbuds for $170 from Apple.,I have returned mine, of course, and you should too.

  Great improvement from previous AirPods. Battery life is much better. BUT I would not buy this from Amazon. I was sent a pair that was used, with a box that seemed resealed.
"
Christina ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered this product new, it came without the plastic covering, the tabs were pealed on the box, and there’s like fuzz/ dirty around where the tabs where pulled due to it being sticky from being pulled back. Im scared to open the box the rest of the way to see if the actually AirPods have been used. Not to mention I bought these as a gift.,Update: so the actual AirPods had plastic piece around them, so I assumed the AirPods themselves hadn’t been touched, I was wrong I pulled them out of the case, there was earwax on the inside of both AirPods, and dirt in the curves and when the phone recognized them they were already connected to someone named “Bella’s” iCloud. Super disappointed cause as I stated prior these where supposed to be a Valentines Day gift. I’ve never had an issue like this on Amazon where you purchase something NEW and a seller sends you a used product.,Returning them, I recommend purchasing electronics from an actual retail store, or even online through a retailer don’t waste your time or money.

electron,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Apple AirPods Max are everything you may have already heard. They’re fantastic and also wildly overpriced.,The design and build are fantastic. They look and feel significantly more expensive than my Bose. Drawing inspiration from both aviation headsets and recording studio units from the 50s, Apple has come up with a really iconic look. The Max is definitely heavier than the Bose I have but by no means intrinsically “heavy”.,The fit is good and AirPods are comfortable but it did take me some time to find the right position for me. Noise canceling is superior and invisible compared to any other type I have used. Apple has done well to avoid much ofthat sort of synthetic silence or hiss you get from noise cancelling. Passive mode is great and these work well talking on the phone also. The battery life is good and the two buttons on he right cup feel and work great.,Sound quality is excellent as expected with any ,used I have played, again leaning toward natural sound rather than boosted or over boosted bass levels. The Max excels greatly pairs to an Apple TV watching movies.,What isn’t so good?  They’re too hot to wear for workouts. I prefer something to let my ears breathe more when I’m exercising, so in-ear options may be a better choice. The case is a joke but not totally useless. The problem is while the case does protect the aluminum cups, it isn’t well made and does nothing to protect the comparatively more fragile parts of the earphones. No charger? No problem as have a  box full of USB and USB-C chargers already. Another small qualm is because of the case material, when you first unbox the Max, there is a very strong and unpleasant polymer type odor, but it goes away quickly.,Finally the biggest problem: the price. I think $350-400 is more reasonable. I had extra money I could afford to spend but I just don’t think $550 is realistic.  Apple aims to get you to spend as much as they can and from what I can see of demand and my own spending, they are winning people over.  Undoubtedly a cheaper variant will appear eventually and you may do better for your pocket book to wait it out.,I love these things. I won’t part with them. But they also cost too much. Your mileage may vary.

  Great Sound Cancellation, Sound Quality and Fidelity, but completely stopped functioning after less than 3 weeks of moderate use two times over.,This happened with one pair, it started cutting out, then wouldn't turn on at all. Resetting to factory conditions and other troubleshooting did nothing to fix it, and then it wouldn't even initiate the reset process when prompted.,After making a request, they replaced it in a timely manner, which was appreciated, but then it happened again with the replacement pair after even less usage time. All while I was taking extra care to avoid all potential hazards and made sure to use it for even shorter periods than I had for the first pair. So I'm not convinced that it was the result of a mere fluke.,It was a great product, with great Bluetooth signal range, noise cancellation, and sound quality. It was even somewhat distressing to no longer have the blissful quiet they provided on demand. It would be well worth the price if it wasn't prone to breaking for no discernible reason within a month.
"
USAUSA,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I will be comparing the APM with the Sony XM4's as I purchased and used both side-by-side.,The APM have incredible active noise cancellation (tested with airplane white noise on YouTube) and their transparency mode is incredible. I give them the edge on both fronts compared to the Sony's. I also think the handoff between multiple Apple devices is superior to the Sony's which can only pair to two devices at the same time. I also feel there is potential in the magnet APM cups that can be changed as desired. If you don't like the ones that come with the APM you could potentially purchase a 3rd party option of a different material.,I prefer the Sony's for sound quality. You can tweak the EQ to your liking with their app. With the APM you are stuck with their default sound signature or the terrible presets in iOS settings. The default APM sound is good but leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Sony's which literally lets you tweak it to how your ears desire. I am a bass-head and the APM bass simply lacking for rap and pop music (to my ears).,While I think the concept of the APM physical controls for volume and track selection is superior to Sony's touch controls for the same, the placement of these buttons on the top of the right cup is baffling. I'm confident most people are like myself and like to adjust their headphones by gripping the top and bottom of their respective ear cups. By doing so you will inevitably press on these buttons. The Sony's have two buttons located on the bottom side edge (on/off and a custom button that by defaults lets you toggle modes). Far better placement.,The 'smart case' is actually nothing but a sleeve that is rather ridiculous as it's required to properly turn off the headphones entirely. Why Apple opted for no on/off button is beyond me. The APM come with no cable to connect to airplane entertainment systems, no travel case, no ability to fold into a more compact size, and no charging brick. A $550 set of headphones should include a charging brick and nice travel case, don't you think??,The Sony's meanwhile have all the cables you could possibly need, fold into a compact size, and comes with a lovely hardshell case. It doesn't have a charging brick but it's also far less expensive compared to the APM.,Ah yes, price. At retail the APM are $550 and while the Sony's retail for $350, they can often be found brand new for $280, literally half the price.,So let's recap. APM have amazing ANC, transparency mode, mic for phone calls, the ability to swap out the ear cups, and flawlessly work with multiple Apple products.,The Sony's allow you to tweak the sound to your liking, are more comfortable by far to wear, an on/off button plus superior button placement, a hardshell case, fold into a compact size, include the necessary cables for travel, and cost half as much as the APM.

Brandon S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had to think long and hard before spending $549 on over-ear headphones. I tried Beats, SONY XM4, and now AirPods Max. Beats were too heavy on the base, and SONY XM4 plastic design creaked too much when I would move my head, ruining the experience. AirPods Max premium build quality do not creak whatsoever, and offer the best sound quality of any headphone I've ever owned.,As for the $549 price tag... Apple are competing with professional headphones that cost upwards of $1000 (you can buy professional headphones that are easily $3000). In essence, you're getting the sound quality of a professional multi-thousand dollar headphone, for anywhere between one-half and one-fourth the price.,NOTE: if you do not have an iPhone, I'd recommend NOT buying these headphones, since you won't get all the benefits AirPods Max have to offer. If you JUST care about sound quality, and not spatial audio etc., and you why've an android, then by all means go ahead and pick these up.

Thelonious,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ok, I splurged on this. It was an impulse buy after I got my tax refund, I’m not gonna lie. My beats were all beat up, (I swear they make those things out spit and rubber bands), so I went for the next level “bougie” headset. I have to say, I’m NOT disappointed. The noise canceling is uncanny, I mean it’s magic! I’ve used the Bose flagship noise canceling headphones (forget the model name) and these are superior by far. The sound is also impressive, not quite as bass heavy as the Beat series, but way more balanced with more clarity + depth. The build quality is tight, not flimsy, and may actually hold up after a year or two of regular use (imagine that?) Also, I’m all Apple everything, so connectivity is a breeze.,Are they worth $500+ ? Meh… you can probably go much cheaper and get something comparable. But looking like a baller while sitting in economy plus, exit row with rose gold colored cans on your head? priceless…

Gary,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After reading all the criticism of the included case, I was surprised to find that I really liked it. It's a well-designed, compact, silicone enclosure that you can slip the phones in and out of with ease. It even feels good to the touch. So, I suggest withholding judgement about the case until you try it.,Yes, the sound is fantastic. Best I've ever heard from headphones. Definite upgrade from my Bose QC 35's. Pretty heavy but very comfortable. I love the controls. Volume control is a knob you turn. Noise cancellation is amazingly good and easily controlled with another little knob, when you need to hear something in the real world.,If you have other Apple devices, the headphones pair with all of them when you sign on to one of them. After that, they just switch quietly, automatically, on their own, to whichever device you are using.,The charging input is Lightning and like the newest iPhones, the AirPods Max do not ship with a charger, but that's no big deal.  You can plug them into any Apple charger you already have or any charging USB outlet, for that matter, using the appropriate connector cable. They ship with a Lightning to USB-C cable which I use it to charge off the USB-C charger that came with my iPad Pro. There's no lady announcing battery levels, as with Bose phones--you must use battery readouts on your device. I use the large battery widget on my iPhone.

   Well I’m an Apple fanboy and I love their products. I’ve been waiting for a long time to purchase this Airpods Max cause Amazon has a great discount this Black Friday.,The sound quality is way better than my Beats Studio 3. It’s lightweight and very comfortable to wear. The noise cancellation is great.  And on top on that, it sync to all of my apple devices automatically just like the Airpods Pro.,Love it

  i was so ready to return it primarily because it’s just way too expensive despite how seamless it connects to all my apple products. until i decided to watch something on apple tv, in this case “ice age” and used this headphones instead of my tv speaker. my jaw dropped. i was mind-blown! with spatial audio it felt like i was in a movie theater. it’s insane! absolutely amazed by what it could do. it was so immersive much more than when i was listening to music. of course, i ended up not returning it.
"
LLOD,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The good:,Headphones sound great. Pretty accurate, decent clarity, but a little lacking in the bass (for my taste). They're super comfortable, look good, feel good, and the sound cancelling is great. They obviously work well with apple devices (which as with most somewhat lacking apple products is a big selling point). Nice feature for the replaceable ear cups. Overall, a good listening experience.,The bad:,Price is pretty high - but somewhat in-line with similar quality and sounding headphones in their class. The 'case' is absolutely stupid, and mind-bogglingly horrible. It's unfortunate that the headphones don't collapse to a more travel-friendly form factor. As with many Apple Products the over-simplification of the headphones is a little meh - it'd be nice to actually be able to turn them off.  Charging a modern product with a lightning cable is so dumb, it's a port that should have died years ago. For a set of expensive headphones that should last a long time - they should have went with usb-c for sure - and having wireless charging would be good. Everyone has been speculating the iPhone (the last remaining device that uses the antiquated port) would ditch the lightning port for years now. If the iPhone finally ditches it next year, then these headphones will be the only thing that anyone has with that stupid cable. Macbooks, iPads, and every other current tech product in the universe uses usb-c, so it'd be great to only have to lug around a single cable.
"
Brian T,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love music ... and I love headphones almost as much.  I won't say how many pairs I have, but rest assured the number is high.  Long story short, the AirPods Max are far and away my favorite.  I've used them consistently since the day they arrived.  I was impressed on day one and am still impressed months later.  The sound quality and noise cancellation are both incredible.  Beyond that Apple has incorporated some great features.,Having said that, I have two complaints.  The first is the case - it's a joke.  If you plan to travel with these headphones you really need to purchase a different case that actually offers a bit of protection.  Second, the headphones don't come with the required accessories.  I'm specifically referring to the power adaptor and 3.5mm cord.  Both have to be purchased separately which is kind of crazy at the price Apple is charging for these headphones.  These two items are definitely disappointing, but they're not necessarily deal-breakers.,If you can get past these oddities the headphones themselves are amazing and have proven to be a real winner.  I remain extremely satisfied and would buy them again given the opportunity.

  Great device. The battery life is outstanding. The speed is surprising. The speakers are better than usable, they’re enjoyable to use. They only things I think I don’t like are the fingerprint scanner and the aspect ratio of the screen. I’ve mostly used cheaper android tablets before getting this tablet, so any comparison to android would not be fair. When I say cheaper, I mean just over the $200 range. That is why my expectations were a bit lower going into this one as well. They tended to have a nice screen but would be laggy and the speakers would be almost useless. This iPad stands out in stark contrast.,Oh, another con is that there seems to be no oleophobic coating on the screen. It holds fingerprints like a magnet. Cameras are also not good, but I tend to not use them, so they don’t bother me.

  Ok, I’ve had the new iPad Air 4 less than 24 hours, but it’s awesome. The size is slightly larger, but it really makes a difference. The audio is fantastic for streaming music and movies. Can’t really say about battery life as I haven’t used that much so far, but it charges quickly. If you’re interested in an upgrade Air 4 will be enough to stream, play casual games, and internet searches. It is compatible with 2nd generation Apple pen and keyboard. However I haven’t invested in either one yet. May not be the most helpful review, but it is enthusiastic.

  I Don't recommend for people that like to use headphones with their iPad. Disappointed and will be returning. I heard awhile ago that people were having trouble with the new iPad and listening through headphones with cords. The sound will just come over the iPad speakers whether you have headphones plugged in or not. I assumed by now apple would have fixed the problem. But Nope. It seems they could care less and will just take your money. I do not care for blue tooth headphones as the quality is never as good and I need it for mixing music. The whole reason I purchased this iPad was to do music, but if the headphone jack won't work, it's of no use to me. I will not be spending another $200 on wireless headphones that I don't care for. It seems the only way to get our message through to apple is toJust keep returning their products until they do fix it!,Get it together apple and fix your technology. Why do all your updates make everything worse?

  My previous iPad was a 1st generation Air and it functioned flawlessly. I have issues with this 4th generation iPad with the short battery life. Generally about 5-6 hours of general use. Secondly, this model uses the type-c port for charging and so my previous sets of cables are useless. Other than that, I do like the tablet and apple support. A personal disappointment is the swipe features that are too sensitive and totally distracting. I just want to disable that function altogether. I don’t like that I cannot interact with my aging late 2009 iMac. The iMac is absolutely awesome but even with i7 processor and best of what was available at the time of purchase Apple rendered it obsolete. Shame

  Either apple is making junk inferior products OR what the seller is giving you is not an actual 100% brand new apple ipad. It came with a 90 warranty and ONE month after it expired it is not working anymore at all. Can not get it to shutdown and only shows a plain white screen with small grids. Looked up troubleshooting online for that problem and apple recommendation is to bring it or ship it to them, costing ME almost as much as the ipad cost originally. I did so much research before picking this ipad air 4th gen and read all of the reviews for almost every seller and now I have nothing 4 months later and being a single mom cannot afford hundreds of dollars to fix sooooo just Beware.

  I upgraded to the iPad Air 4th generation from an Air 2 which just wasn’t able to run newer photo editing or music software. My focus is mostly on music and the Air 4 runs circles around the Air 2. Running multiple synths through GarageBand and Cubasis would choke the Air 2 at three or four virtual synths. I stopped at eight virtual synths and a dozen or so audio tracks on the Air four.,The stats are readily available so I’ll skip that and talk about features I like.,First, it’s nice to have USB C as I plan to use a drive to shuttle stems (audio tracks) to my music computer. Previously it involved using the cloud with an app and downloading from there. Doing it locally is vastly easier. I’d imagine photography and visual arts people would appreciate the choice.,The user interface literally feel better. Others have said they feel “one” with the glass and they aren’t lying. It is a unique feature and makes touch a more enjoyable experience.,The extra screen space is nice too.,The Air 4 is heavier and is thicker than the Air 2. To me, it feels more substantial.,I purchased an inexpensive case/keyboard and it enhances the experience. Again, this is an individual’s choice. The one I purchased has an magnetic keybed that is detachable. This is good because it allows for easier use of portrait constrained apps. If the cost of Apple’s cases weren’t substantially more expensive $150 - $350 I might have considered it but with the combined cost we are in computer or Chromebook territory.,If you use other Apple devices you probably don’t need to be talked into purchasing a new iPad. I spent a few days looking at what was available and honestly, the Air 4 is a good value for what it does and the ever expanding App Library which is a very strong sales point. My Air 2 is still useful. I’m typing on it now. It is my social media/internet tablet. I’ve been using it many years with virtually no problem beyond wear and tear I’ve put on it. It is a mid priced tablet, and I’m not saying it isn’t a substantial chunk of money, but comparing features it is more than competitive and Android still has a way to go to compete which isn’t a shot at Android or fans of it. For my needs the Air 4 is exactly what I hoped it would be.

  This iPad is great if you’re willing to spend more money. Compared to the 9th generation iPad it is a nice upgrade. The speakers are on both sides instead of just one which makes watching videos much better. The screen resolution is pretty much the same but this iPad has a Liquid Retina display instead of just a Retina display but most people might not be able to tell the difference. There is 4gbs Of ram compared to the 3gbs in the 9th gen which makes this one better at saving apps in the background so you don’t need to reload them as much. The Touch ID in the power button is fast and accurate, I was a bit worried it wouldn’t be as good as the home button one but it is pretty much the same. If you care about cameras this iPad has a better back camera but a worse front camera compared to the 9th gen. This iPad has Bluetooth 5.0 instead of 4.2 like the 9th gen this makes it better if you’re going to use multiple Bluetooth devices like a keyboard and earbuds. The A14 chip is very fast and can handle pretty much everything you would want to do. The display is also laminated so it is better for drawing. Overall it is a really good device, I mainly use it for school and entertainment and it has worked well. The multitask feature is very good and it does not slow down at all when using it.

  It does not come with a charger plug, you will have to spend extra money to add a plug meanwhile if you didn’t buy at the same time as the watch you will not be able to charge it with any other apple charger that you might have at home. It is different.

  If you owned an iPad, mini or air before then you're not going to notice the Jelly scrolling. Only if you're downgrading from an iPad Pro with 120hz pro-motion will notice this. The screen didn't get any worse than previous iPads, if anything it's a bit better. The only issue I have with it is that they decided to keep the base model starting with 64GB storage instead of 128 or at least give you the option to choose the 128GB model.

  These headphones are amazing, sound quality is great and seamless connection with iPhone iPad Apple TV and mac. The spatial sound is great but wouldn’t use it regularly.

"
Amber,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Arrived without the plastic cling film wrap, which meant someone used it and returned it. I was apprehensive about keeping them for this reason but cleaned them with rubbing alcohol and tried them on. I was debating between these and the AirPods Pro. I decided to return these because the Pros were better sounding, packaged better, and more comfortable.
"
SM,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the original AirPods when they first came out and used to go to the gym and run with those. Granted you would have to push them in every now and then, but these new ones are so much worse. They have a slanted design that goes into your ears and they fall out almost every few minutes. You don't feel confident with these on at all, even when you are standing or sitting. And the sound quality is no different than the first generation ones. In fact, I think it just has less bass, which isn't ideal. Apple has really gone down hill lately. Their products just aren't that great.
"
Melinda K,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The shape of the AirPods are a little uncomfortable and after only 2 weeks from receiving them the left AirPod starting to make a crackling noise as if the speaker was blown. Was never used over half volume and never dropped. I was able to get a replacement but my hopes aren’t too high on the quality. Sound was great, while it lasted. I decided to upgrade after using the generation 2 AirPods for a year. I work outside on equipment so they are used anywhere from 4-10 hours a day. I still prefer the generation 2 AirPods that have held up very well considering what I put them through. Also don’t like they went away with being able to customize one AirPods to pause and the other to change music. So far what these offer does not match the price tag.
"
LittleMissSunshine,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Got a pair of these Gen3 for each of my 20/21 sons and they HATE HATE HATE them!!!  Much fatter design n more awkward in the ears and fall out CONSTANTLY!  So pissed that I spent the money when I just could have gotten new Gen2s instead. Can’t comment on sound quality bc they don’t stay in the ears long enough to use them. Fail.
"
Bree,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What I like most about these are the size. The weight is different than with the AirPods Pro and the 2nd generation. My issue with headphones are they slip out super easily. These actually stay in my ear and I can jump up and down and they won’t fall out. These are definitely worth the money to me.,So far the only issue I have is when I eat something they fall out. Which isn’t a bad thing.
"
Riley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is in comparison to my 1st gen AirPods.,Pros:,Better looking in ear,Way better sound quality,Great battery life,Cons:,A little uncomfortable after a long period of time.,I’m not a fan of the “pinch” features vs the tap features the previous models had.,I bought these specifically because I did not want the noise cancellation. Solid 4/5 just because they do feel a little uncomfortable after having them in for a while. They fit a lot different than the 1st gens. The best way to explain it is they kind of sit in your ear as opposed to going inside of your ear.,If you have smaller ears these definitely will not fit you and will be extremely uncomfortable for you. I’d stick with the pros or the older model.
"
Pick a Name,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had my first gen AirPods for 3 years, using them almost daily. LOVE them.  Battery is depleting now which is to be expected.  Only last about 1.5 hours now instead of 5 hours.  Was excited about these new AirPods and the shorter sticks so ordered them.  Apple reconfigured these apparently to work with more people’s ears.  But now they don’t fit me.  :(. They are too big.  Fell out on first time use.  If I jam them into my ears, they may hold for 10-15 minutes and start falling out again.,So if you’re in the category of people who could never used Apple earbuds, these may have been configured for you and I recommend trying them.  If the regular AirPods fit well, they may not work for you.,No question about quality, it’s the same (to me) good Apple quality for the last 10 or more years.,Good luck.

Dari,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The new airpods 3 compared to my old gen one airpods sound divine, especially the base. The spatial audio is really cool too, though I haven't found much use for it in daily podcast and video streaming unless I look for it specifically. As for the noise cancellation, don't buy these if you actually need this feature. The good thing is if you like listening to music in an office setting but still need to be aware of people talking to you occasionally, you will have no trouble hearing them while on low to mid volumes. Also the battery is amazing. I don't have to worry about charging the case for days while using them constantly for hours during that time.

   i am happy to be upgrading. i did research and found this product better as I go to the gym. With the second generation they aren't water resistant. Alhtough I have used them for year's I have always put them in rice.,Back to the review I love the spatial audio and the way they fit my ears. At first, it's weird since I'm used to my ancient airports, but nothing too bad. The only thing I do have to get used to is how you change the music on the AirPods. Two clicks to skip ahead and three to play the song back. If you're Siri is on you can just talk to her instantly. Glad I upgraded and got coverage💕👍🏽

  I paid a lot of money for this watch. It was packaged very nicely but it does not come with a charging cube to insert into the outlet. I have an Apple watch and cubes and none would work. So, I figured I must need a special cube just for an Apple watch.  Bought one for $24 on Amazon and it doesn't work either. So now I have spent additional money. My son-in-law came over and thought it could be charged on my computer but it could not. So, he has now ordered me another type of cube from Best Buy and hope this works. Have had this watch for almost 1 month and have yet to be able to charge it. Not happy

  All I can say it's really disappointing to buy and item like this and you can't use it because there is no way to charge it. Now imagine getting it as a gift and having to wait to use it until you buy another item (the power block) to charge it. That's like buying a TV without a power cord, or a new car that doesn't come with the FOB or key. I never liked Apple products because of the hassle, this just solidifies my belief that APPLE SUCKS.

  The audio quality on these is amazing, they look great, and the microphone reportedly sounds good, but...,* They are surprisingly heavy.  Unlike, say, the PLG Focus, you'll have difficulty wearing these for extended periods of time without fatigue, which is a problem if, like me, you bought them to work from home.,* The model I bought has software and hardware issues.  It won't reliably connect to, stay connected to, or switch between your iPhone, iMac, laptop, or iPad.  The button you press to switch between audio modes worked properly at first, but now won't respond.  Could be a first generation issue (something you didn't worry about with Apple hardware, once upon a time).,Would I buy it again?  Yes, based on one feature: a great microphone.  I've tried a dozen different premium headsets over the years, and this is the only one with which people I talk to on the phone consistently say sounds as good as speaking directly into my iPhone.,But I'd pay even more for a model that was lighter and less buggy.

  So I mainly purchased these to watch tv on my apple tv at night. I have a pair of the apple airpod pro's also. So which do I like the best. Unfortunately not these. The sound is not the best. I expect a lot for 500 plus dollars. These don't give the sound when listening to music that I want. They slip on my head constantly. The buttons on the top are constantly in the way. I am always touching them when I try to adjust the headphones. Which then turn things on or off. I made all the adjustments recommended by youtubers and they still don't have the sound of the airpod pro's. The case is stupid. There I said it. They should have not provided a case at all. It gives zero protection for these 500 dollar item. Also why should I purchase a hard case and other protection items for this. They should provide it since they charge so much for the item. Still not sure if I am going to send back or keep. I am leaning on returning them. I am just not impressed with this item. Also apple why should I research on how to use your items? think about giving directions for use.

TEKnight Rider,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've owned several headphones and before trying these AirPods Max, my favorite pair was the Bose Quiet Comport 35 II. These are simply phenomenal!!!,Price Wise...I've heard a people say the AirPods Max are so expensive, but are they really? I will expound.,Last I checked a person pretty much still gets what a person pays for....meaning the AirPod Max is the best and has even been compared to $800 Beoplay H9/H95 headphones in several reviews. So when compared to an $800 pair of headphones...then it's about value...where else can people by an $800 sounding headphone that is as classy for $465 to $550?,It's NEVER just one thing with Apple...it is about the quantitative all encompassing details that add up to even more and more value. Just like Steve used to say, Making things easy is hard...an that costs something. If a person cannot see the details, they don't have to buy it...no body is twisting anyone's arms. People buy because of two things, they either Trust you and/or your product, OR they see the Value in you and/or your product.,Anyway hope that might provoke some food for thought or perhaps a different perspective...and hope that this might help others out there. :-)

John,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ll start this by saying I also have the Sony WH1000-XM4’s, and these absolutely crush them in every aspect. I am selling my XM4’s after only a week of using the AirPods Max.,PROS:,Sound is subjective, but in my opinion these are far superior in sound quality to any wireless headphones I have ever tried. It’s bright, colorful, and has no distortion even at full volume. 10/10.,The noise cancellation is... unbelievable? I put them on and immediately sucked into space. I don’t know how they pulled it off. The transparency mode is also crazy, it really just sounds like you aren’t wearing them. Truly a marvel.,Battery life is good, lasts me two days of wearing them all day while I work. 20 hours feels accurate.,Just like the AirPods Pro, the Bluetooth is better than any I have tried. I can move through my entire apartment without losing connection, and the auto switching changes the game.,CONS:,The case is... terrible . Such a bad choice from Apple, and it’s pretty astounding since the rest of the headphones are the best and seem very well thought out. It’s hard to get them in and out of without bumping the cups together and making me afraid I will scratch them. It provides almost no protection for the headphones. I have elected to get a third party case that will put them in low power mode, but I am hoping Apple will address this in a software update and allow me to turn them off.,If you can deal with a poorly thought out case, get these. I have no regrets.
"
Rob,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I absolutely love these!! One note on sound, I am running the latest FW (3E756) and using the Headphone Accommodations setting on “balanced” mode and using an iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPad Pro with the latest os’s. I was on the hate train until I actually tried these and fell in love with the intensely immersive sound stage. The sound profile is perfect for me and for the first time in a long time, I actually get completely lost in the music. I’ve had very high end open back wired cans and much prefer the sound profile in these APM’s. Pure enjoyment!!,These are very comfortable for my ears and do not have any issues with the weight. I’ve had the sony mx4’s and for me, there is absolutely no comparison between the two. The APM’s are in a completely different ballpark in terms of both sound quality and build. Take a look at the tear down and comparison between the APM’s, the Sony’s and the Bose on ifixit.com.,The noise canceling and transparency modes are unmatched. Spatial audio is very cool and adds a new depth and experience. Apparently it will be available to use with all streaming services with iOS 15.,Highly recommended if you’re in the Apple ecosystem.
"
Colin S,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was excited to get the AirPods Max. And will say that the battery life was great. Noise cancellation was superb — tested them while running a table saw. And audio were top notch. Check. Check. Check.,However, I sent them back for two reasons. 1. The way the noise cancellation is tuned gave a subtle/weird sound effect. 2. (Most importantly) these things were uncomfortable - very heavy. As a result I think these guys were designed to really clamp on your head to stay put — causing more discomfort. That alone would cause me to not wear these in the long run — so back they went.,Bonus reason: for that price these things should come with a real case. The thing they came in was not up to par with Apple’s typical level of quality and feature expectations.,I’ll stick with my Harman Kardon headphones and hope the second gen is lighter and the case better.

bbookworm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I wish I tried these before spending $4,000 on a pair of Sennheiser HD800S headphones and an HDV 820 amp to drive them. the HD800S and hdv820 is arguably the world’s best headphone setup, but these Apple headphones sound just as good or better for most top 40 music. For classical, the Sennheiser has a slight edge, and they can get much louder than the AirPods. However if given the choice again I would have saved the $4k and only bought these Airpods. Before I bought the HD800S I tried every type of super premium headphones in search of the best ones. The HD800S was by far the most comfortable with the best sound, that is until I tried AirPods. They are equally if not slightly more comfortable and I’m not tethered to an amp.

  I purchased these with a stipend, so luckily I didn't have to pay out of pocket. Otherwise, I would've been satisfied with the Sony XM4's (especially when they're on sale for $250 at the time of writing this).,I had originally purchased all 3 of the major noise cancelling competitors to see which one I liked best. The Bose QC45's that just released were a major disappointment to me, getting distorted as the volume increased and lacking any character in the EQ profile. They were super light and comfortable, but didn't sound nearly as good as I was hoping. Those were returned.,I purchased the Sony XM4's and was very impressed. With punchy bass and clean delivery of vocals and high end details, for the price, I definitely wouldn't regret buying those out of pocket. Even then, there wasn't as much detail and I still found myself wishing something else was there to wow me.,I put the AirPods Max on, and I was BLOWN AWAY. The quality of sound out of a bluetooth, noise cancelling pair of headphones was incredible. I had heard things in songs I've listened to for years that I'd never noticed before. Everything is perfectly balanced, nothing is overpowering or muddy. I was hoping to have the best of both hifi headphones with the convenience of a bluetooth set, and I think this is as close as I can get.,The one thing that is the most annoying is the wired solution, which doesn't even work if the headphones die. As a video editor, this is beyond frustrating.,Other than that, I will continue to proudly consider myself an Apple fanboy, and one who is suckered into spending money on good marketing and beautifully designed products.

  I have Sony and Bose headphones and to me these are more balanced than either the XM4 and the QC35. Are they perfect? No. Are they worth the $500+? No. I would easily recommend these if they were priced around the Sony’s and Bose’s headphones which are these biggest competitors. Pros and cons time!,Pros:,Balanced sound,Metal construction,Physical buttons for controls,Stylish,Comfortable,One of the best ANC on the market,Good microphones for phone calls and video chat,Pairs flawlessly with your Apple products,Cons:,The price,Can be a little heavy due to the metal casing,The “headphone case”,No off button,No charging mount,Lightning port,As you can see, the pros out way the cons. In my opinion, I can’t justify the price. I even bought these when they were $50 off. I think the biggest issue people are going to have is the “case” and no power button.,The headphones will go into sleep mode to conserve power. In order to do that, you have to put these in the case that doesn’t offer much protection. However, this also allows the headphones to easily connect to whatever Apple device you have then paired to when you’re ready to use them. If you want to take these for traveling you will have to buy a third party case.,With that said, these are my favorite set of headphones. This is coming from a long time Bose fan. They sound absolutely fantastic. I use them all the time at home for music and videos. The metal casing makes them durable. The trade off being they can be heavy, and will take some time to get use to.,Physical buttons makes these superior to other headphones out there with touch controls. You have two buttons. The Digital Crown which controls the volume and play and stop. The second button controls the ANC. The noice cancel on these are also fantastic. It cancel out most sounds. They do have some issues canceling out high pitched noises like a blender. With that said, they do tone down those higher frequencies.,It’s just a shame these are so expensive. I’d recommend them if you have the money to spend and are a big Apple fan. If you don’t have the money the. Sony’s XM4 and Bose’s QC35 are great alternatives.

BMan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Since I mostly work from home and listen to music when I'm not on the phone I use several bluetooth ear pods including AirPod Pros.,The Max version has always intrigued me but I have quite a few over ear headphones so until they went on sale there was nothing compelling me to purchase them.,I've had them long enough to break in the drivers to some degree.  Yes like most dynamic headphones these need to be broken in for 20 to 50 hours before they can be judged for sound quality.,1.  I'm a headphone guy so sound quality is my first priority.  This is an excellent headphone.  They blow away my bluetooth Sennheisers on sound quality.  They even compete with some wired headphones.  They may not reach the level of my Grado 325's but they are much more comfortable.  My Focal Clears, which incidentally match well with the output voltage of my iPhone, are superior but are much more expensive.  And wired.  BTW you can't get Lossless audio through Bluetooth so a wired headphone has that advantage.  And you can't talk through the Clears.  My wired Sennheisers don't really have the output levels to match an iPhone so they are not in the consideration.  These have a wide range sonically and reproduce all kinds of music well.  And unlike some Beats models they are not bass heavy.  I think they work best with Spatial Audio off.  iMy only complaint is that the midlevel sound stage is a bit compressed regardless of volume.  Apple did their home work in designing these headphones.  I'd go so far to say that you will not find another headphone wired or not that has as good as sound for the money.,2.  Comfort/Fit.  One goes with the other.  The head band is comfortable for my large head and does not squeeze my ears.  The ear pad material is not what I'd like but it is surprisingly comfortable.  Typical of any headphones they are best used without glasses for maximum comfortable. If you use glasses put the pads on your ears with the glasses on for maximum comfort.  I do not notice any weight - these are much lighter than most wired headphones.  The ear space fits my large ears although ideally a couple of extra mm's would be better.,3.  They connect easily once you go through the initial connection procedure.  Most importantly they have excellent battery life.  They have double or more battery life than Pros.  Put them in the case when you are through with them for the day as it is the only way they turn off.  You will otherwise lose battery life as they are otherwise constantly scanning for possible bluetooth targets.  The case is not great but it works well for being put into a bag or backpack.  Generally they do a good job of picking up your voice in telephone or FaceTime mode.,4.  They are an excellent value.  Usually a substantial discount means that there is a newer model is coming out.  My research suggests that is not the case.  There is likely to be a newer model of the Pros coming out which explains their greater discount.,I am very pleased with these headphones and I think that you will be equally as pleased.

T. J.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded to these after my dog ate my old ones, and I don’t like in-ear buds, so my comparison is between these and gen 2.,Pros: sound quality, sound adjustment with video (I’m sure there’s a term for it, but I’m talking about how it sounds like the noise is coming from behind you if you face away from your device—that blew my mind),Cons: I can’t get them to fit in my ear comfortably, like they’re too large or misshapen and always feel like they’re going to fall out. Despite the improvements, the discomfort was too much, and I bought a new gen 2 pair about 3 weeks after buying these.
"
Rw,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got my AirPod's yesterday in the mail love how they feel comfortable in your ears, and the cool features that they offer is pretty cool. I was at work listing to music with the right AirPod in my ear while walking around work my phone kept going off, with a notification ""Find My phone"" which I had no clue why it kept going off? Until I open my phone with my work address displaying saying that I left m airpod behind. That's so cool which will help me find them if I ever loose them or if someone try's to steal them.
"
Brad Cookson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I used to have the airpod pros but after my right airpod began to frequently not charge I decided to get a new pair. When I looked I found myself surprised to see airpod 3rd generations so I figured why not give them a try.,I have found that so far they are much less snug than my pros were and have hardly even close to the noise canceling ability of them, but they do sound good and I got some ear loops to fix the fall out problem.,I think they aren’t a bad update from the pros or 2nd gens if you’re a die hard AirPods fan
"
Sophie Summers,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded from AirPods second generation because they stopped charging.

They fall out super easy for me.,However the battery life is great and I don’t have any connection issues across my phone and MacBooks so that a plus.,I wouldn’t ever run or workout with these because of the fit but they are ok for working.
"
Automation Wizard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have used these headphones for several weeks now and I really like them. They sound great, the battery last a really long time, and they will read you an incoming text from an iPhone and tell you who is calling. My only complaint is they are a little big for my ears and sometimes fall out when I working but when one of them falls out the music or audio book will stop playing so you know one of them fell out. I have had many apple products and have only had one that let me down. I can’t complain.
"
Zach,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First things first, these are 100% the real things. Bought mine brand new and the packaging was fine. Not sure what was wrong with everyone else’s. I guess Amazon hates you.,Look and features : 10/10,By far these are my favorite looking AirPods. Didn’t quite like the longer stems on the Gen1 and Gen2s but I love the stems on these. I really like the squeeze to skip/play instead of the tapping on the older models. Leads to much more purposeful actions. The water and sweat resistance is nice as well. Dropped one in the snow and still worked fine. The new case is about the size as the older ones and just disappears in your pocket. Wireless  charging is cool but I don’t have a wireless charger so can’t say much on it.,Sound: 7/10,These are definitely an upgrade in sound compared the the 1s and 2s. But doesn’t mean they’re perfect. The spatial audio feature is cool and all but gets annoying so I had it turned off. The base is alright for wireless earbuds. But…. The mids and highs not so much. Any song that has a lot of mids, you know, what most instruments are, they get this weird background buzz. It’s not super loud but it’s loud enough to annoying as all hell. They also don’t perfectly seal with your ears (I’ll get to that later) leading to noise bleed and mediocre noise cancellation.,Fit: 0/10,These things are huge. By no means do I have small ears, I would say they are average. But boy oh boy do these not fit. A few of my friends tried them and they don’t fit any of us. They are a pain to get in and once they’re in you cannot walk around. The movement is just too much for them and they fall out. Even sitting still these feel like they want to come out. If you have to use the small or medium sized tips on other earbuds DO NOT buy these. But, if you have freakishly large ears, still don’t buy them.,For an extra $20 ish buy the pros, trust me.
"
Velvin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this knowing exactly what it was capable of and not capable of as well as features it did not have. Sound quality could be better but works fine for casual music listening. Not as good as I hoped it would be for capturing my voice clearly for the other side to understand my speech well. Still fine. The biggest gripe I have is that these don’t fit my ears well and eventually pop out. I have not had this problem with gen 2 or the pro. Perhaps it’s just me. I may need to look for a silicone sleeve.
"
Ulysses V. Villasan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Airpods just falls off during an extensive exercise. Skin-detect sensor doesn't work for me. We should have an option to have either pods to turn off auto ear detection, not just in both of them. Everytime i take out one of my pods, music just pause and had to play it again. It just annoying in my opinion. Still preferred Airpods pro than this.
"
Alissa,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I wanted these AirPods for work so i can listen to music while I work. These were so terrible they didn’t fit in my ears, they kept falling out and hurt so bad when I would try to readjust them. Also these are supposed to be the “newest generation” but they don’t even have noise cancellation. These are just HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! Also they have absolutely no bass I even tried to change it in settings and it still did nothing at all.
"
Yosviel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don’t know why people say they fall easily from your ears because I previously bought the pro ones, but they were constantly falling from my ears, so I decided to try the AirPods 3rd generation. They don’t have noise cancellation, which is not a big deal for me, the sound is less sharp than the one on the pros but still not a huge difference worth paying way more. I am very happy with the fact that the AirPods 3 stay in my ears to the point that I forget they are even in it.

  Positive - great sound with high @  mids vocals very little bass/ -transparent mode @ great cancellation great watching movies on only apple devices - and with certain movies Thur apple and there very simple to hook up Thur Bluetooth connection - and controls on head phone very simple  - with voice prompt -and phone calls,Negatives - price way over the sound quality not very loud /no off and on has to be trigger / by a case looks like a purse or bra /you have to adjust the rods each time to put in case over time I figure ware and tare - very heavy and they  cause pain to ears due to the aluminum sides - the aluminum sides bump each other  wonder over time that they be scratch - make sure u have protected rubber silicone by 3rd sellers -the mash- top of band properly will tare on you over time - and as spoken compensation can happen if you go from hot to cold air temperature. - or even sweat. During walking or running  -@ working out ( apple knows this but they want you to wipe out cups each time - if you ears are lower -on head or a person that has a big head -it’s possible they won’t fully fit over the ears -even at max extension there not comfort on people wearing glasses also and if you have ringing in ears or wax build up in ears you will hear popping - cracking sound due to pressure of no cancellations /transparent modes -you really have to be gentle with these - like pins and needles gentle THIS IS MOSTLY A FASHION STATEMENT WITH THESE with the wow factor at first but with these. There mostly a indoor headphone,To compare quality - sound  Bose -Sony leading brands  sound just as good with higher volume @ 1/2 the price  Battery 12 -18 hours  base on volume/ and different modes  my honest opinion save your money look else ware - to many negatives for 450 -550 headphones

Earthling,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I admit, based on reviews, I expected these to sound magical. I wasn't blown away, though...to me, they sounded good, not amazing. It seemed like the mids were scooped, which is not my preference. Wish this was something I could tweak like other headphones out there. I also found the headphones did not have a high enough max volume..this was frustrating.  I think the design and build quality are superb, the tactile feel of the headphones is nice, and the iOS/MacOS integration is flawless. The headband is very comfortable, but the headphones are heavy, borderline too heavy, and a little too big for my small head..they felt a little loose when walking around the house. Ultimately, I decided to return the headphones. For me, it wasn't worth it for the high price.
"
R. S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have AirPods pros and Bose QC35s at home and I decided to get the AirPods Max, as the Pros have been wonderful. I have a iPhone, iPad, and MBP. All work wonderfully with both the Bose and the Pros. The Max has been a nightmare. Connecting it to the iPhone was seamless, just like AirPods and AirPods Pro, however the audio was dropping in and out multiple times over the first few hours with the MBP. I then took a call with them and the device kept dropping from the iPhone every few minutes. Multiple ""Can you hear me now"" statements and I switched back to the AirPods Pro and it worked just fine.,I have to believe I got a faulty device, but for the price, that's just unacceptable quality control. I returned them and will continue using my AirPods Pro and QC35s. Maybe will give the Max another chance in a future revision.
"
Steve,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great sound,quality and functionality. Could be a touch more comfortable, as the headrest need to be angled forward or backwards every once in a while to keep the cups from resting on ears at time, but this may just be my ear or headshape and may be able to be remedied in another way that I haven’t figured out yet. Ive only used them a couple of times, but mho is they are comfortable but the cups do rest a little on my ears from time to time and i slightly adjust and feels better.,I think these are probably the best headphones 🎧 you could get overall at this price range. They work for me and sound great👍🏼✌🏼
"
Jeff S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  To me this is just a meh. The only reason i would pick this over other bluetooth headphones is the built quality/aesthetics/ease of use.,My advice is to shop around for a much lesser price. 450 and under seems reasonable enough. I'm glad i didn't pay full price. With that said, I'm quite satisfied. Probably would've been disappointed if i paid 550.,Sound. This is good. Just good because at least it's clean. Bass is definitely thin imo. The preset EQ don't help. I personally have it at flat or off. Any other preset EQ distorts the over all quality of the sound. Ath m50btx is better in delivering all the frequency. (And if wired with dac/amp, then that's game over for the airpods max) over all the sound is likeable. The NC and passthrough is definitely the icing on this product.,Another advice. If you don't need the NC/passthrough or not really in deep in the ecosystem, you can probably get by with the competition brands. Senheiser, Sony, Bose and plenty more to choose from.,My review seems like I'm taking a jab at this product. Well, I'm not. I just don't want your expectations high. If you are somewhat a collector of headphones, this is a good addition. Just don't expect too much out of the sound. Everything else is a 5 stars though. My fav headphones/iem: isine10. Monolith m570. Beyerdynamic 80ohm. Ath m50xbt. Fidue a83.,I just remembered the battery. It sucks...! I haven't put it through the test, but i suspect this will not last 20 days even if you don't use it. It drains even in the bra case.,Well. I hope this somewhat gives you an idea.
"
Old bicyclist,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  You want audiophile quality sound without all the BS?  Buy these and forget about needing any more gear.  No cables, no amps, no A/D converters, no tower speakers, no subwoofers, nothing.  I own very high end systems with top-rated versions of all of the above and I can tell you that AirPods Max cans sound as good as anything you can buy. They have one small flaw (beside the stupid name) and that is that the included case/bikini underwear is pathetic and storing them elsewhere uncovers the fact that auto device switching is not perfect which can consequently cause them to lose charge when they keep turning on and off.  A good-old hardware on-off switch would be the solution.
"
Korawat,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound and the anc qualities are good. However, the product is not at all wearable. The clamping pressure is enormous, making it difficult to wear them all day. There is also no protective case for the product. You will have to buy a separate case for it even though you already paid $600.

  This review is very specific to my case, however, I felt as though others out there may face similar.  So here goes.,I wear glasses, and I hardly shave.  My stubbles make wearing the headphones a bit more scratchy feeling.  My Bose QC35 II's have that fake leather, and is more comfortable IMHO.  That wasn't the deal breaker, but what was, was my glasses.  I wear glasses every day and that they a bit wider to fit my face right.  Officially, they're 58x19X150mm.  With that said, I could never really get a good adjustment that felt comfortable to me.  It felt like the pressure was more towards the top part of the ear pieces.  I'd expand the headband to have the ear cups sit a bit lower and it be a bit better for a bit, but the pressure on my frames as well as the temple and temple tips was just too much.,Alas I've returned them.  The noise cancellation was quite a bit better than my Bose, as well as the Airpod Pros.  The sound quality was quite amazing, and I've come to now realize that my Bose are bass heavy, to which I'm not a fan of any longer.,Cheers!

  This is a beefy boy. But it carries the weight very well. It's more comfortable than leather headphones - probably because my ears don't sweat as bad.,I was really hoping to wear these all day every day because they really are so good - but the lack of water stops me from trying.,The Transparency mode is really transparent and almost perfected.,The ANC blocks out even the local crowded friday-night bar noise to a whimper.,Music quality is on point.,There is just one issue that I've run into that I never really ran into with any other headphones - condensation. After about an hour I found ""mist"" lining below the ear cups. For the breathable fabric, I surprised by this. I'm sure the engineers knew of the condensation being an issue since it's not leather - like every other headphone. Together with a lack of any water resistance, It's worrying to even wear these headphones.,Why the 1 star? The glaring design issue with water build up over time and no resistance to the water build up. I can't use these headphones at all. They're an expensive door stop.

  Apple once again demonstrates their total disdain for the consumer!  After waiting for the watch to finally arrive, SURPRISE!, Apple doesn't send the watch with a power block to allow you to charge the thing.  But wait, you can purchase one from Apple, for additional cost and then wait for that item to arrive.  I'm one customer waiting for the karma bus to roll all over Apple....

  Used as a watch and a fitness and health tracker.,Disappointed that the mobile apps are overpriced and require a monthly subscription. Also requires the the wireless Apple headphones and additional monthly data subscription added to phone bill to make full use of the product capabilities.

   I love the watch and capabilities. Make sure you’re running latest iOS. This will save on setup time. You will need a USB c adapter to plug the charging cable into as only the cable is included. Mobile access requires you to be the account owner on your cellular account. Not negatives, just information. Battery life is 8-10 hours.

  I was needing a tablet to for use at work, because I was tired of my slow laptop functions and my tiny iPod Touch for watching videos. It’s my very first tablet, and it’s gonna last a long time. It runs smooth with my Wi-Fi, and the battery life is something to behold. If one of the big reasons you bought an iPad was to watch non-purchased videos on it, the Videos app is not available. It’s now the Apple TV APP, and videos will show up in the downloaded videos column. I hope this helps.

  I already have the 2nd generation and wanted to try these for fit and they are just fine don’t know why I’ve been seeing folks complaining about it falling out maybe they are not placing them in correctly because there is a way to do it according to Apple the stems should be pushed towards your face but enter them in straight so it basically locks it in no problem also I really like the squeeze option a lot better than tapping cause I use to accidentally tap the others so I am extremely happy with the my new air pods….
"
Visualspatial,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Feels like boulders in my ears compared to Gen 2s. I'll get used to them but I plan to use my Gen 2s for EDC and keep these for online work as they are less obtrusive. My ears are too sensitive to wear my Pros much. If a smaller version comes out in future editions I'll sell these and upgrade.
"
tharp83,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These just don’t fit.  Maybe I have small ears, but no matter what fit videos I try to adjust them, they fall out as soon as I lean over.  Or sit down.  I’m CONSTANTLY having to tighten them or put them back in.  The 1st and 2nd generation fit me fine.  I could wear them all day and they wouldn’t fall out.  These fell out 10 times in the first 2 hours.  I will give them another day to see if I can figure out how to get them to fit but they are likely going back.
"
rachel pan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased a used AirPods 3rd generation,  the AirPods are in good shape as described, but when I try to connect it I found it still linked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apparently, the previous owner didn't remove it from the iCloud account before returning to Amazon and Amazon didn't check it before reselling it to customers. A Amazon associate I chatted with was funny, he told me to contact Apple (why? I have no idea, it is a Amazon problem not a Apple problem). But I did, I reached out to Apple customer service, Apple was not able to help because Amazon invoice didn't provide the serial number, I couldn't approve if that was a used AirPods I actually bought from Amazon. The other Amazon Customer service representative was good, she fully understood the issue, she refunded me the full amount and asked me to dispose the AirPods whatever I want.
"
Joyce Cross,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So far this is a nice product for me. It fits my ears very well. Sound is great. I can use it with multiple devices which I absolutely love. No having to disconnect from each one to work on different devices which makes it so good compared to other EarPods that require you to disconnect from each device and pair all over again. The charging thing is confusing because it shows 100% charged on the EarPods but charger very low charge even when both are on a charger at the same time. Maybe I’m doing something wrong? So far very happy with these.
"
Marty S,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely most uncomfortable things I’ve ever put in my ears. These things are bulbous to say the least. I put them in and within a few minutes my ears began to hurt. I took them back out, and a while later I tried again, adjusting the positioning. Well.. they still hurt. When I made any sort of facial expression they loosened up. After they hurt on my third try a while later I gave up. I have no idea why Apple would make these things so massive. I compared to my AirPods 2 and they seem to be twice the size. It works for some people but I’m so disappointed.
"
Mandy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m a an avid AirPods user, and LOVE them completely, I wear at least one most of the day and they never fall out of my ears or become uncomfortable, in fact I forget I’m even wearing them. I was excited to see the new features offered on the new AirPods 3 and I ordered a pair. Unfortunately the new design won’t stay in my ears, a problem I’ve never had with Apple earbuds or previous AirPods. So, I returned them and will be sticking with my AirPods 2 for now. I’m hesitant to try the AirPods Pro because I’ve had issues in the past with in-canal tips becoming painful, but I guess If I want the added features I may have to give in and try them. I think I might wait and see what the next generation of AirPods Pro are like though. If the newly designed shape will stay in your ears, they are awesome, and well worth purchasing. Good luck!
"
Ryan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased hoping these would be an upgrade to the Air Pod Pro - they weren't. I pulled them out of the box and immediately noticed they didn't have the rubber inner ear dealios which create a soft ear experience on the Pro's - searched the box and realized these don't have them at all. Also some features of the Pros these don't have. Would say if you have the Air Pod Pro to stick with them versus making the change to the 3. If you're new to these and the rubber deal isn't an issue for you, these are currently more affordable and a good entry versus the original Air Pods - otherwise would say spend the extra $30-$40 and just get the Pros.
"
Maria,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It is great; the sound is heaven to the ears since I upgraded from AirPods 1st gen. It really feels like I don’t have them in and the head tracked spatial audio, IMMACULATE! The battery life is amazing as well like around 6 hours straight (when fully charged). I do have a few problems. Sometimes they disconnect for absolute no reason and I would hear these shocks kind of malfunctioning within a couple of months once in a while of getting them which is weird. Other than that, a huge upgrade!
"
Jen S,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very disappointed, these would have to be worse than the wired earphones that used to come free with the iPhone. Definitely not for small ears, within minutes of being on my ear started to hurt from it pressing into the cartilage in my ear.,Every use there were odd artifacts in the sound, whether it be static or random chopping sounds. Plus the mic quality was like I was talking on a flip phone from 2001

Sparkkle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First of all, these sound FANTASTIC!! Way overpriced is what I thought initially but when I heard the sound (and noise cancellation) they are well above and beyond the less expensive Bluetooth headphones. Another big benefit is how easily they switch between and connect to distant Apple products (perfect if you have multiple).,The BIG DOWNSIDE,They make my head itch. Not sure what’s going on but I’ve had the Sony XM 3 for a couple years with no problem. These Apple ones make my head itchy within the first week and a couple of hours of wearing.,Additionally, they had a very strong chemical odor when you open the box, unlike any other Apple (or other brand) product I’ve ever purchased. It smelled like one of those cancer chemicals (I am forgetting the name right now). The smell did go away after a few days of airing them out.,However, my head still itches every time I wear it. I don’t have that problem with the Sony ones.,I am super bummed as the sound quality and ease of connectivity make these totally worth it. I hope Apple looks into this issue and see what is causing these chemical smells etc
"
Mike Harm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was skeptical that the AirPods Max were just another device that was the epitome of the ""Apple tax"" - A regular device that worked well enough, but was EXTRA expensive just due to fit/finish/materials and not really a differentiated experience.,Let me start by saying: I was WRONG.,The AirPods Max are BY FAR the best sounding headphones I've used (not withstanding professional studio monitors I've used that I'd NEVER use on the street). They are absolutely above the hype - They perform amazingly and integrate as flawlessly with my Apple devices as their more diminutive in-ear counterparts.,They're not only extremely well constructed, but have the best noise cancellation I've experienced - This is likely a combination of excellent ANC parameters and algorithms and great ear cushion design. Speaking of those cushions, they are the ONLY over-ear headphones I can wear all day and take seamless calls from!,Excellent apple integration, modular consumable parts (magnetically replaceable ear cushions should be a STANDARD on high-end cans!) and excellent performance mean these are now my go-to when using my Apple devices...
"
H. Spraggins,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these and they did not connect to my iphone automatically. After playing around with it they connected but it was intermittment. Then I put them on for a while and they felt heavy so I decided to return them. Had to talk with a supervisor and he said, ""Well you can *request a return but that doesn't mean you'll get a return."" No lies-- this is Amazon Customer Service. I am baffled. Things are changing.
"
Jared,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't know why apple, of all companies, can't figure out how to make ear cups that don't smash glasses into your head. These even have removable ear cups. So stupid, and so intensely uncomfortable. I know there are replacement ear cups that are supposed to be mildly better, but they make the sound worse. Why buy $600 headphones that need to be modified so they don't leave glasses imprints on your skull. The Sony's don't sound quite as good, but are half the price and can be worn comfortably with glasses for hours.
"
Kai Cherry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Real Talk - these are NOT ""Metal Beats Studios"" or whatever. These are 100% Apple. As such, they are designed and meant to be paired with Apple products. You do that, you are good to go.,What you do not get: A charger. It uses the same one your iPhone or any other Apple Lightening thing you may have does. It comes with a cable. Mine is still in the box; I just charge from my computer. Apparently, this is a problem. I don't get it :),What you DO get:,-  A *very* immersive, *very isolated* soundstage. The Noise Cancellation is so insane, it is near ""witchcraft"" levels. It's legit. :),- 'Super Hearing' with Transparency Mode: If you have used this with AirPods Pro and where like ""yeah, ok, this works""...this is more like ""Yeah. I can hear *everything* SUPER CLEARLY. Stop breathing so loud""-levels and the ""mix in"" is really balanced with audio you may be listening to.,- Spacial Audio on these things is hard to describe without sounding overly hyperbolic. The directionality is much more dialed in than the AP Pros, the ""behind you"" is really great. I wish it worked on my Mac tho. Maybe in the future.,The build on these is like...I have zero concern I will break them. Ever. I believe they could seriously injure someone if swung hard enough. Seriously.,A lot of time and testing was put into the mechanisms, resistance of sliding, the sockets for the ear cups that rotate, very smoothly, but also have a firm, strong spring action for grip against your head.,Now...there *is* a problem. If you wear glasses, they will start to irritate a little from pushing against the side of your head. it is not the ear cups, which are borderline pillows. it is the pressure/pressing of the arms of glasses into your head. Be aware of this.,Handoff works great, call quality is great, very nice audio sep, highs do not sound sibilant unless they *actually are*, the bass is clear, not ""muddy"" and you *will* be hearing what you've been missing with these, like other headphones in this range. That's the really cool thing about these; hearing 'ghost notes' you never had before, studio sounds, etc. These really bring that stuff out.,I am ambivalent about the case/'case' controversy. They don't, heh...these things don't need a case. Heh.,They are not inexpensive. They also...are not ""cheap"". There's a lot of ""sour grapes"" out there around these. They are indeed, at least twice as good as AirPod pros...so if you like those or the Beats sport  wireless earbuds...and like music and stuff...you'll enjoy them. If you have to ""save up"" for them...worth it.
"
J. Arthur,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Noise cancellation and noise play through is incredible. They have the best sound for Bluetooth headphones - only comparable to Bluetooth headphones costing $850 or more (I have listened to multiple examples). Good separation of instruments and could hear finer detail than my previous Beats headphones. Good audiophile headphones can cost more than $5,000 and also require equally expensive extra equipment to work and are tethered. For Bluetooth headphones, these have great sound and separation. I signed up for Apple Music which is recommended for these headphones giving you the full benefit of their capabilities for music. They work flawlessly in the Apple ecosystem going seamlessly from one device to another for example if you get a phone call and will automatically pause things like a YouTube video if you adjust the headphones or temporarily take them off. If you are using them for editing video then it is recommended that you purchase the $35 cord because Bluetooth gives a very slight delay when you are editing video. Lossless sounds really good but to get the full benefit of Lossless you need the cord and a DAC (digital audio converter).  The Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio work great without a cord and many of the apps for streaming like Apple TV, Disney and Paramount have spatial audio. Watching Picard was fantastic. I have a noisy air conditioner in my work room and it cuts it out completely making it easy to concentrate.
"
schmottie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had Bose headphones for years; great sound and very comfortable. I guess I kind of fell for the hype of Apple so I caved and bought a set of the AirPods Max. First, I’m really not impressed with the sound quality, especially the bass. Second, the location of the controls on the headphones is prone to accidental use when adjusting the position of the headphones. Third, they aren’t super-comfortable on the ears, which is where Bose shines. Last, I’m not sure what to say about the “case” other than I can’t decide if it looks like a purse or a bra. At least that made me laugh. I have not used them yet for a call, so that may sway my opinion. But, as of now, For $429, they are just ok.
"
Seth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I feel like I just moved from Standard Definition TV to HD. You can simply hear everything better; each instrument is more distinctive. I notice riffs that previously were just part of the background; I can hear a singer being close-mic’d; the pop of a drum or pluck of a string is more realistic. I don’t want to give false expectations, but at the same time, my music listening experience has genuinely, discernibly changed.,I upgraded from the Bang & Olufsen H8. It was an on-ear headphone, so the sound isolation is an extraordinary leap for me. My husband got annoyed within 5 minutes of me taking these out of the box, since he was talking and I couldn’t even tell. If you haven’t experienced Transparency Mode before, though, it’s the perfect antidote, when you want it.
"
SKalata,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am astonished by the sound quality and noise cancelling of these headphones. I've been in the Pro Audio industry for 30 years and have had access to all the best brands of sound equipment. I've never heard headphones that sound this good. The voicing of them is simply perfect in my opinion, any music or movies I listened to sounded better than anything else I've ever listened on.,I recently used them on a flight across the country and the noise cancelling pretty much took care of all the engine noise. Now I will not fly without them! Highly recommended!
"
Better service,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First pair had issues with the right side ~ loud swirling wind sound. Apple couldn’t fix it. I returned those and bought a pair on Amazon because they delivered faster. Second pair sucks for a completely different reason. They constantly drop Bluetooth connection. They randomly make a loud, deafening static noise. These SUCK. It’s a shame. I like the sound quality when it works but ‘when it works’ is not a phrase that should be used with $600 headphones. After these experiences, I made the mistake of buying a thrid pair. These stopped working after 1 month. Apple won't accept the return. THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!,What happened to Apple? They used to be consistently excellent. Now their products are hit and miss.

I use it for my runs, the phone feature when I’m driving, and the health app. The best feature is the find my iPhone. I use it daily and it saves me the time of logging into the app. I rate it 4.5/5 because of the fragile charger.

Renee’ Steele,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really enjoyed these overall. What really surprised me was the bass. I read it was pretty good but still hearing it surprised me. The bass was much deeper than I thought & it creates a very pleasing listening experience. The sound is clear, crisp and I don’t really have any issues on them on that part. Connection to my iPhone is seamless as expected, battery lasts as long as Apple said 6 hours. Actually it was a good bit longer when I tested it. My only issue is that your gonna have to wait for your ears to get used to them. I wore them & my ears weren’t completely comfortable with them for a time. But after some time I got used to them. So I recommend these overall.
"
Vicente G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The product itself is of quality. However, I’m not certain as to the reason why the PRICE of this particular item , the Apple iPod gen 3 kept on changing every day from same price as with the Apple stores nationwide to their price at $98 to $118 etc.. then the following day or two it will be higher than that if Apple store. It’s very frustrating!!! This is bit a bidding game. I’m familiar with supply and demand. But you took advantage of this situation because of the holidays. Now the iPod gen 3 is cheaper.
"
Albert St,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am plagued with losing or damaging of several Apple pods so I decided tu use ""Anti-lost"""" straps. With the series 3 pods. I paid for additional warranty which covers at least 1 loss I think.,With Series 3 pods the stem is much shorter than the Series 2 pod so the setting in the ear of the series 3 pod with Anti lost straps is impacted and fall out of the ear more frequently.,So my rating is not based on the quality of the series 3 pods but the problem not being able to use straps.
"
Jania,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I didn't care about sound cancellation bc I like to be aware of my surroundings so I found this to be a wonderful upgrade from first gen. Not the same shape, but still takes up as much space. They do hurt my ears after a while but any headphones do. They also do fall out a bit more than I'd like but that's just cause I don't like jamming them in my ears. I got them on sale so money well spent!
"
Jason Mulek,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the 1st gen Airpods and loved them.  Especially for phone conversations.  I was never ""wowed"" by the music quality but they were ""good not great"".,These Gen 3 versions are a massive upgrade in sound quality.  Much more bass, full sound.  Actually pretty amazing for in-ear models like this.,I am extremely happy I got these.  If you are upgrading from Gen 1, you are really going to love them.
"
J. King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Case is the charger, so keep it charged and makes it easy.  Case charge lasts about 1.5-2 weeks for me!  I store the pods in the case, so it works well.  Controlled the pods with taps was a little confusing at first.  I do like that you just tap on the pod to answer calls.  I work in dog daycare and dinner feeding can be noisy.  These cancel out all the loud barking and howling that goes on!  Would highly recommend!
"
Audrey,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After losing my old pair of the 2nd generation Airpods- I thought it was time for an upgrade. The old ones had lasted me 2 1/2 years, and I would mind spending extra money, especially considering how I keep them in my ears 10 out of 24 hours. These are real airpods- not fake.,The sound quality was marginally better than on the 2nd gens, but unless you’re an aspiring audiophile there isn’t mush if a difference. Battery life is the one improvement of note- they do last longer. The only problem is they don’t stay in the ear very well- I found myself constantly having to readjust them. One even fell out of my ear at one point, scaring me to death.,Another difference I didn’t like was instead of tapping to control, you had a tiny button to push on the side. This made for skipping songs much more tedious, and you risk pulling it out all together.,I will be returning these and getting another pair of 2nd gens. I am a young adult female for ear size reference- I’m bot sure how they would fit and adult size. Overall I’m disappointed I couldn’t use the newer model.
"
Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So I've had the OG airpods, the airpod pros, and now these... THESE are amazing. Listen, everyone's ears are different, but if these suit your ears, and you want great quality, then these are the ones for you. The airpod pros hurt my ears after long periods of use and the silicon tips tended to fly out of my ears regardless of the size. These third generation airpods fit perfectly, and no, they do not have noise cancellation, so if that is important for you, do NOT go for these. Overall, I'm satisfied as hell. Great design, long lasting battery life, they fit perfectly.
"
Valeriy Grigoryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a product with no flaws. All the wireless headphones that I had before - JBL and Samsung Buds Live had their own characteristics. We lost the network, stopped working at a certain position of the body (JBL when I leaned forward, and Samsung when I was lying))) it was terribly annoying. In addition, a stupid Samsung sensor that performs various actions when you try to simply correct the earpiece. And now all my problems and headaches for several years have been eliminated by purchasing AirPods (3rd Generation). This thing just works! Always and without any reservations! Everything is convenient here - a small flat case is convenient to carry in a bag and in a pocket, control buttons with a clear response instead of a stupid sensor. They don’t strain at all when wearing, and at the same time they don’t even try to fly out of the ear in any position of the body (this is important for me when working with my reptiles). Of course, there are probably better wireless headphones than these, but my search for headphones for myself is already over)
"

  This watch took a bit of time for me to learn, works very well if you have iPhone I have the 10r and it was a great set up. At first you can become overwhelmed by all the choices but you won't regret it. I use this watch for my walks and my yoga and it keep my information available. It has helped me in my daily life to get up and move or even breath.

   First, I love the color. I had another brand fitness watch that I really liked but this one is awesome and I love it. It has all the amenities and syncs to my iPhone perfectly. There is only one thing I think needs improvement, the battery life. I've found myself recharging the watch more often than desired.

  After my wife’s Apple series 3 watch started to show its age (no more updates and occasional crashes) I decided she needed a Hanukkah present before we left for a European vacation.,She was delighted.  The usable screen is bigger than my 44mm Apple Watch,  the display never goes dark, yet the battery life is better.,As we get older the health options of the new watch are a welcome addition.
"
Football Nani,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love everything about this watch! It charges quickly and the battery life is good. Like other rechargeable devices the more you do with it the faster it goes down. Since it charges so quickly that’s no big deal. I didn’t like the band because it’s too sweaty in in the summer. I think I should have gotten the one with cellular because this one has to be near my phone to do some things. Another piece of advice I have for others is to get an adapter when you get your watch so you can charge it. I couldn’t set mine up until the adapter came.
"
dmoskaly,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had an SE which was just fine, didn’t need  the extra sensors. But, and here’s the big but as in bigger and brighter display. I use my watch often during exercise and its nice to take a quick look at my metrics without effort not to mention just regular use. Four stars because even though it was at a sale price, it’s still in my opinion over priced by $50-$75.

  Rápido, intuitivo, tecnológico, ligero y a la vez robusto en su construcción aportando sensación de durabilidad. La integración con el iPhone 13 Pro Max y los Air Pods Pro es increíble, es como tener un solo dispositivo multifuncional. Es primera vez que tengo un AW y la verdad me encanta su funcionalidad, apps como las de monitoreo de salud en tiempo real son realmente increíbles como el hecho de tomarte en escasos 30 segundos un electrocardiograma, medir el nivel de oxigenación en la sangre y en general todo lo relacionado al tema de salud esta genial. Podes contestar llamadas con buena comunicación en doble vía y además te permite usar muchos shorcuts que te hacen tu día a día mas amigable.
"
Florida Stanley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First time Apple Watch user and still learning the ropes and abilities of the watch. I don’t know why it would take some people forever to set their watch up as it personally took me less than 30 minutes. As long as you have ios15, it shouldn’t take you that long. So just make sure your phone is running the latest software version before doing watch set up.,Keep in mind, you MUST order a separate charging block as they do not include one for you but this should not prevent you from setting up the watch. My watch came 70% charged so I was able to do everything I needed to set up.,I got the Starlight 41mm delivered yesterday and it is beautiful. I’m still playing around with the watch but it’s fun. I’ve used the ECG and Blood Oxygen apps and those were neat. I’ve never had an AW before so I can’t compre the battery life to previous modes but it’s definitely holding it’s charge very well.

Carla S. LeLaCheur,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have no idea if I will like it or not. My first Apple watch and I live in a small town with not many places to shop and you don't include a $10.00 charging plug when I pay $800 for an apple watch. The end won't fit in any of my charges. You really should disclose when I ordered or send me a free one. One would assume for that kind of money I would be able to charge it without having to search to find a plug. I AM NOT HAPPY The reason many of us shop online is because we don't have a Best Buy or Apple Store just around the corner.

  I thought the viewing experience would be less with the smaller sized iPad. But the screen is good, and the 'blooming' on the 12.9"" put me off from getting it so bought the 11"" instead. Also the weight together with the magic keyboard is already heavy so choosing the 11"" would be better if you're planning to bring this around outside with you most of the time.

  I’m downsizing from a 27in iMac to this 24in and I can hardly tell the difference. Every video I watch on the screen is smooth, vivid, and clear. Due to the new Apple M1 chip, 4K videos play without any lag and no matter how many apps I’m using, this computer doesn’t even stutter. It is amazing how they can fit such a quiet and powerful computer into a body that is as thin as a macbook. Speakers are so small yet they are stronger than previous models. The magic mouse, keyboard, power cable, and included lightning cable are color matched, even the sticker is color matched to your model! I highly recommend getting the 8 core/8 core gpu model as the base model doesn’t come with the touch ID on the keyboard - a very underrated feature. The upgrade from the base model also includes an ethernet jack on the power brick as well as 2 more usb-c jacks in the back. The power button and aux jack are located to the left of the screen on the back and side. This is not just a computer for casual home use, it will function perfectly for the majority of users - person and business. If you are looking for a new Mac, look no further.

  3 weeks after buying this computer I was asked to do an update which on my DSL took 8+hours, After the download I was told to restart after which I was ask things as if I was setting the computer for the first time . Then the computer would not connect with my print which is was working just fine prior to the update, I talked to 2 different AppleTechs ( I bought a service contract) 1 tech conversation was about the download issue  another tech was about the printer issue.They could not fix my problem. That was an all day ORDEAL.  Amazon is going to give me a refund.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Never had an Apple Mac before.  Used pc's for 30 plus years.  Decided to try an iMac and this seemed to be the latest with the M1 chip.  I also purchased the Microsoft for Mac conversion so that I could still use EXCEL, WORD and POWERPOINT.  I also set up the file transfer from my laptop pc to the iMac. While it took about an hour to transfer files, it was successful, although it did NOT transfer pictures nor favorite bookmarks, so I had to go to each web site and save on Safari.  This took a while but Safari is much faster than the other sites I have used in the past. For example, on pc it took 3 minutes to get to my bank's website, on the iMac it takes about 5 seconds. This is an incredible machine. I still have a lot to learn about all it can do.  By the way, I am 78 years old, so don't panic about learning something new if you have never used an Apple product before.  I also recommend that you purchase the extended warranty which allows you to contact Apple support 24/7.  These people are very, very nice and are extremely helpful in solving problems if you should have any. I highly recommend this Apple iMac!!!!!

Larry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have favored using Apple products over the years. My work life has given me the opportunity to use Windows products when it comes to laptops and desktops. I have also owned Windows laptops and desktops for home use in the past and will never go back to them for my personal use.,I currently have a MacBook Air, iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Homepods, Apple TV and now this new iMac which has replaced my older iMac. Apple ties everything together using iCloud. When everything works together it just makes life easy. With this iMac I have now stepped up to a SSD and that along with the new M1 Processor it makes this machine fast. Really fast.,The migration assistance software that the iMac comes with allowed me to easily move everything over from my old iMac’s Time Machine backup. In no time at all I was up and running with my old desktop settings and all my Apps from my old iMac on this new machine. Rosetta 2 translates and runs a few Apps that are still Intel CPU coded.,The 24 inch display is another plus for me. Beautiful colors and resolution.,The fingerprint security on the keyboard is nice but my old iMac would unlock via my Apple Watch so it isn’t something that I would had to have.,One negative is the ports. You either buy a USB Hub or like me purchase a few USB-C to USB Adapters to allow older devices to connect to the newer ports.,I am pleased with it.

  I ordered this because I needed a mac to develop games for IOS (im not docking a star, but it's irritating that I have to click publish from a mac, not PC). I'm not a huge fan of macs, and don't expect to use it for much, so personally I love the minimalist design; however, if I were shopping for a computer to use a lot, I wouldn't be a huge fan. Its not bad on speed and power but the adorable mouse and keyboard are anything but ergonomic. They're both awkwardly sized and shaped.

  Let me begin by saying the obvious: There is nothing like the Mac Experience. If you're using a PC, I'm sorry. Perhaps one day you will see the light. The iMac I purchased is beautiful in every way, and I have no complaints at all. However, I do have one tip for new buyers. Once you set up your iMac, the very first thing you need to do is make sure you have the latest OS. To do this, click on System Preferences and then click Software Updates. Most likely you'll need an update, so do that before you do anything else. You'll need to reboot your iMac and that will take a few minutes (it took mine around 15 minutes), but then you'll be able to do everything else you need to do, such as setting up your App Store account. Other than that, the iMac is ready to go out the box, and what a beautiful box it is. Enjoy!

  I usually hate writing reviews (doing Amazon's work without getting paid, after all) but it seems like there's a lot of reviews either praising these to the ends of the earth or pitching fits about one or two issues to give them 1 star.,I originally tried Sony's XM4s, since lots of reviews seemed to show they were a similar quality for a big price difference. Mine were plagued with connection issues, either unable to connect most of the time or dropping it constantly on Apple, Android, and Windows devices alike. When I saw these available for a rare discount, it made sense to pull the trigger, with a price point only $100 higher than XM4s for much higher quality. The sound is strikingly crisp for wireless headphones, the build quality is insane, the adjustable band works well on heads of all sizes, and it's so easy to swap devices, change noise cancellation, etc.,Transparency mode is unmatched, makes it mighty easy to hear what's going on around you without it drowning out your music. Noise cancelling is also great, but I'm not a big fan of how any headphones solve that. Battery life doesn't lead competitors at all, but is more than enough to last many days of active use.,Main drawbacks? The price without a discount is really too steep, go for these on sale. The inability to turn them off with a power button instead of the admittedly stupid case is weird, but they barely lose any power on standby mode, so folks are really making a mountain out of a molehill on that point. I haven't experienced condensation issues yet, but will update if that happens. Not including the audio jack at this price point is also absurd, especially when these are being presented as a middle ground between normal headphones and audiophile options.,Again, definitely worth picking up if you can score a discount, but I'm not sure I'd be as enthralled at the standard $550 price point.

  Got mine today. I have spent quite some time with them and i will share the pros and cons. I will also compare them to my xm3s.,Pros,Great build quality.,Good sound ( a balanced sound , not bass heavy) , I still think xm3s and xm4s are better,Eco system,Cons,Not worth the price,Heavy,Can easily get scratches on the caps,Strong clamping force which makes them really uncomfortable,Cannot turn off,Cannot fold,Conclusion,For $500, I expected a mind blowing experience but nope. I am an apple fan, but this wasn’t it. I am returning them and will wait for better apple headphones

  I have been an Apple customer from back in the mid-80s when I bought a Mac 512e computer. No hard drive...just internal and external floppy drives. Since then I've owned a large number of Mac computers, iPhones, iPads, iPods...you name it. When the headphones came out, I was a little shocked by the price but decided to give them a try anyway. I've been very impressed with them so far. The manufacturing quality is top-notch, as you would expect, and the sound is very, very nice. The noise cancellation is outstanding and I love the Using an oversized wristwatch-type crown to control the volume is genius! Are they heavy? I don't really notice it, but I take a break every couple of hours. Whether or not they're worth the price is subjective. I'm happy with my pair, but there are other headphones made by Sony and other companies that are very good and can be bought for hundreds of dollars less. I'm very satisfied with the AirPods Max, and if you're willing to pay the price, I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied too.
"
Mike Mackintosh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was skeptical because of the price tag but working from home my employee gave me a couple dollars to spend on some things that might make it a little bit easier. Because I was tired of uncomfortable headphones and in your ear buds that left my ears sore after hours of meetings every day I decided to try these. They are amazingly comfortable. I’m 604 with a larger head than most people and they fit very well. They do not press into my ears but lightly sit over them in the cushions are very well designed. The sound quality is like having a HomePod in your ear. I highly recommend for the price, as these are the last headphones you’ll ever buy!
"
Otis Maximus williams,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  you move the dang thing off your ear and somethjing happens...instructions are completely vague-tried to use it to watch movies on my ipad-battery doesn't last at all...so called 'case' the thing goes in is awkward and clumsy...but the sound just is no better than sony headphones that cost less than half of this...these things are just not worth the money...sorry Apple, I've been disappointed by you before, but this is the WORST of the disappointments
"
Nic,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm an admitted ""Apple fanboy"" so this is coming to you from a purely objective place. These boys are heavy - and I have a giant head to support the weight. Once they're on, even at the appropriate size, which is generous, there isn't a lot of sound isolation even when noise cancellation is turned on. This is just the nature of having very cushy ear cups, I suppose. My 3 year old pair of Beats Studio3 do a better job (which is depressing). To keep it short, I did return these. I like the idea of a ""premium audio experience"" a lot, but my advice if you're on the fence at all is to buy the AirPods Pro instead. There's no volume control, but at least they're portable, versatile, and more than sufficient for everyday listening.
"
Diedickekatze,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was lucky to find these at Amazon when everywhere else is continually out of stock.  When I received them, I noticed the box was in a bag, but the box itself was not sealed.  When I took them out and charged them, then tried to connect to my phone, they wouldn’t because they were already paired with another device. I had to totally reset them to get them to connect.  Be careful ordering, they might be someone else’s return.  They are comfortable, and the noise cancelling was quite good, but the sound wasn’t.  I thought maybe Apple worked in some kind of voodoo to make music files sound better, but no, you’re still limited by a standard Bluetooth connection.  Tidal’s MQA files didn’t sound any better than Apple’s 256 kbit.  Ultimately, I chose to return these, which was a painful process in itself.  Bottom line, try these out before you spring for them.  They might be right for you, but they weren’t for me.
"
Bonwell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I grew up in the CD era and saw movies of people with big headphones sinking into their beds and disappearing into the music, and I never really understood it… until now. I have several electronics that “support” Dolby Atmos, but the combination of these headphones plus Apple remastering old albums – it is literally like I’m truly hearing the music for the first time. The quality is just unreal.,Four stars because there are still relatively few songs (and movies) that truly take advantage of what these headphones are capable of. They are heavy and hurt my head after a while, and maybe it’s just me but the hum from noise cancellation gives me an immediate headache. Also, if you’re used to rocking out with earbuds that go straight into your ear canal, these are going to seem much quieter in comparison.
"
MrE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excellent wireless noise canceling headphones for a single wireless device.  Very comfortable.  Is it worth the price? Probably not… but as I’ve heard many places, neither is most of high end tech we purchase today.  So, I’ll probably wear them until the metal fatigues itself to pieces to justify my “splurge”,Serious lack of forethought for the the fact that most people have at least 2 devices (one touch based and one keyboard based). Every Bluetooth device I’ve owned for the past 7 years has been able to connect to and automatically switch between the different sources.  For a company that wants you to do it one way and seamlessly integrate that’s a major miss IMO. If you then factor in things like watching movies past other household members bedtimes, there’s the manual switch to the TV.,On a much less noticeable issue the fact that these cannot do losses even though you can spend $15 for lighting to head phone and another $35 for another headphone to lightning… JUST to be able to listen wired (apparently they still need battery as well when wired though I haven’t tested myself), it STILL isn’t lossless :).  On top of that they then released the head turning media campaign for their lossless platform, and they have no way to use these for that.
"
Simeon Weaver,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So much about AirPods max is great. The sound quality is vastly superior to the pros. Much more detail in in movies and music. Transparency mode is greatly improved. The noise cancellation is the best I’ve heard on any headphones or earbuds. I really like the sound dial mostly cause it’s the same as an Apple Watch but the location and design could have been improved. I really hate the price but luckily I got them on sale but at least Apple could have evaded included their $35 wired cord to make it a little more worth the price crazy of $550. I’m not really a fan of the overall shape of the ear cups, to me they look like the headphones you wear when you go shooting. The mesh on the top of the headphones are really comfortable I really can’t feel much on the top of my head. One massive flaw with these is that they don’t have a power button and you have to put them in the case to prevent the battery from draining. But whenever I extend the headphones it feels like I’m about to break them but it’s smoother than other headsets and other headphones just click instead of sliding in. I don’t know if it’s just me but when I plug in the it makes cord a bussing sound in the left ear. There are many nice headphones out there but these are the nicest headphones I’ve ever put over my beautiful ears. But really suggest getting a different carrying cause though.

Attilahun,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought four pairs of these and all four users report consistent complaints from people on the other side. Sounds quality is bad.,The 1st gen worked great.,The 2nd gen were god awful and never connected.,This new 3rd gen connects but people say every fifth word is garbled.,Come on Apple!! Spend one billion of your four hundred billion in cash and make some AirPods that don’t suck!!!!
"
bonkin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Good sound.  (Came partially charged.) BUT, can not charge using cord included with it, as it is USB C.  (Not the case with my other Apple AirPods that came with my I Phone 12Pro Max purchased in February 2021.) Cant charge these new AirPods on my Dell laptop either, purchased in 2019, or with any charging cubes I have.  SO, now I had to order adapters and wait until they arrive next week.  ANNOYING!
"
Alyssa,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had the generation 2 airpods for two years and have loved them. I decided to upgrade to the newest version, I really wanted to love them but they kept falling out of my ear after a few minutes. The sound quality was great but they have changed the shape of the ear bud and now no longer stay in my ears. I even tried the twist method to insert them but it was no use. I used to go running in my generation 2's and they never fell out. But they made the bud larger and now they fall out after a couple minutes. So I guess if you have larger ears they might be great but I was really disappointed and will be returning.

Samuel Lawson Mingo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The gen 2 fit perfectly. Wore them for very long hours. Never an issue being active with those. The gen 3 are bigger and fit weird and will pop out if I intentionally stretch my jaw multiple times. I’m keeping them because they sounds really good. Better drivers, spatial audio, and battery life make it worth it for casual use. Haven’t test the water resistant. If the gen 2’s fit without issue, these will be to big, but if you deal with the discomfort for a week you’ll get use to it. Music is good, but pair it to Apple TV 4K with a good Dolby Atmos movie and holy crap! Some scenes in Dune were something else. They really do sound better for Bluetooth buds.
"
Vas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I owned 1st gen and they were perfectly designed, always stayed in ears. I bought these, hoping for better sound quality and battery life, which they deliver. However, to my absolute disappointment, these headphones do not stay in my ears. I keep losing them while sitting down. I bought headphones for gym use, I can't take these to the gym now, or wear it without fear of losing them. Waste of money, poor product.

"

  I like the 3’s for some things and the 2’s for others.,The 2s have a warmer sound signature and stay in your ears way better - and are lighter.,The 3’s have better technolog, battery life and water resistance. I don’t have the same issues with the mic that I did with the 2’s on phone calls etc.,Both are good. If your primary use is phone calls get the 3s.

Ashley L.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Waited years to spend the money on wireless Apple AirPods and was so excited to finally gift myself these for Xmas! I decided if I was finally going to purchase, I might as well get the newest version and I’m so disappointed that I did. I’m a ‘normal’ sized woman. 5’4 and 135 pounds and these AirPods literally just fall out of my ears. Just walking they fall out. They’ve fallen out as I walk in snow (trying to find the tiny white AirPod in the white snow is beyond annoying) They’ve fallen into the sink. How do they not stay in my ears??? The sound is fine, etc. But I have to wear a soft headband on my head to go to the gym so my headphones don’t fall out. Wish I’d purchased the AirPod Pros as I’ve been told those stay in place.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They sounded fine although I only listened for about 20 minutes for fear they were going to fall out of my ears at work. The old ones fit in my ears just fine. I never had an issue of them falling out on their own unless they got knocked out. These I constantly had to keep pushing them back in because they would come so far out of my ear. Another thing I didn’t like was the button to play or pause what you’re listening to. The old double tap is so much more convenient to do and so much faster. Bottom line: I’d you like the way the old ones fit and work I do not recommend these.

  I really only used my Apple Watch for tracking activity and reading texts. I could never really respond to texts unless I wanted to use the canned responses.

I also love that the battery life is such that you can use it to track sleep and it charges really fast. I thought the 41mm would be so much bigger than my Series 1 but it's not and the new design allows the face to be used more efficiently. Glad I upgraded.

Christopher R. Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I considered buying a used apple watch a couple years ago, because the current watch at the time didn't seem to do much more than the older watches. Then the 7 was going to come out with always on feature, and larger screen, which for me was the thing I wanted. I'm so far loving it. The ability to switch between always on faces means it can go from looking like an elegent watch (plain, artistic face) to utilitarian with a swipe. The added health features are a bonus. Although I don't really need them, I could see those features being very handy for an older user that's trying to monitor changes to heart rate, O2 saturation, etc.

   I have bought 4 imac and spent over a 1400$ for each. The imacs were shipped to me outside the US. I have just received the first Imac. And it's not functional. No signs of power. Nothing. The power supply is supplying power normally i had it checked. Yet the imac itself isn't working. I spoke to the support. Asking for help. Knowing that a return would cost me more than the imac's price due to the heavy weight of the package. Yet the customer support don't seem to care. I even asked for a partial gift card. And they wouldn't. Claiming that they don't have the option to do so or even to refund or partial refund me.,Waiting for the other 3 imacs.,Note : we don't even have Apple stores in here so i could have it fixed. That was the main reason i had to order it of amazon. Which ended up a bad experience.

  This is a brand new computer. And to get it I took a big leap of faith by finally leaving Windows and adopting Apple. However after about 2 weeks I could not login. Both the mouse and keyboard stopped responding. Apple could not resolve the problem and are sending replacement items. I am very skeptical because I don’t think this will resolve the problem because I find it very unlikely that both the keyboard and mouse which are brand new stop working at the same time!,As I suspected there was nothing wrong with the mouse and keyboard, I just happened to interact with a Representative who did not know what to do. After I got the replacement items the problem persisted but when I called again I got the right person who helped me fix the problem.,However, one major complaint I have about this computer is that IT HAS TO BE PLUGGED  TO A POWER SOURCE TO WORK. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A BATTERY. When I called Apple the person I spoke to confirmed that for the computer to turn on it must be plugged to a power source! That is my disappointment, a different kind of disappointment!.,I have changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. Could not give a higher rating because:,1. The computer does not have any autonomy and has to be plugged to a power source to work!,2. The mouse is not the best there is, not ergonomic,  needs to be moved around on a smooth surface for scrolling, the location of the charger at the bottom is awkward!

  I was very happy that Apple decided to issue colors on their new iMacs. I got the blue one and I can't be more happy with my purchase. I have always loved the apple designs and this new thinner iMac is amazing. Its quiet and very quick to start up. I would suggest getting the mid-tier model as I felt that the base model is too cheap. As a side note get the ram and storage options that you want because this all in one unit can not be modified one you get it out of the box. Also I would opt for the magic keyboard with the 10 key pad. I did not and I wished I did as all the accessories are colored matched and can not be purchased separately . but like I said go with the mid tier and you won't be disappointed.

  This is/was a replacement for an older iMac.  Buying from Amazon got it here quicker, but with fewer choices of build,(1)  I thought I had bought the Apple Care add on service, but evidently did the order wrong on the Amazon website.  Get the Apple Care.  Amazon's ""included"" tech service is not comparable.  Pay the $ extra up front.,(2). There is no printed instruction manual for this machine.  All web based.,(3)  This machine has different connector cables than my old USB (and likely yours).  Talk to an Apple knowledgeable rep and get  the right adapters to connect your printer, etc. peripherals with the machine..

Hook it up to an external NAS server and all of a sudden 256GB seems like a lot of storage.,I like this machine a lot already. the best? 1080p FaceTime Camera, the screen is simply awesome and it is my new go-to for teleconferencing and working from home machine.,Bear in mind, in their desktop world, this is an entry-level machine. Designed for 'home entertainment' more than professional work.

  The new Apple chip on this computer is a problem for third party apps. Getting Parallels and Windows set up was a horrendous problem. Also, my Samsung external SSD hard drive will connect but data on the drive is unavailable. Apple support on this was well-intended but ineffective (turned over to the ""engineers."" Also the speakers are an annoyingly deep base and there is no treble/base adjustment option.  So the voice of invitees on Zoom meetings is unnatural and at times indistinct. Apple support recommendation:  (1) get a third party app to adjust the base treble or (2) take the computer to an Apple store and have them look at it  ( a ""fools errand"" if I ever heard one!)  So luckily I ordered the computer from Amazon and can return it. I will then purchase the 21.5 inch iMac from Amazon. So think carefully before you purchase this technological marvel.

  I have only had this $1600 INac for a couple of weeks and for what ever reason it just locks up. I am now on a first name basis with Apple Tech. Support. Not happy considering to s  ex nd it back. The computer I had for 14 years which is not an Apple worked just fine in all the years I ownyit. Very disappointed.

  I chose to purchase from Amazon instead of direct from Apple because of the shipment speed available on Amazon. And let me tell, it was a fast and simple process. I was able to take advantage of 5% cash back putting the purchase on my Amazon store card which was great!,This iMac is absolutely beautiful and I wouldn’t hesitate to make a large purchase like this on Amazon again in the future.

  These are insane. I’ve had several AirPods and have a pair of AirPods Pro. My expectations were somewhat high with these Max. Right out of the box the sound cancellation wasn’t that great and I was disappointed. But then it updated itself and now it’s even way better than my Pros. I also love not having to shove them in my ears constantly. Very comfortable I don’t understand the weight complaints. Sound quality is insane. No complaints they’re exactly what I wanted and more! Love the turn dial!

  While they pack a hefty price, the AirPods Max are worth it for their incredible sound and build quality. I highly recommend them for discerning listeners.,I’ve heard that a lot of people were disappointed with the sound quality, however with a small amount of effort you can EQ them for a much brighter sound than they have out of the box. The EQ controls are accessed on your iPhone or iPad settings under “Headphone Accommodations.”,Being constructed of metal and aluminum, AirPods Max initially felt pretty heavy on the head, but after a while, I got used to it.,The so-called “Smart Case” is incredibly stupid to be honest. I highly recommend buying a third party option. Many of them also have the magnets built in to put the headphones in low power mode. You can ditch the smart case all together.,While the always on quirk was kind of strange in the beginning, it has never really been an issue for me nor have the headphones discharged quickly because of it.,Overall I am very pleased with the headphones and highly recommend them!

  Be careful if you order this product. When they arrive new and you sync them, they should not come with someone else’s name attached to them already. Product clearly says new, but I received a pre-owned product. Huge bummer.
"
Michael,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was enjoying this headset.  It fit in well with all my Apple items.  Noise cancellation was excellent... best I have experienced.,But, battery life was horrible.  Even when you put them in the case, which puts them to sleep... you can't turn them off otherwise.  I would put a fairly charged set in the case and sleep it went then took them out the next morning and the dreaded red light came on indicating the battery was in dire need of charging.  In doing some research I saw that many others were noting this issue on Apple talk boards.,One other issue, the controls on the top of the ear pads often got activated when trying to take off the headset... I found them to be awkwardly placed.  I found the Bose 700 controls much easier to use and less obtrusive, for instance.  Very awkward placement.,So, I returned them, sadly.  I really enjoyed them otherwise.
"
Eric L. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love these headphones for work videoconferences.  Comfortable enough to wear all day, replaceable ear cups, great sound for calls, movies and music.  The spatial audio support is also great for an immersive experience.  At first I hesitated because of the cost, but these easily beat out my Sony noise-cancelling headphones as well as my Airpod Pro's for home use.  The only thing I don't like is that they don't fold well for travel - but I have the other headphones for that.
"
Fallah,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As an AirPods Pro user, one of the biggest downsides of the design is the reduced sound quality when using the mic due to power splitting. I was hoping with the price premium and size of the AirPods Max this would no longer be an issue. It was, however, with sound quality dropping when in a call.,Also, the top band is extremely tight no matter how I tighten or loosen it. This makes the headphones unbearable to wear after an hour, giving a serious headache.

  Pros:,- Easy to use (no weird touch gestures or weird controls),- Love that its always on and ready.,- easy integration with the apple eco system. no apps required.,- sounds very good,- comfortable, love the breathable ear cushions.,Cons:,- Started to have connectivity issues with my Mac after 3C39 update.,- Some times wouldn't charge beyond 75% (not tested after 3C39 update),- the flimsy case is required to get firmware updates.,- expensive,- charges with lightning cable.,- battery wouldn't last one week with light everyday use.,- little heavy,- smelled very bad out of the box.,There is a lot of room for improvement. Feel like paying the early adapter tax with the experience changing with every firmware update.,I was expecting a much better experience overall.
"
Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound reproduction is flat… in other words just as it was recorded.  Virtually no latency ( lip sink) issues.  They’re fairly heavy, but once on they are very comfortable and you rarely notice the weight. They seem to be designed to be ventilated so your ears don’t get as warm as other higher end Headphones.  The ANC is excellent and in the pass through mode the ambient sound is mildly amplified!  I actually hear better with them on.  Just note I’m an old guy so… may not be as noticeable to younger folks but the transparency mode is great, just like the ANC.  Listening to Spatial Audio and Sony 360 music with These is simply amazing. These are not inexpensive headphones but if it’s in your price range I can highly recommend these!  Apple did a great job with these.  I only wish I could pair them with my iPhone and another device like my Apple TV at the same time.  But… these are great headphones and again if it’s in you’re price range well worth the money!
"
A. Cox,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nearly everything is great about these. Build quality. Sound quality. Great Active noise cancellation. Great controls. Nearly. Because I can’t get over the weight. After an hour or so, I find myself fiddling with them. I’m trying to get used to it. I’m sure I can, but for now, still heavy. Not too sure I would want to wear them for a seven hours Intercontinental flight. Anyway, I’m still keeping them for now, because the rest is great.
"
Shnakepup,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've previously used the original AirPods and the AirPods Pro. In particular, I really valued the noise cancellation on the Pro. However, I had issues with one of the Pro earbuds developing a crackling noise. I had it replaced, but after the warranty period expired, then the other earbud developed the same issue. I saw the AirPods Max go on sale and I had a gift card so I took the plunge. This is definitely more than I would normally pay for headphones but I figured that I had a good track record with Apple so far, all things considered, and I assumed the premium cost would be reflected in the quality of the product. Unfortunately, the Max fell short.,First, the good: the build quality seems good. The headband is comfortable, and I never get any pain on the top of my head from wearing it for long periods of time (which frequently happens to me with other headphones). The volume dial/button/crown thing is nifty, and I like that there's a dedicated button to toggle back and forth between Transparency Mode and noise cancellation. Similar to the AirPods Pro, it also does an auto-pause thing when you take them off which is much appreciated. The overall sound quality seems really good, though I'm not an audiophile so I can't say much more than that.,Some minor gripes: the volume dial/button/crown thing can be a little squirrely. I wish it required a little more resistance to push down or turn. As it is right now, I find myself often accidentally activating it. Also, the auto-pause feature sometimes doesn't work correctly. It definitely knows when it's completely off your head but often doesn't recognize if I've pulled them down around my neck; despite not being on my ears anymore, I can still hear the music or whatever playing. I'm guessing it uses proximity sensors or something to detect if it's ""on"" your head or not, and being on your neck confuses it? I dunno, seems like that's something they should've accounted for, as that's a pretty natural thing to do with headphones like these. Also, seems like half the time if I take them off then put them back on, it'll automatically unpause, but half the time it won't and I need to manually resume. Not a huge deal but irritating and inconsistent. Also, one last minor gripe: the tops of my ears sometimes gets sore in these, because when I put them on, they touch the inner wall of the ear cup (which is covered in rough material). I guess my ears are bigger than what they designed for?,Lastly, the problems. Or mostly just the one problem: the noise cancellation doesn't seem all that great. It seems like it *could* be great, or maybe is *supposed* to be, but maybe the shape of my head just doesn't conform to Apple's assumptions. When I wear the Max and have noise cancellation on, it's inconsistent in how it blocks out sound. For instance, if I turn my head to one side, the quality of the cancellation shifts wildly (either from good-to-nonexistent or vice-versa). I work with multiple monitors so this is something I'm doing a lot, and it's very distracting to have the noise cancellation shift so much every time I do this. Also, I've noticed that if I literally press down on the sides (i.e. pressing them more onto my ears) the cancellation gets dramatically better. It seems like the ear cups aren't getting a good seal against my head and thus are letting in too much outside noise. I've tried adjusting the headband in various ways but nothing seems to help.,This is a pretty major disappointment for me. Considering the price, I would expect the noise cancellation to be at least on par with the AirPods Pro, if not better. Perhaps they are if you have the right shape head and ears, but unfortunately that's not the case for me. Maybe it's not fair to compare the Max to the Pro, since the Pro are in-ear buds vs the Max's over-ear design. But STILL...look at the price! I'm not sure why these are so much more expensive. If you're looking at both of these, what's the advantage to getting the Max over the Pro? I really can't think of anything that's THAT much better on the Max. Like I said before, maybe the sound quality is much better on the Max, but I honestly can't tell the difference. The one thing that DOES stick out to me is the noise cancellation experience, and these are definitely not as good.

KLWCRNA,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Unfortunately, this product did not even last 3 months without the battery life falling flat. The laptop will not stay on more that a few minutes without shutting down. It's especially poor when there are a number of tabs open. The laptop must be plugged up continually or it will shut down without warning. Very frustrating to pay this much for a product in such poor quality.

trs,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Disappointing product. Massive buds, barely fit my ear and liable to fall out at the slightest turn of my head. Generally uncomfortable because of their size. The audio is not great either, in that these are quiet compared to 1st generation airpods. The spatial sound crap doesnt make a noticeable difference in audio quality. Considering returning.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Almost immediately I noticed that these were not as secure as the 1st and 2nd generation AirPods.  Any jaw movement whether chewing or smiling would eventually cause them to break loose from my ear canal.  Unfortunately I had to return them and buy the 2nd generation.,I will say the sound quality was a massive improvement over the previous AirPods and that almost convinced me to keep them.  Anyone who is interested in these should definitely try them on at an Apple store before buying.
"
ABT,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The headphones are improved over 2nd generation but they are overpriced by like $100. In my opinion, they have better bass than pro model but horrible noise canceling. In my opinion, Tozo NC2 headphones have a better bass, noise canceling and battery life and costs less than 1/3 of the price ( currently they are on sale for $50). I own over 20 pairs of headphones and i would never recommend this model to anybody.
"
Jackie Hall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This gen of airpods are shaped differently than previous generations and the ones with wires too. They are much bigger and sit in your ears odd. The spatial audio is cool but seems to be more of a party trick than anything else so far. I haven't found a decent use for it. It also has a fixed spatial audio setting that makes it feel like the music isn't just in your ears but it's kinda 360? Hard to describe but it feels like the music is also in front of you. The battery life is really good. I'm always surprised when they're dying because I honestly can't remember the last time I've charged them. Overall I enjoy them, but I think there needs to be more features or media that supports spatial audio.

  Once you switch over to Apple’s Bluetooth EarPods you’ll wonder why you’ve put it off for so long. There are no drawbacks — only pleasure.,The mic is perfect for phone conversations and people tell me they can’t tell the difference between these and the mic on my iPhone.,Cutback somewhere else in life and finally reward yourself with these.

Adam,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Compared to gen 2, these sound better and spacial audio is a pretty good feature.  But, the fit is not as comfortable, they are a little larger in the ear.  They feel like they're about to fall out, especially after smiling or laughing.,Edit, these are just too uncomfortable to wear long term.  Returning for the 2nd Gen's which are much more comfortable.
"
Carrina ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are my first pair of Air pods and I was so excited to use them. The sound is great, the convenience of pairing with my iPhone is cool too but these things make your ears sore!!

I got my dad a pair too and he likes his.. to each their own I guess :) i feel like beats could have been a bit cheaper and more comfortable..

  I'm generally a big fan of Apple products, but purchasing the airpod pro was a mistake. Unfortunately, return policy is very limited. Here are some limitations IMHO:,1) Even with a good seal, an airpod can fall out, everyone I know, who has one, has had this happen, and a few have lost one when this happened. Cheaper third party models sometimes have a thin cord connecting the two earpieces so something like this or an over the ear retainer would be an improvement.,2) Checking battery life is a hassle particularly if you left your case home. My Bose headphones announce the % charge when I turn them on and this would be an improvement for the airpod,3) Touching the stem to control some features is not reliable.,4) A big safety concern is that the airpod dampens external sounds (like approaching cars) even when turned off or in the transparency mode (noise suppression off). Of course, one can take it out of the ear and maybe lose it.,5) noise suppression is not that impressive.,6) if one is just going to use them at your desk, one can get a better microphone and headphones for less money.,7) battery life unimpressive and only lasts a few hours,I'm probably going to go back to my Bose headphones and either toss or give away the airpods

  Disappointing experience - ordered from Amazon and one unit was Dead on Arrival and and tried to have the airpods replaced by Amazon. Instead they told me to go to an Apple store and tell them to fix it. This is the new Amazon.com experience,I returned these for a refund and intended to buy another pair but the black friday deal was only one per customer no exceptions.,Nice.,Got a working pair at Warlmart of all places.,The earpod pros are really good for one thing - phone calls. I have a lot of earphones and headphones and as far as musical playback they're simply average. Noise cancelling is a bit laughable. Transparency mode is useful in the right settings. And the battery life is poor as is the fit if you have large ear canals.,Don't get me wrong, I bought them for phone calls on my iphone and they're good at that - great. But I don't use them in the gym, car, planes, or basically anywhere else.

  Los audífonos son geniales, se cargan al 100% en poco tiempo, se conectan rápidamente al iphone siempre y cuando se tenga activo el bluetooth. La cancelación de ruido es muy buena, aunque he visto reviews donde dicen que los audífonos de sony son mejores en eso y además tienen servicio de Alexa y Google. Pienso que si tienes iphone estos airpods son la mejor opción por la compatibilidad y uso de Siri.,Algo que no me gusta mucho, en mi caso, es que la parte que ingresa al oído es un poco más grandes que los airpods de segunda generación o audífonos con cable donde sentía que ni los llevaba puestos. Al ponerme los airpods pro, al inicio se siente bien pero ya después de una media hora empieza una ligera molestia que hace que no sea muy cómodo llevarlos puestos por mucho tiempo, si es tu caso como el mío analiza bien antes de comprarlos para que puedas disfrutarlos por mucho más tiempo.,Viene incluido 3 gomas intercambiables en talla S, M y L puedes probarlas, al configurarlos te hará una prueba para saber si está haciendo una correcta cancelación de ruido con la talla de gomas que estás usando.,Espero que en la siguiente generación de los airpods pro los hagan más ergonómicos para el oído.,Procura comprar un estuche para el cargador de los airpods pro ya que suele rayarse con facilidad.

J. Prefontaine,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don’t think these are the real thing. I don’t care that Amazon says they’re real- they’re NOT. My calls aren’t automatically picked up, my podcasts get interrupted constantly. I’m listening to a podcast when suddenly it stops; happens all the time! And even when they’re *in the case,* my phone will pick up my AirPods and try to connect to them, which is INFURIATING when you’re trying to put in on speaker or on phone. I can’t deal with these and I’m mad at myself for not waiting to just buy them  at the Apple Store or Best Buy. I’m going to see if I can return them.

  When my wife said the earbuds Pro would not connect I thought she was kidding.  She was right.  We tried with 4 different devices all with IOS 15 to no avail.  They would not even shown in the Bluetooth screen.  Contacting Apple support gave us the same advice than the original instructions.  The only solution was to drive 40 minutes to an Apple store for a new device that does not work.  Amazon only allows one per household?, so I bought Sony.  Will follow up once they are fully charged, in the Sony earbuds page. As of now, thanks to Amazon return policy, back they go……

  I got these to help with my insomnia. I had the regular Apple Ear Buds for a couple years, but they are uncomfortable if you are a side sleeper (which most sleep docs tell you is the best way to sleep).,Unfortunately these are way worse. There is almost no way to sleep on your side comfortably as the plastic digs in to the side of your head all night.  (Tried the Music Cozy too and had issues with volume being too low). How hard is it to make a comfortable earbud you can use for sleep!,Regarding noise cancellation- it's decent but not great.  Two examples: 1) On a recent flight I could hear a baby crying several rows back.  it was a bit muffled, but I definitely still heard it.  2)Tried these at the beach and could still hear the ocean.  Seems like they work best cancelling out voices, but oddly not other sounds as much
"
Sujoy Shivde,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are the refreshed AirPods Pro which now come with a Magsafe + Wireless Charging case. Apple silently updated it without much fanfare, but there's still a belief that these aren't new. So, the truth is, they do indeed now have added Magsafe, but pretty much everything else is still the same.,What I Like,The AirPods as expected integrate seamlessly. I use a MacBook and an iPad and the AirPods switch between them like a charm. Additionally I use these with my OnePlus 6T Android phone and they work fine like a Bluetooth earphone. Of course, I lose out on all the magical Apple-ish features Auto-Pause etc, but they still sound great. Did not notice any Bluetooth jittering or lags or frozen playback. Tried out Spatial Audio and some may call it gimmicky, but it was fun experience to have nevertheless. Apple Music now has a lot of music remastered for Spatial Audio, but even without, my original songs seemed to deliver some directionality with Spatial Audio and Head Tracking turned on. The ANC is really good and makes these a good light-weight pair of earbuds which block out distractions around you. They were great on train and bus rides and with some light music, you can get quietly comfortable. However, they're not suitable for flights because of both the battery life and the form factor. Flying definitely needs either a BOSE QC35/45 or Sony XM4s to deliver a long lasting comfort.,What I Don't Like,The manufacturing quality has taken a real bad hit. It seems that they shifted or started additional manufacturing in Vietnam, and the AirPods I received, did not feel like a premium $150 product. I could see the plastic joints, they felt rough, there was glue oozing out, and it was nothing like the first pair of AirPods Pro I tried 2 years back. So this was frankly disappointing. I don't care where Apple makes them as long as they're just as good since these don't come cheap.,The fit of AirPods Pro is something which works for some, and just doesn't work for some others. I'm in the later. They fit me fine sometimes, but other times they just pop out. There's no way I can use them, unless I have oil-free skin (oil in the hairs makes them fall out a lot faster) and I always have to push them in every 5 minutes. So, do check out the fit before you commit to these. I want to try the Beats Fit Pro, since they offer a near similar feature set (minus the Wireless Charging) and should stay in better.,I didn't find much value in investing a MagSafe Charger ($29) for now, and so picked up the cheapest Anker Wireless Charging pad I could. It works like a charm. If not, you can always charge with the included Lighting to USB-C Cable.
"
A. Raisch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Got these because they were on Christmas sale… normally $249, on sale for $180. No real need for them, because i had the older generation AirPods and they worked just fine, but the older ones hurt my ears after wearing them for a while (like 30-40 min) and the battery drained really fast on them. What i love about all AirPods is that it reads messages without my need for interfering… I’m a hygienist and my hands are preoccupied so i can’t check messages. I pop one AirPod in and can hear if my kid or someone messages me something important. Doesn’t interfere with my work… win win. Anywho… these new ones kept literally falling out of my ears. Not sure if i have weird ear shape, but never had issues before. Tried changing the sizes of the ear squish they come with, no dice. Also, i kept having an issue with them (right away) where it would say i left one of them somewhere i had been, recently, and was moving away from it. I had both ear pieces in hand. So, not sure why it kept thinking that but the concept of letting you know if you left them, is neat. All in all.. nice product, just not for me.
"
Joshua Windom,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  got them out the box unwrapped then and paired them to my phone, immediately the right one began to cut in and out and made very strange noises, even when nothing was playing, a few months later my airpods slipped out my pocket and my right airpods stopped working completely, prior to this it would cut off randomly, not pair, or wouldn’t turn on at all. It is possible that i just got unlucky with the right one because my left one worked wonderfully, but i’ve also heard the same thing from friends, and how fragile the airpod pros are.
"
KL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  great design - the classic apple experience. cool unboxing with unnecessary overengineered packaging, a sleek case and look, good weight to them due to the battery/extra hardware capabilities but not overly hefty, incredible active noise canceling and transparency options that you can't find on the other models (i think, right? not 100% sure), good battery life and a case that seems to hold a good bit of charge.,some things i'm not totally happy about are the ease of use for the controls, which will take time getting used to, and most of all the fit. the left earbud feels way less comfortable for me personally because it sits so tightly, and i'll have to take breaks wearing these every one or two hours. so that's something to be aware of. i'm not sure if any of the other options would feel better however

  I purchased this version of AirPods because my first generation stopped working after an extreme use. I have to say that so far, these are my favorite AirPods. The sound quality is insanely good, the connection is reliable, and I believe that it is worth the money you're paying for. I didn't want to get the Pro version because I already have noise cancellation headphones and I find it annoying sometimes when you need to have some sort of external noise to your ears.,Personal recommendation: please buy this product if you're not looking for noise cancellation headphones.
"
A. Davis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m an average sized woman. Sure, my hands are probably smaller than most, but I feel like my ears are probably average sized as well (including my ear canals). Well, these dang things are so big they don’t fit in my ears and they fall out immediately. So, consider that if the 2nd generation just fits, these are gonna be too big. Sad face.
"
Eeeecila,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve been using Airpods 1 since it came out. Battery life is getting bad (lasts about an hour on a Zoom call) so I needed an upgrade.,Was really excited to see Airpods 3 but read some mixed reviews so I went with Airpods Pro when they were on sale.,The pro is great but I just can’t get comfortable with the earplugs and I don’t really need NC (have a pair of Sony for that). So I decided to try out the AirPods 3 anyway (Apple store don’t let you try them on right now btw) and OMG I’m keeping the 3 for sure! They fit comfortably and stay on. Sound is awesome too and with Bass!,For those of you who’s deciding between Pro and 3, it really just comes down to Noise Cancelling and fit. If you don’t need NC and not sure about the fit, I have pretty standard girl size ears and they fit me completely without falling out!
"
Gen R,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Can’t tell you about battery life yet just received. It was a mistake gift. They are too large for my husbands ears but he won’t let me return them.

"
JayS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound is great (google how to update the firmware on your AirPods!) - loved the sound - but they're bigger than the AirPods 2.  Just sitting - not moving - and they popped out of my ears.  Working them in deeper - they still pop out of my ears.  So I'm returning the 3s and I'm sticking with the AirPods 2 which fit my ears perfectly.
"
Luis Cañadas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As expected from Apple products, the sound quality is awesome. The spatial sound feature is great and te battery life is a no worry.,The downside:,- The noise cancellation is not as good as the AirPods Pro,- They feel kinda loose in your ear and easily fall from it (already dropped one at the gym),- had to purchase those ear tips to secure when using them (solved the loose feeling),Apart from that, is a 4 out of 5. I’m pretty happy with them.
"
Electrical-Elk,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Compared to last generation (airpods 2), it seems like Apple has done a trade off between sound quality and wearing comfort ability. The sound quality has been improved (Bass), but for a long time use like 3 hrs, you might feel it pinch you eat a little bit which AirPods 2 does not have a issue. An the firmware for the 3rd generation is not perfect , you can hear some buzzing sound while not listen to anything. But I guess Apple is going to update the firmware in the future to eliminate this issue. Instead of upgrade form AirPods 2, I would say AirPods 3 is more like a intermediate version between 2 and pro.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound quality is definitely improved in these and the shorter stem makes these look great but I’m disappointed to see that the earpiece is larger than the previous model. One thing that did bother me though is that the pinch control on the left AirPod stops working I have to place it back in it’s charging case in order for it to work again maybe it’s defective because there was a time that it wouldn’t charge but overall they are good earbuds.
"
Patrick T Brownd,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What was Apple thinking when they designed this product?  Impossible to pull out of the charge case, hard to hold onto when placing in the ear, WILL NOT STAY IN THE EAR????  DID they not do any testing on this?,I bought these instead of the PRO's because I did not want to have  my ear sealed off with the cuff.  But this is ridiculous...they fall out when I am talking , they fall out if I smile, they barely stay on the ear at all.,Then when I go to put them in the charge case... they are not easily placed.  I have dropped them already many times just trying to put them in the charge case.  SUPER DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE
"
Calvin ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They are often for me a little hard to pinch out of the case compared to the 2nd gen but the amazing sound in your skull watching a movie is awesome!,I didn’t think the 2nd gen could get any better for watching movies or listening to music but here they are.,I bought a Mobosi case for it and love the brand for quality and protects my AirPods from loss.

Shelley Marevka,5.0 out of 5 stars,
Alex,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They’re the best headphones I’ve ever owned, besides two things:,1.) discomfort,for whatever reason, only my left ear becomes incredibly uncomfortable after wearing these for a few hours. I’m assuming my ear is pressing against the harder plastic bit on the back side of the detachable earcups (which are an excellent design, besides that).,2.) there’s no power button.,you can’t turn these on or off. the headphones decide that for you. this is a stupid feat of over engineering in all honesty, that on top of the laughable case are just some incredibly bizarre design decisions.,overall, the build quality is excellent. the noise cancellation is the top of its class. as far as bluetooth headphones go, audio quality is great. the simple volume knob is perfect.,i would say the price tag reflects all of that..
"
Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I consider myself firmly rooted in Apple's walled garden, but am by no means a zealous fanboy. That said, I would not buy these headphones without an iPhone and without an Apple Music subscription. The only way to justify the price tag is to make full use of every feature it offers and without those two you'll be out of luck. The soundstage is absolutely brilliant, and coupled with Dolby Atmos it will change the way some of your favorite tracks sound for the better. The sound-cancelling is first in class. Build quality is amazing and although I have experienced condensation during extended listening periods, they're easy to clean and it doesn't happen often.,It's easy to gawk at the price tag if you compare them to other noise-cancelling headphones on the market, but none of them offer the seamlessness these do. Make sure to spend time learning how to get the most of this pair before buying!
"
Walter L. Briggs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s nice when you have unrealistic expectations and you aren’t let down. Transparency mode is a notch below science fiction. I have mild hearing loss, and Apple Health allows you to integrate an audiogram and use it to correct the sound heard through Transparency. The active noise cancellation is also extremely nice.,Some people have problems with the ergonomics, but I find these to be quite comfortable.,They’re expensive, but I think they’re totally worth it.
"
John,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Noise cancelling is excellent. Best noise cancelling of any consumer wireless headphone. The rest is crap. They get really hot. I mean HOT. Also, moisture buildup in the ear cups definitely is a thing. They don’t get very loud either. Heavy. The heaviest. Don’t expect to listen for more than 30 minutes at a time because of the heat and heft. The case is garbage, but you probably already knew that. If your on the fence between headphones get the Sony XM4.

"
F10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First, this is and remains a wonderful product so I’ll spare excess commentary praising Apple. The first pair I received looked and sounded perfect. What I found odd is when I went to pair (which took more time than what I experienced with my Pro’s), the AirPods already had a name (in this case, Michael). Rather than risk it, I exchanged them for a new pair. Second round, packaging was more comprehensive (box was sealed, protective paper in place, etc) which candidly I did not notice was absent with the first. My advice - as exciting as the unboxing process is and as new looking as they may be, look for less obvious signs that you may have received somebody else’s gently used AirPods.
"
Greg Fleming,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love these new headphones. Some of the best audio I’ve ever heard. I had to buy because I buy everything Apple (yes I know these are expensive and I might have a problem).,Throughout using these the real advantage I’ve found is using these at my work place. I spend most of my day on the phone with clients. Unfortunately it can get loud with others doing the same and cause a distraction. These work great for calls and the ability to noise cancel helps me focus. Apple made my life easier and my production has gone up.
"
Anonymous ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Punchy sub bass with no distortion or muddyness, clear mids and highs. The ANC and transparency modes are also excellent. You get what you pay for. They sounded toe to toe with my friend's audiophile grade headphones.,I tried the Sony XM4 1000 in the store, they felt like a plastic toy build quality wise after holding the Airpods Max.,Don't get me wrong, Sonys are still very good, but the Airpods Max blow them out of the water build quality wise, and are noticably better sound wise and ANC wise.,Pros:,- Incredible sound, ANC, transparency,Cons:,- Price, you'll probably want to buy another $20-40 worth of accessories like a legit stand and a real travel case
"
Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These headphones are amazing. Steep in price obviously, but nothing compares to the sound quality and noise cancellation these offer. The weight isn’t an issue when I wear them (I have a big head though).,Noise cancellation I have personally experienced and can compare these to are the Bose N25’s, AKG NC60’s, Beats Solo Pros (the ones with the Apple H1 chip I believe), and apples AirPod Pros.,The volume crown takes a little getting used to, but it’s definitely not a deal breaker. My ears stay pretty cool while wearing these too. Plus, I have an industrial piercing that most headphones irritate, but these are comfortable, even with the piercing.,I would definitely recommend.

Seemed like it was coming from everywhere (best way I can explain it).,I did decide to get Apple Care for it, as some people seem to have issues with condensation and sound consistency.,No regrets

  Had an Apple Watch to and thought I was going to notice a big difference going from my Apple Watch seven. The screen scratches just like the older models. Apps run the same.  Disappointed ☹️ but life goes on. Save your money.

  Great watch for the pool.  It is very accurate you need to set the pool length and the watch does the rest. Easy to pause during a break and restart.  It provides data on laps, times and type of swim stroke being used.  Battery life is a little over a day and quick to recharge.  It was easy to set up and pair with the iPhone.  It also displays nest camera video alerts.

  The watch is very nice.  Alert: you MUST have your iPhone at iOS 15.1 in order to pair the series 7 watch.  Also the charger must have the USB-C version, which you must buy separately in order to charge the watch.  It does not come with the watch, order separately because the watch must be full charge for an update. It comes without the most recent update.  I spent 2 hours trying to pair, then talked to Apple Support, that could not help.  Then I read another review to find out it needed iOS 15.1 on the phone.

  I’ve never owned an Apple Watch before so with the price being basically the same as the Series 6 it was a no brained to get this one. I personally love it, I use it every single day. It tracks my fitness, I can see my notifications without needing to take out my phone, look at messages and respond to them. I’ve had no issues with it, it’s been great so far!!

  I have been with Mac for almost 30 years and have found this new one with many problems.  This new computer is not ""user friendly"" anymore and almost everything has to be adjusted in some way.  I spent hours on the phone with apple care just to get it sorted out and then had to take it to the Mac store.  The mouse stopped working, my keyboard as well.  this resulted in my password not being able to work.  Now I only had my old computer which was vastly out of date. I must add that it is now working but I am ready for the next glitch and I hope. I am wrong.  I needed to let you know in my review,

Kashbee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this from Amazon much faster than I would have from the Apple store. I’ve never had a Mac before, so I’m still on a learning curve, but it’s easy to find answers to questions online.  It’s very light weight and would be easy to move to different locations in your house, and connects with WiFi.  All you have to do is plug it in,  The keyboard and mouse charge with a cable, and are set up to connect wirelessly.  The keyboard is ridiculously tiny.  I may get a different one with the numeric pad too.
"
Funkatopia,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased this desktop Mac for the first time (I've had a Macbook Pro laptop for some time) and I figured the desktop will be an even more powerful and stable machine and it's been horrible. To start, i regretfully didn't even start using it until I had had it for a month or so.  It attached itself to my iCloud account from my laptop and immediately downloaded everything that was on my laptop onto the desktop. I really did not want that, but it was fine. Just clutter out of the box. Literally.,But even with a direct connection to the router, the connectivity is very slow and the file processing is even more slow than that. The laptop I have from 2015 is much faster than this new system. I've either made a grave mistake purchasing this model or this is a very defective computer.

  Randomly shutting down and finally did not turn on. It's understandable to get a dud but the worst was getting a replacement or refund less than one week into the return window. Buy from Apple directly. Our money sent the guy to space and yet, they treat us like less than dirt. Lesson learnt!

JLV1028,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I first I thought it was a splurge, but after using it for the past two weeks I now realize my iMac is a must-have! Love the big screen, the clarity is breathtaking and I have room to open several windows simultaneously without the content becoming microscopic. It’s lighting fast, apps open quickly, and while that sounds like a small thing I’m surprised at how much more I can get done. The sound quality is impressive, so is the mic, and I love the Touch ID keyboard -again, little things like typing passwords numerous times each day really add up to a lot of time. I’d been playing with the idea of buying the iMac for ages - SO glad I finally did!

"
Christopher White,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I picked these up on a black Friday deal because my first gen AirPods were starting to go bad after more than three years of hard use. I wear my headphones almost daily while at work or at home working out. The noise cancellation on these headphones are by far one of the best in the industry in my opinion. They also come with multiple sizes of the in-ear rubber tips to make sure you have a comfortable fit.,When using noise cancellation for the first time, you might notice that your ears hurt a little bit. This is a result of the noise cancellation sending negative sound waves to essentially silence all external noises. After a little while you get used to it and the feeling goes away because your ears have gotten used to that noise cancellation. Please note this is nothing to be afraid of, just merely a warning so you don’t feel that you’re going to have long-term issues.,They also work just fine in transparency mode which uses its external microphones to let noise come in so music and play in the background while you’re still aware of your surroundings. I highly recommend these over apples standard AirPods because these have a much more superior sound quality, including a better mid range and bass. My generation one airpod seem to lack bass entirely and resulted in more muffled mids.,In all, I think these are one of the best in ear truly wireless, noise canceling headphones especially if you use exclusively apple products.
"
Virginia Booklover,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First off: Bose QuietComfort over-the-ear phones are, to me, the gold standard for noise cancellation. I splurged on a pair of these several years ago and love, love, love them: their comfort is such that I can wear them all day and forget I've got them on, their battery life stands up to that all-day wear, and they're almost TOO good at the noise cancellation thing (I've had people walk up behind me (at home) and startle me because I did not hear them coming.,But they're awfully bulky - no getting around that! So I thought I'd look into a pair of noise-cancelling wireless earbuds. The AirPods Pro had decent reviews, but they're the sort that stick into your ear canals; I also tried the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, which do not (but also, naturally, had poor ratings for their supposed Active Noise Cancellation).,The Galaxy buds are nice enough, in that they are comfortable, don't require jamming anything into my ear canal (ewwwww!) and come in fun colors. But they fall out if I do anything other than sit in my office chair, and there's really no way to tether them.  The ANC on them is, as expected, a joke, and I don't use that ""feature"".,The AirPods Pro come in any color you like as long as it's white. There ARE ways to make them a bit more secure (anti-loss straps, earhooks) and I've used both of those with mine. The ANC.... at first I thought it did absolutely nothing. Then I found that they DO reduce some kinds of background noise. For example, there's a small fridge in my office. Without them in, I can hear a slight humming. WIth them in, but ANC turned off, there's actually a LOUDER hissing sound. With them in, but ANC turned on, I cannot hear the fridge at all.  Similarly, when someone in the next room is listening to something on the TV, with a door closed between us, I can't hear the TV at all with ANC turned on, and with ANC turned off, I can hear the TV (if slightly muffled).,Long story short: They do reduce some kinds of background noise but will not do anything like the kind of job a good pair of over-the-ear phones will do.,I have not yet had a chance to try these on any kind of transit, due to COVID. The Bose worked quite well for that - I could hear my audiobooks on the train without blasting the volume to dangerous levels. I suspect the AirPods would not work all that well; when I have a chance to try them on a train, I'll come back and update.,Off-label use: my husband wanted a pair of these to use to improve his hearing (there are numerous articles out there about how this sort of earbud can be used as an inexpensive sound booster for those with mild hearing loss).  He tried them, then reported to me that his mouse and keyboard actually make clicking sounds - something he'd genuinely been missing.
"
Summer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was iffy on ordering these due to some of the other comments. But I’m glad I did. They are just as described. Real, authentic Apple airpod pros. The sound quality is very good. But the best feature is the noise cancellation. It’s better than expected. Was delivered in two days (with prime) and the packaging was in perfect condition. Definitely recommend.
"
Kyle,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have ordered these twice. First time the left one came defective, the pressure sensor for touch controls wouldn't work, but then would sporadically spam as if I clicked it at times when I hadn't touched it at all, skipping songs/videos, spamming enabling/disabling noise cancellation and transparency.,I requested a replacement for being defective, the delivery came in an empty box with only the bubble wrap packaging. The box had clearly been opened and resealed with non-Amazon tape, shipping label ripped off. My guess is the Amazon delivery driver stole them, but not certain on that. Contacted Amazon support and they approved a refund.,I will be ordering these from Apple now, not worth my time. When they did work sound quality was great, functions were great, etc.,5/5 for Amazon customer service, 0/5 for delivery and quality of product
"
Oleksandr,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Build quality is way below average Apple product:,- very obvious seam on both pods;,- adhesive remnants on different parts of both pods – had to scrub it off;,- charging case is a little flimsy;,- connection issues with the right pod – fixed after several reconnections.,Overall soud quality is nice.,Good buy during huge discounts, but never for the original price.,Apple has to improve its Quality Control processes.
"
Chicken Crazy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I normally use bone conduction earphones, however, after an ear I jury from flying, I was unable to use them. I borrowed a pair of Airpods to listen to a couple of songs and liked all of the features; however, the Airpods were connected through their Apple phone, which I have an Android. So I ordered a pair; figured I'll return them if I really don't like them.,I tried on all three sizes of the ear tips and found the smalls were most comfortable. The sound quality compared to my bone conduction earphones is remarkable. With the Pods, the sound is richer, it was nice. The noise cancelation feature was something very odd to me. Everytime the feature was in use, my ears felt a lot of pressure and would make my head feel pressure, which is the main reason for returning.,The 2nd reason for returning was the lack of usability without the Apple app specific for these headphones. There are no Android Airpod apps with same functionality as the Apple Airpod app. There are tiny buttons on the Airpods that have some usable features, but if I'm going to pay for a product with features I find worthy, I want the same access to them.,Battery life is very poor. I listen to podcasts and music when I'm busy at home. The Airpods would last about 4 and 1/2 hours straight through.,I'm just going to stick with bone conduction--the technology is improving, and I'm a sucker for open-ear.
"
Gary,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

JCMobile,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was very happy with the first gen air pods. Didn’t think I wanted ones that plugged in my ears. However, after losing one outside for almost 6 months; and then, once found, dropping it into a bucket of paint while doing some yard work, I realized I would very much appreciate AirPods that stayed in place while I did stuff. The noise cancellation is highly effective, even on airplanes. If you’re tired of your AirPods falling out while you’re being active, get these. (SIDE NOTE: My first gen AirPods STILL WORK, despite being submerged in paint for 30 seconds AND being left outside under the gas grill during the rainy season. So those are badass too!!)

Christopher C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple made a bunch of missteps over the course of designing the more recent MacBook Pro computers, most notably the poor keyboards followed by the god-awful Touch Bar. (Props to Apple for trying to innovate and the Touch Bar was a cool idea, but it was a solution that created more problems than it solved.) Eliminating more of the ports on more recent MBPs was also problematic, limiting everything to USB-C/Thunderbolt only, even down to killing the very popular MagSafe power plug. After getting one of those more recent models from my employer for work, I was able to find out first hand just how bad they really are.,This new model reverses SO many of those poor design decisions. MagSafe has returned (while still retaining the ability to also charge over USB-C), the keyboard is far better, the Touch Bar has been eliminated and physical function keys have been brought back to replace it (YAY ESC), and a built-in HDMI port and SD card slot have also returned. As soon as I saw in the release announcement showing off what Apple had done with this machine, I ordered one immediately as I knew this was going to be a perfect replacement for my 2015 MBP - which I'd kept rather than upgrading to the subpar designs mentioned above. I don't regret the purchase at all. This is a fantastic machine.,The only downsides I've experienced are due to the transition to the M1 processor. For 99% of users this won't matter one bit as the performance of the M1 Pro is exceptional. My individual problem is the migration of architecture; moving from x86/x64 to ARM meant instantly losing the ability to run VirtualBox and VMWare. VirtualBox will likely never run on the M1 architecture, and while VMWare is working on a new ARM version and Parallels is also available, they only allow for virtualization of ARM guest systems. Good enough for ARM builds of Linux (and limited versions of Windows), but Intel virtualization is now dead on the Mac. Again, this is not something that most people will ever run into, but for me it's a bit of an inconvenience. The trade-offs, however, are worth it.

  M1 Pro performance is mind-blowing! The laptop boots up out of sleep in a second, just as fast as you unlock your iPhone but it's a laptop. The display is absolutely gorgeous, the color is pretty accurate. The black is very deep and you can't discriminate a black produced by monitor and a natural black!!,The battery life is the highest I've ever seen!!! It can easily, EASILY endure for a day. I highly recommend this beast for pro users.

  On day 3 of using this beast and wow. It’s insane.,I’m a videographer and am always editing and exporting videos. My Mac before this was the i9 and this thing completely blows it away.,I shoot on a Sony FX6 camera and most computers have trouble with the footage and editing it (just the codec). This computer has no problem at all. Kinda crazy.,4 stars because I had one problem with performance (it was not performing how it normally did) but restarting it fixed it.,Will update after months of use. But so far - best purchase I’ve made. If you use a computer everyday and performance matters. This is a no brainer.,Oh and thanks apple for bringing back old stuff (mag safe and ports) and calling it “new”.

  Clarity of the screen and improved speed were offset, for me, with a lack of a USB port, no DVD port, and still no compatibility with some apps that I would use. For me, I ended up having to buy an adapter for other devices which revealed that with the adapter plugged in I could not attach the power cord.,I need to point out that I am NOT a power user and most interested in memory & storage capacity, screen size clarity, and speed. I recommend that one  really look at what you are going to use your computer for and see how the computer meets those needs versus cost. I bought the MacAir Pro Max with M1 chip. For my fit I rate it a B+/A-.

  There’s nothing to dislike about this laptop. It’s fast, the graphics are INSANE, it runs so many applications at once flawlessly. It’s better than I had hoped for. Price was a bit scary at first but we use it for my wife’s photography business and Photoshop/Lightroom work perfectly without issue and the quality of the machine is well worth the price. Honestly considering a second one to replace my HP.

  I have been a pc user my entire life and took the plunge into the apple platform with this 16 MacBook Pro and it is simple bliss. The speed is mind blowing, the screen beautiful, I can not find anything bad to say.  You should get a shell case to keep safe (as seen in photos) I got the base model and am happy as can be with it, I think if I had gotten the more spec out model my head may have exploded.  I am now convinced that on judgement day that when god looks for my name in the big book he will do it on a MacBook Pro.  :)

  The macbook is really a fantastic machine. The only thing really holding the mac back, is the price. Its just way too expensive for a lot of people, not even a good gift consideration because of that. You could make one of the most powerful PCs with the money it cost to buy one of these. That being said, why bother buying it? Well if you really enjoy mac os, there is one reason. I can’t think of too many though. Its a good machine, just not worth the money it costs.

manuel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've returned these. If I wasn't an Android guy and was deep into the Apple ecosystem, I would absolutely love to keep them, but I'm not, so I won't. The build quality is next level, and the ear cups are the most comfortable and breathable of any headset I've used. It's lack of full functionality on Android and Windows gives the impression that Apple doesn't want non-Apple fans, which is very anti-consumer. Bundle that with the insane asking price, and I think, on principal, I shouldn't give them my money. I do wish other companies made products as nice as Apple, at least in terms of hardware.
"
Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Considering how things have changed with stores selling audio products, it's not possible to go into a store to buy headphones and 'compare' a variety of headphones to decide which you like best. So, I purchased the Bose NC 700 Headphones, Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones, and Apple AirPod Max Headphones all in the span of three months. The clear winner in all categories.... Apple AirPod Max.,1. Superior, clear, crisp, sound with spatial separation of vocals and instrumentation.,2. Easily connects to all Apple products (computers, iPads, iPods, and also to LG TV;s, and Dell Computers.,3. Very comfortable in feel on the sides of the head, over the ears, and snug fit on top of head.,4. Noise cancellation is like BAMN!! No sound outside the headphones period. But also is adjustable.,5. Snug fit, cushy ear pads, with deep pockets to encase ears with space for audio to surround the listener.,6. Controls are few, creative & unique, and function well.,7. The headphones look and feel of top quality, and professional sturdy.,8. Uh... did I mention they sound Great!!!,If you love to hear, and feel, all the intricacies and nuances music you listen too, this is the best purchase.,UPDATE: 28 Dec. 2021,I have come to learn that this headset is also a complete extension of your iPhone. What does that mean? When you say ""Hey Siri"" you can ask anything that you would ask if you were talking directly into your phone. i.e. ""Hey Siri"" increase volume, decrease volume, next song, prior song, send email, send text, what time is it, and any questions you would ask Siri when researching something on the web. It can and will notify you of text messages you receive as well as emails if you have chosen the settings for it to do so. It gets no better than this.
"
C. Milano,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are some of the best wireless headphones I’ve every used, and the perform better than the Sony XM4, and Sennheiser PXC 550.  The noise cancelling is great, the transparency mode is the best I’ve ever used.  These pair and work seamlessly with multiple apple devices, as long as Windows isn’t involved.,BUT… moisture condenses inside the aluminum earcups and make the headphones stop working.  I’m on my second pair and pushed through August/September with daily resets.  Now that humidity levels are down, they have started working again.  But until apple addresses this issue, or you live in a very dry climate, stay away.
"
BobHOKC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m not sure where to begin.  I have owned a number of excellent headphones, in the past, but this one is truly the gold standard.  The comfort and fit are second to none, tone quality is unbelievable, bass & treble are perfect, and intelligent noise cancellation is out of this world.  On top of all this, it is the perfect headset for those of us who wear hearing aids.  I had read reviews by a number of people wearing premium Beltone hearing aids, who did not have to remove them, to hear well with the AirPods Max, and were thrilled to death with the “partnership” … I am now one of those people, as well!  In a word … W O W!
"
Scottyb06,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've been using my Bowers & Wilkins and V-Moda M100 Master's for a few years now, and these Apple Air Pod Max headphones are indeed much better. I bought them for only $430, which brings the price pretty close to B&W's. These headphones are very high quality, sound amazing (especially with Dolby Atmos tracks), and provide fantastic simulated surround sound with my Apple TV movies and shows. It is unfortunate that you still need to buy an actual case for these headphones, as the little rubber ""case"" Apple provides is pretty much useless.
"
Christopher Udell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So I seem to experiment with headphones.  Over ear, in ear, on ear, etc.  I must have bought more than 12 sets of different products over the last 3-4 years.  These sound fine.  Not blown away as I was hoping, but maybe I was hoping for something that doesn’t exist.  No issues with comfort at all.  I could keep these on my head for hours and would not be bothered.  I have had some sync issues, and I primarily only use Apple devices.  Though mostly with my Mac.  Each time I have used them, I have had to remove them from my Mac Bluetooth registry and add over again.  No problems with my iPads.  Ironically, my Acer Predator will automatically recognize them, even when they are on a different floor in the house.  Oh, and I’m surprised by how many headsets make it unnecessarily difficult to adjust volume on the headset itself.  Not so with this set.
"
Escalante,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Noise cancellation is by far the best out there in wireless headphones. Sound quality is nice too.,The only problem I have with these is their easy to scratch up. Already have a few scratches on the iodized aluminum surface. Ruins the look. Otherwise, they’re great if you can stomach half a brand.
"
Anonymous,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is an absolutely crucial purchase if you work in a shared space (crowded coffee shop), fly for longer than 30 minutes, or if you just appreciate hearing the nuances of a song.  I was hesitant to buy them after reading about the condensation issue but I’ve worn them now for several weeks and have only seen condensation once, which came during a marathon writing session.  The carrying case is a joke but if you’re spending this much for headphones, I suppose you know how to take care of nice things.,Buy the headphones, you won’t regret them.
"
Shep - Memphis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered the Bose top-of-the-line heaphones and found the sound was really good, but the controls were hard to work because there were no knobs. I have to swipe or rub the headphones to answer calls or work rthe volume. There were no marks or etching on the headphones to indicate where, just on the instruction booklet. I tried and tried to figure it out but got frustrated and returned them. The Soney took-of-the-line were easier to use, but they did not sync with all my apple products and when they did, I would have to reconnect them every time I used them, sdo I returned them. Then I went to the most expensive route - the Apple AirMax headphones and I must say these sound great, the volume knob works easily and is multi-function - and it switches seamlessly between all my Apple products. Best of all, I can watch TV in bed and my wife can't hear anything. I got tired of looking for my little Air pods in the morning. More importantly, when I travel I won't have to worry about dropping my airpods in the plane and having to search for them PLUS they never did fit right.  I love the Apple AirMax headphones.
"
Bart Not Simpson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality of these headphones is great. The noise cancelling feature is amazing. I love letting other people try it out just to see the look on their faces. There are however 2 things that bother me about these headphones. First, it feels like they are squeezing my ears and head too tight. Second, my ears get really hot after having them on for more than 30 minutes. The combination of my ears getting hot and my head being squeezed causes me to only use them for short periods of time. Otherwise, I'd use them a lot more often.

  The 12-month installment payment will NEVER happen. And it could be even worse than you think. A quick fact is that I got deducted for the WHOLE amount in August (I adjusted the autopayment immediately in July at Synchrony bank to the promised installment payment after I decided to keep the iMac). The reason? The bank said that if you make changes in July for the auto payment amount it will come into effect in September. So, no matter what you do, you would be charged the whole amount in August if you previously chose to autopay the statement balance. A huge bug here. After 2 hours phone call, the bank agents said the only way they could do was to send this $1500 by REGULAR MAIL WITHOUT TRACKING number. Wish me good luck. By the way, don't call the customer service at Synchrony bank unless you have at least 2 hours to get angry and are willing to give them the opportunity to ruin your rest of the day. If I can give stars for the payment method, I would give Synchrony bank a 0.

  this iMac  fits nicely in between the old 21 and 27.  the new chip made in-house  is a nice feature.  I have an older I Mac that I love.  I am not a gamer at all, but speed is still important.  could have bought the  intel 7 gen. and been happy just the same.  I do not have or need a ""smart phone"".  my only problem was in the delivery.  I pay for prime .  item was promised and in stock.  7 days later, item was dropped on porch.  no signature was asked for .  Best Buy had for same price.  could have walked in and had in hands.  . if you choose amazon, make arrangements for pick up.  2 grand is a lot  to leave to chance.  overall I still say buy this one.  I am gonna get another soon.

  Bought for xmas and when transferring data from an OLD 17 inch mac book, I ran out of storage on this brand new 24 inch 2021 desktop! I did not take this into account as I assumed such a newer device will hold all my data from a very old mac. I don't have a lot of data either, so this was not good. Wish I had bought from apple direct to customize the storage needed. It looks great though and is much faster.
"
Jennifer Bordeaux,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These do not fit in my ears at all. I used to have the 2nd generations and they fit perfectly in my ears but they stopped working. These however hurt my ears really bad and continue to fall out because they are so big. I really wish I would not have bought these so trust me, if you’re going to spend this much money, just get the pros. (or second generation, I have no complaints about those).
"
S. Kahler,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had AirPod 1’s, 2’s, and now 3’s. Other than battery life over the 2’s I do NOT recommend them.

I wish I could exchange mine.

"
Laidback Llama ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter who wanted an upgrade from her gen 1 AirPods, and all I can really say is…WOW, just WOW… the noise canceling factor is obviously a game changer in and of itself, however, in my opinion, the sound quality is the single most impressive quality of these gen 3’s. Good bass depth, crisp and really well balanced treble and tone. Battery life could be better, but the MagSafe charging capability makes charging anywhere, anytime a breeze! Well worth the money!
"
JORGE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the first gen Airpods and decided to buy 3rd gen, never had a problem with the 1st gen falling out of my ear. The 3rd gen both ear buds fall out of my ear when I talk and work out other then that quality and sound is on point. Returned the the 3rd gen and bought the Pros and they do not fall out of my ear and the noise cancelation is a plus. Hope this helps!
"
Federico,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bougth this airpods to upgrade my Airpods Gen 2.  My first feeling was ""Is big for my ears"" but after a couple of weeks i got used to it.  I also had the feeling the Airpods were going to fall down but they stay even when i run.  Great sound and battery life.  The reason i don't give it 5 star is because i still feel some discomfort when i used for long periods of time.  However, i haven't found any other better.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the airpod 2nd generation before these. Used to wear them all day non-stop and would actually forget I was wearing them. These 3rd gens hurt my ears after about an hour and fall out easy.,Side note: they fall out of the case easily if you have the lid open. The 2nd gens had to be physically pulled out. These just come out if your opening the lid and hold them any other way than perpendicular to Earth.
"
Don,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As others have mentioned, this new shape doesn't stay in like the older models. I've never had an issue with the Airbud shape and have loved my Airpods gen 1 since they released. Looks like I'll be sticking with those.,If you're lucky and they do fit your ears, the sound quality is definitely a boost from gen 1. Bummed they aren't for me.
"
Kina,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was debating between these and the 2nd Gen; decided on this 3rd Gen. It has great sound quality and instantly connects to my phone and iPad; however it’s really uncomfortable. It falls out of my ear really quickly and when it does stay in (forcibly), it hurts after a short time. The ear piece is bigger than the other generations which is the cause of the problem. The 1st and 2nd Gen fits more snuggly and comfortably in my ear. This one is just big. Sounds great overall tho, only downfall is size of ear piece.
"
Elizabeth P.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Out of the box they paired up to my iPhone very easily and worked fine for 3 days. First use on day 4, the left earbud had no sound at all, right one worked as normal.,I went onto the Apple website to troubleshoot. During this process I had to have my phone ""Forget the Device / Airpods"" and try to pair again. Then the AirPods would not pair to any phone at all.,Ended up chatting with a tech and after an hour with them they gave up and told me to return / exchange for new ones.,Aside from the obvious issue, when they were working they were good. The battery life isn't all that great but they charge quickly in the case. Hopefully the replacement pair lasts longer than this one.
"
Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I debated between these headphones and the Sony WF-1000XM4's.  Both are well reviewed.  The Airpod Pro's are priced lower and looked less intrusive.  I am VERY satisfied with the Airpod Pro's.  They are so comfortable to wear, they sit very securely in my ears but don't become uncomfortable even with hours of use. The noise canceling is incredible, including the Transparency mode which allows for conversation.  The spatial sound feature makes the music sound like it's in front of you and is very natural sounding - not gimmicky.  The Apple engineers and designers really nailed this one.,I use them mostly with my iPhone but they paired up with my Surface Book computer just fine and sound awesome with it as well.,Only negative, and it's minor, is there are no volume controls on the earphones. This turns out to not be less of problem than I thought it might because once you set the volume, with the noise canceling, you don't need to adjust them, and you can leave the volume at an ear saving level. The AirPod Pro's don't need to be turned up loud to sound good.  Love these things and can't believe I put up with less for so long.
"
Walter D. Peek,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These sound great and are very comfortable.  I can wear them for hours and not know they are in my ears. Eventhough they don't lock in, they feel very secure and have not popped out, even when jogging.  They were easy to pair, including with my apple watch 7.  I like being able to control the volume, seeing song titles and skipping songs from my watch. I testing the noise reduction in my home office blasting Jet Engine white noise, they are not quite as good as my wired Bose QuietComfort 20, but close enough.  But have not tried them on an actual plane yet.  The passthough works well.  I thought the spacial audio sounded a little better on than off for music.  It sounded a little fuller, but did not try it on movies formated for it, and probably will not.  Hey Siri works great.  My one complaint is that I cannot control the volume when paired to my FireTV Cube.  I was hoping to use these in bed when my spouce is sleeping next to me.  I could not adjust the volume with my iphone, apple watch, or using Siri.  I ended up buying a $20 pair of Tozo A1s with built in audio controls.
"
Brandy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have little issue with the headphones as they are. I wish the battery lasted longer, but they work as advertised. I realize it’s not uncommon for headphones to not come with a charger adapter (although every pair I’ve ever bought did), these come with a charging cord that has Apple plug on one end and USB-Type C on the other. These adapters are not common, meaning if I want to use that cord I have to big a new adapter, approx $20. Or have a useless cord.
"
Scott Shelburne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve been meaning to replace my old AirPods for a year now. The battery life was ending… I kept shopping for all different Earbuds, reading reviews, and asking friends and finally broke down and decided to try the most expensive, but best reviewed earbuds, AirPods Pro.,You bet 100% that I made the absolute right decision!!! These are amazing!!! First is the fit! You barely notice them in your ears, which I areas other earbuds can get uncomfortable after a while. Second is the sound!!! The Spacial Audio of the Pros is incredible and 3x the quality of my old AirPod 2s!!! Third is ease of use. I used to have adaptors that I’d put on and take off the old AirPods because they would fall out of my ears without. They also sync so easily with my iPhone and I’ve yet to have any Bluetooth interference which my old AirPods would often cut out and skip for who knows why.,I got the Pros at $179 off Amazon during the Christmas sale season. They are now back to $199, but I would pay it if I had to!!!,AirPods Pro’s are absolutely the best earbuds ever!!! Especially a must if you have an iPhone.

Giovanni L. Recchia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these Air Pods Pro earbuds because they were being sold on Amazon for just a few dollars more than the Air Pods 3rd gen, but I really did not need the noise cancellation feature (which I have not even tested, as I use them in very low noise environments). Compared to other earbuds I owned before, including a pair of Beats, the sound quality of the Air Pods Pro is just amazing to me (but I am not a fanatical audiophile). They are also extremely easy to pair with my iPhone and they fit my ears perfectly, especially after experimenting with different sizes of ear tips, using the testing feature provided with the iPhone. I ended up with medium size tip in the left ear and large size in the right ear (I guess I am not perfect after all :-). Battery life is not spectacular, but more than adequate for me, especially with the recharging case they come with. Just like with most Apple products I have ever owned, I recommend these Air Pods Pro.
"
Paul W. Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Apple AirPods Pro are a definite step up from the regular AirPods, stay in your ears well (the Beats Fit Pro does slightly better here, but the microphone is not as good as on the AirPods Pro), have good noise cancellation (Bose and Sony might be a tad better, but these are very good), and excellent microphone pickup.  If you are going to be in a loot of phone calls, eMeetings (Zoom, Webex, Facetime, etc.) these are very much the ones to get.  About the only thing these are not good for would be high head movement activities (athletics), there the Beats Fit Pro does better, but these are on a par or better than the competitive Sony or Bose variants (which are larger, so easier to dislodge).  Also, once paired with Apple devices, you can just move them around to be used with whatever you happen to be doing, iPad or iPhone or MacBook, they autoswitch, don't have to be re-paired, and also handle Siri commands.

  The Apple Watch is different from my old Fitbit. I’m getting used to the larger size. I like the customizable face and what you can access from it. I like that I can answer calls and texts messages from it if I’m away from my phone.,Wish the battery lasted more than a day. Oh well.

  I went from a very old apple watch to this one so there was like fireworks and stuff going off in my head !!  It's a great watch for the price !!  All new fabulous features, much longer battery life and it even does an EKG !!!  No heart problems here according to my watch, thank goodness !

  I got this for my husband and he loves the watch, however the band will come undone at times and he has almost lost it a few time because of this. Overall he likes that almost everything he can do on his phone he can also do on the watch. I like that it measures vitals and steps it has great user interface and so far has been a hit.

  I thought watches were outdated until I bought a fit bit for fitness tracking in less than a year my desire grew for more fitness data and I added swimming to my routine. I bought an Apple Watch  series 3 exactly 3 years ago. Loved it, passed it onto my daughter and upgraded to the 7 series. I absolutely love these watches. The 7 is easier to use, if that’s even possible and the battery life is much much better than my 3. If you’re a first time buyer or looking to upgrade I highly suggest this one!

  This is a considerable upgrade from my previous Apple Watch (Series 3). I decided to get the 41 mm instead of the 45 mm, and I am delighted with the watch's size. The display is vibrant, and it does a great job of logging my workouts. I would recommend this watch.

  I’ve had my eye on an Apple Watch for the past couple of years but this time I finally decided to get one. I love it so much and I am so happy I went with the 7 over the SE. I got the new starlight color which I really like because the champagne color can go with yellow gold, rose gold, and silver bands.

Parrish A Whalen,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been wanting one of these for a while. I decided to take the plunge. For the price you pay for these things I would expect a way to charge the watch. I get the charge craddle but not the wall charger. Apple uses a very small usb port so it does not work with ""Normal"" USB ports. So now I guess I have to spend yet more money to get the wall charger! or I just may return it.

  I've been working so far one month with this laptop and by far is the best one I've used. It does not make any sound (using the same kind of edition and programming apps with an intel 2019 version, which is quite noisy). It does not heat neither. The only pitfall so far I've seen is that still after 1 year of having ARM based processors, some apps still are not natively compatible and it requires Rosetta 2. It definitely worth it.

  I would not recommend purchasing these AirPod Max headphones.. These are not New but used.. First indication was the packaging which was missing.. Nothing like how Apple ships the product.  When I connected them a few moments ago the person's name who previously owned them showed up in my settings on iPhone so they were not even reset..
"
Beech01,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They're expensive. That said, there can be a connection issue in which my desktop repeatedly drops and reconnects then drops the connection again. This is irritating and since the max cannot be turned off, it is necessary to reset by depressing the crown and that other button. This can be hit or miss, I solved the problem, strangely, by turning on an iphone, which seemed to connect the max to the desktop. Circular wizardry. Got the latest firmware update. But, they are tremendously cool. Volume is crisp, build is sturdy and clean, except for the connectivity, 5+ stars.
"
Josh M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excessive price, heavy, ridiculous case. But currently my favorite headphones. They are the most comfortable headphones I have (and I have quite few), they sound really good. The noise cancellation isn't as good as Bose or the top end Sony's, but they are good enough and the comfort of wearing them makes up for most of that.
"
Timothy L. Truster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love them!  Pulled them out of the box, they auto synced to my iPhone and I was jamming.  Like the sound quality in fact I have heard details in songs I did not hear with earbuds.  The fit is a bit more relaxed than other over ear headphones I’ve used in the past, so they don’t pinch  when wearing them, but that means my gyration have to be scaled back a bit as I dance around cord free.  I’ve left my phone on my desk and gotten at least 100 feet away before starting to lose signal/breakup. 👍

"
Vlad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The headphones are good, noise cancellation works as supposed, with a bit of pressure so you do feel it as a bit of extra pressure. I liked new clarity mode. The headset jumps between devices as it should. One caveat is that you can only switch NC or Clarity on Android devices.,Sound qualuty is great, resolution, surround, volume, it' s all good.,The cons.,The headphones are heavy, but they do last for a 20+hour trip with NC.,I was not able to make my lightning connector work with a 3,5mm jack - so no on flight entertaiment (tried two cords with endless devices. No luck),Case looks good on a desk, terrible in everyday use,Ergonomics - super comfortable on your head, but terrible if you try to carty the on yohr neck.,Overall - a mixed feeling, it's a great headphones, but I'm not completely giving up my other geadphones due to their light weight and ergonomics.
"
John Santmann,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The noise cancelling is very good and pairing to an iPhone is simple.,Problem is that the fidelity is not very good. The fidelity of my first generation air pod ear buds is really excellent, MUCH better than the AirPod Max. The AirPod Max has a muffled quality and an overactive bass. Sounds like I'm listening through a pillow.
"
V. Romero,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love apple products and jumped on the opportunity to have these.,First impression..looks amazing and sharp. The audio quality is great as well.,My dislikes…they are rather heavy and expected when the outer shell is made of the same metal that the back of iPhones. The noise cancelling is not as expected when compared to my air pods pro and my other Sennheiser PXC 550 headphones.,The case it came with is not what I consider a travel case and apple could do better with that.,Initially they felt great but noticed the pressure it started placing on the rear jaw area within 5 min of wearing these headphone and as previously stated, I didn’t like the weight.
"
Ryan King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m a little bit crazy when it comes to headphones. I currently have 26 sets, adding and trading constantly. The air pod max punch WAY higher than their price would suggest. While $500 for a set is quite expensive for a lot of people, I own headphones that cost $800, $950 and $1100 that don’t compare as favorably. By far the best noise canceling I’ve experienced as well.

G. Coleman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not a fan. I bought this to grade papers and write a book. What I found was an overly expensive iPad that lacks the functionality of my old iPad, 10inch-ish, that's heavy with a deficient screen.,My old iPad was lighter, more comfortable to hold, and easier to pack away in my backpack.,This 12.9 iPad is huge and heavy, making it inconvenient to use, which is exactly what the iPad was designed NOT to be.,And why is their no 1/8th inch jack? This thing is the size and weight of a house. You'd think they could put a measly 1/8 inch jack for those of us who record, podcast, etc.,Additionally, I bought the keyboard. Again, too expensive, cumbersome, and lackluster. For a keyboard as large as the MacBook Air, the iPad12.9 is strange. Basic functionality is lost.  Example it lacks the top keyboard of the Air: volume, escape, search, microphone, etc. Also, it's too heavy and big.,To me, it seems the better choice is a MacBook Air or an “iPad Air at 12.9” inches--if it should ever be made. Grading papers is a slavish thing. You want some thing that's easy to hold, look at, and interact with. The iPad 12.9 shows Apple getting out of touch with what made them great, great design. The 12.9"" iPad pro's weight, lackluster keyboard, cumbersome handling, and cost make it a deal breaker.,Apple, do better.

  Apple do not joke that the next computer is not a computer,,now with the M1 chip, this tablet is a beast that can run all your creative suites and more.,The only downside is the battery life,,not that 10 hours isn't good, but it could have been better as the MacBook M1 features a 16 hours battery life.
"
Jasonc506,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first iPad and I love it so far. I am upgrading from a galaxy tab s4 and the difference is staggering. Everything is so snappy and gaming runs great. I have tried a lot of apps and content on it with absolutely no problems. I’m sure this thing is a bit overkill for me right now but I wanted something with a good future. Honestly I am not sure that the screen is that amazing considering the hype but it does look great. It is a bit difficult adjusting from Android to IOS but no big issues. I live in an area with pretty much no internet so I bought the 5G model. There is no 5G around here so I can’t comment on it, but the 4g runs good. The brightness is a nice selling point, it is much easier to see out in the sun than my last tablet. My only issue with the 12.9 iPad is a lack of good cases right now but I’m sure more will come soon. I am not exactly a power user but after years of suffering from the sluggish performance on android, especially in regards to gaming, I wanted a big upgrade. Apple Arcade seems quite nice so far for people who like gaming too.
"
Tobywan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Upgraded from an IPad Pro 2 and this thing is a BOAT ANCHOR compared to the 2, particularly with a magic keyboard. Seriously, it is just a few ounces less than a Mac Book. Battery power is terrible also. Went from 100% to 60% during a two hour meeting using just Evernote and email with 25% brightness. Agree with other reviewers on screen bloom (very pronounced in darkness) and the fact that you can’t use all that power with the current IOS. Lotta swiping still.,Would not have bought it if I knew all this.
"
Ren,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don’t know how anyone could possibly rate this less than 5 stars.  I have the 2020 iPad Pro 11inch and just upgraded to the 12.9 inch with XDR display.  This thing is a total beast like one buyer commented.  The screen is absolutely beautiful and the speed is crazy fast.  Waiting for more accessible apps and better folder management so I can ditch my MacBook Pro!  Either way I LOVE this device and will keep it for years to come!
"
John Moran,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  $1,000 tablet with a blooming display. I dont care if this is a ""side effect"", this is the top of the top, and its not cheap. Even the menus have blooming. There is all this talk about HDR being 1600 Nits and how bright it gets, I literally can barely tell the difference between this and my tab s7+ when it comes to brightness (600 nits). The worst offender is how swuare this thing is. Being this weird aspect ration means you will have huge black bars. Youtube videos literally look the same size on my tab s7+ which is almost half an inch smaller in width.

Gyro gearloos,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Having had iPads since gen 1 this is the worst of the bunch from a general use standpoint.,No button to press so every time you try to do something you either try 3 or 4 or more times or wait and sometimes it will timeout and give you the prompt for pin.,After having it for about 6 months I’ve gone to a Samsung tablet and happy now.,It shouldn’t be frustration trying to deal with the device when you just want to get things done, play a game, or listen to music.,Then there’s the price!,Apple, you’re a joke compared to 10 years ago.,New M1 hardware will eventually stop shining and you’ll be back to being judged on the actual product and service.,Oh, wait, it’s Apple. Never mind, the fan bois will support you.,Selling mine to a friend who has nothing right now.

  This is my first Mac, and so far so good.,I’ve always had an iPhone since iPhone 3 (I think), and also have an iPad. Therefore I’m very familiar with iOS, so setting up the Mac was a breeze. However, I’ve only ever used Microsoft PC’s in the past, so switching from Windows to the Mac interface is a lil tricky at first. I’m slowly getting it, but liking it all so far.,If you’re already an iOS person, you’ll love a Mac. I do so far, and will probably never go back to PC (but one should never say never).,Cheers!

"
Trevor,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So the sound quality of these are really good! The noise cancellation feature is pretty impressive - there’s a wall unit ac at work where I tested it. I sat next to the unit with the fan humming and blowing quite loudly and turned on noise cancellation and *nothing*. During this same time, someone was standing next to me inches away and saying my name and it sounded faintly, like it was 20 feet away.,The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is, even with the small tips in use, I had to keep adjusting both AirPods when I had them in while grocery shopping.
"
John K.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Of course there's going to be some limitations with a battery so small, especially when using intense functions like noise cancelling.  However, the battery life of the ear pods are nowhere near as long as half the battery life of the phone.  You will need to be near a charger, and it's too bad you cannot use your phone's built-in wireless charger to charge up the AirPods in a pinch.  I love the sound quality and noise cancellation.  HOWEVER, noise is ONLY being cancelled for you, and your caller on the other end will very loudly hear every single little background noise on your end even when you can't.  This is quite an aggravating mode of operation.  Since that noise is being cancelled for you and you cannot hear it, you're oblivious and make even more background noise.  If you're outside, you won't be annoyed by wind noise, but your caller will hear it amplified.
"
emre Lee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  EDIT: After contacting Amazon for this issue, they offered me a replacement or refund, I went with refund. Bad part of the story is I canI have go thru all that jazz for to risk another used item. I will go for new version when it comes out from Apple Store.,ORIGINAL REVIEW:,I ordered a new AirPods Pro alongside with 3d printer related products and some finehair brushes.. All came in good shape except the Airpods Pro..,FIRST: Package had no stretch film on it to peel off. it was an open box with some dents, scratches and some stains on them ( as seen on pictures),SECOND: When I took the AirPod Pro's out surface had scratch marks and eartips had some dirt on them as well as the charging case. Also hinge had some dents too,THIRD: the earphones made from two parts in production.. there are seams/connection points of those parts on the device which should be barely visible.. In this device it looks like the earphones were disassembled before cause I can clearly see the parts are not well aligned on each earphone. You can clearly see those misaligned assembly surface error on the images.,AND LASTLY: when I try to connect the device to my iPhone. it showed it as ""Theresa's AirPod Pros"" on my device list.,This is a used item, sold by amazon as brand new, it can be even stolen item so far I can not know what the heck Amazon do here.,Horrible service so far.
"
Katrina W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I tried to not order these. Went through several pairs of cheaper ear buds. Finally went ahead and ordered these. Extremely impressed. First, noise cancellation is astounding. I have an air purifier running at all times and I put these on and thought I had kicked the cord with my foot and turned the air purifier off—nope! Just completely silent. I can still hear people speaking and my dog bark but it is at a reduced volume. But things like that air purifier hum are completely erased. Second, sound quality is out of this world. Crystal clear and perfect strong bass. Also listening to people talk on zoom sounds like they are in the room with you. I just purchased them so I have no input on battery life etc. But so happy with the product, wish I would have ordered them first and not went through frustrations with cheaper ones.
"
anonymous,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Best headset for having conversations on your phone. I’ve tried many brands of the same price range. These do not rank the highest in terms of comfort X or sound quality, but if you’re trying to have a conversation on your iPhone without annoying wind and background noise for the person you’re on the phone with, these are far superior to any other brand. They keep popping out of my ears, which is annoying. The good news is that the sound stops if you’re listening to music so that you know that you’ve lost one of the earpieces. It would be nice if you could adjust volume with the earpieces like other brands  Volume has to be controlled on the phone not the earpiece. It’s very easy to answer the phone for an incoming call without having to touch the earpiece or the phone. Just tell it to “answer”, and you are connected!
"
Mike in MI,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Rarely in today’s world of over inflated claims of product performance have I purchased a product that actually overachieved its hype.,I’ve been an avid audiophile for over 40yrs. and have purchased and used a huge variety of higher end speakers, sound systems, head phones and ear pods over that period of time.,The iPod pro ear pods produce a quality as sophistication of sound equal to over-ear headphones costing double the price or more. They easily compare to it surpass the performance of Stienhour, Sony, and Bose, wired, over the ear headphones that I’ve used in the past.,They are adjustable for fit and comfort. Very unobtrusive and intuitive to use. The battery life and charging time appear to be more than adequate for the 3-4 hour listening sessions that I use them for as I work.,These were a solid value at the $249 list price. I purchased mine on sale for $199 and now I’ve seen them advertised for as low as $159.,This really is a “must buy” for anyone looking for a high quality portable headphone solution.
"
Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  You have to have had a few wireless ear-buds to appreciate how many orders of magnitude better this product is compared to others.,The Siri integration is fantastic.  The touch/force button works great. The receiving sound is perfectly clear, and enhanced by the noise cancellation. And the mic quality appears to be good, have had many conversations without issue.,The normal AirPods were good too, but they fell out of my ear too much.  These sit better in my ear, and stay in longer without issue.,There is still concern that something so expensive can be lost.  But for a few months it has been safe.,Obviously don’t get this product if you only use Android.,Also, some irritation with my other apple devices automatically connecting to these.

knit wit,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered with Prime on November 25 and was supposed to receive delivery by November 27. After Amazon lost track of the delivery, some back and forth with Amazon customer service, posting a negative review on November 29 and canceling and re-ordering through customer service, my original order mysteriously arrived December 1. That required me to contact customer service again to cancel the replacement order. For all of the rigamaroll with Amazon, I deducted a point. While the Black Friday price made some hassle worthwhile, it shouldn’t be required. Amazon should just do what they say they will do. If you need a week for delivery, tell me you need a week. Don’t promise me 2 day delivery.,That said, the airbuds seem excellent so far. Good for calls, podcasts and comfy. They arrived already charged so I was able to start using them right away. Like other Apple products, they pretty much set themselves up.

  Having read all the negative reviews I wanted to let people know what my out of the box experience was. So no bubble wrap. The AirPods box just flipped and tossed around on it’s trip to my porch. Maybe some padding next time Amazon please. I purchased these from amazon bc the price was better. People were saying other peoples names popped up when they went to connect implying they are refurbished. This DID NOT happen to me, and it simply said “connect AirPods Pro”. Next people were claiming these are knock offs because it says made in Vietnam and not China. So this is actually the first year (2021) that apple started making products (AirPods/AirPods pro) in Vietnam, so as to not rely so heavily on Chinese firms. These are not a knock off. As for quality and sound. I will get back to you on that. Hope this helps!

"
alberto martinez,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The spatial audio feature sounds great but you have to re enable it all the time , for me the deal braker was that they don’t . Have the noise cancelling and eliminated the tapping feature now is this tiny press switch that you have to find it without looking and they are not pr be ogramable, the size of the bulb is too thick and for me and my wife they fell from the ear with little effort, so i returned them and went back to airpods second generation.
"
Eric,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The airpods themselves work great --> a wonderful upgrade from the previous model. I find that these actually fit better within my ear, and the bass on these are phenomenal (primary reason I upgraded).,My problem was purchasing a ""Used - Like New"" copy. The owner before me didn't disconnect the airpods from their profile, causing my phone to constantly warn me that this unknown device had an owner who could see my movement anytime I carried them with me.,I'll be returning them and getting a brand new (hopefully) pair. Just ridiculous that Amazon quality is this low; did you even try and connect them? Or even worse, did you connect them as part of the QA process and not disconnect them?,Bad practices, Amazon. At least you're consistent.
"
Grant Goodyear,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These were supposed to be an upgrade from my first gen, which they are audio-wise when they actually work properly. Sound and features are good. Disappointed that they cut out frequently. Every so often only one airpod will connect. Sometimes one will drain battery much faster. The fit seemed to be fine and after some use my left ear became very sore and I realized that my left airpod was not streamlined where two pieces of the plastic connect and it was cutting my skin.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I would like to start off saying they sound a whole lot better then the first generation AirPods. The bass is a lot more prominent than pervious generations. Although I give it a four star because they do not fit in my ear because of their larger size. So with that being said people with smaller ears like me beware. Although I would like to mention that if you have larger or average size ears you should be fine and I 100% recommend these AirPods.

"
Vera Paoletti,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded from the original airpods and got these,  there is definitely a difference with the sound quality. The only problem is the size. They are very big and keep falling out of my ears. They get uncomfortable and somewhat hurt after a few minutes. I will most likely return and get the airpod pros for more comfort
"
DaTruth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love these!!! I wear them all the time. I still haven't learned how to tap them for whatever im trying to do, but it stops and starts the music just like I need em too! 😂 I've had them for a few months now and they still work great. Good battery life, great sound quality, noise canceling, and comfortable in my ear.
"
Tanner taylor,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I guess these things only fit a certain type of ear? If not, these other reviews saying they work great haven’t had a lot of earbud experience, I would definitely compare them to something you’d buy at Walmart for like 20 bucks but the first and second gen airpods sound worlds better than these do also the noise cancellation just isn’t a thing i guess?
"
Arthur Morgan ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was excited to use the 3rd gen AirPods after owning the 2nd gen AirPods for 2+ years. These were initially impressive, with spatial audio especially. However, the more I used and listened to music, the more I could notice their flaws. High frequency notes have a clipping/choppy sound at low/decent volume. Spatial stereo makes tracks sound tiny. However, battery life is great. Water resistance is an added bonus. If you're in the Apple ecosystem, these will switch flawlessly with modern Apple devices. In the end, for me, it comes down to audio. How music sounds is very important to me. These were just not the upgraded AirPods I had hoped for. Will be switching to the Sony WF-1000XM4 noise cancelling earbuds as my 2nd gen AirPods replacement.

"
Keith,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  At $477, these are still very expensive but enough for me to give it a try. Have been using these for two weeks and so far I like them a lot. I'm not an audiophile. To my average ears, sounds are crystal clear, immersive with great instruments separation. Bass can be heavy at time but very tight and no distortion. NC works quite well. Transparency mode is the best out of all the ones I've used before. They sound so natural just like you didn't have the headset on your head.,Downsides, these are heavy and the clamp force was a bit much for me at the beginning. I reduced the clamping force by bending it backward a few times and now they are quite comfortable.,Build quality is on another level compare to Bose and Sony.
"
M M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really enjoy these headphones and the quality sound they produce! The only thing I wish was a bit different, would be the ability to physically turn the headphones on or off. Currently, you have to put the headphones back in the case to retain charge. Also, for the price, it would be nice if they included a charging block, but this isn’t the biggest deal breaker. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely purchase again.,One last thing, I would definitely recommend the apple care because if something goes wrong you will get a replacement pair for free. Worth it for such a hefty price tag.
"

  These are simply the best Bluetooth headphones you can buy. I love these headphones. The sound quality is magnificent. I use these daily at the gym without any issues. I listen to lots of music so I believe I know of what I speak. Expensive but worth it. You get what you pay for.
"
Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These headphone are beautiful, fit great, are very comfortable and do not hurt the top of my head or my ears. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is the best I have ever experienced. Easy to connect to all my apple devices and the battery life is an unreal 20 hours! I highly recommend these headphones.
"
Shannon Woodall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've always known this could be an issue - but it's been 20 years since I used over-the-ear headphones and I figured that technology had gotten to the point where I shouldn't be concerned - and it's Apple, c'mon - they design everything to be as user friendly as possible.,I was wrong - I am so disappointed that my ears get too warm to use this comfortably.,Also - if you wear readers and you take them on/off - having over-the-ear headphones is a chore.  Stick with ear buds.
"
Adam Parsons ART,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  There's only one thing wrong with these headphones that I've found...they press tight to your head and until you get used to them it can feel quite compressing.,That being said I'm sure that tight fit is WHY the noise cancellation and sound quality are so good. Seriously... these are outstanding headphones and although I didn't want to pay $550 for them... I was more than ok to pay nearer $400 now that the price came down for the holidays.
"
Jason S,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound was truly amazing but after wearing for a few days it became apparent it was not for me. I am working from home and so need a versatile headphone set. The music and sound quality plus noise reduction was beyond my other IPods. The issue was talking on calls, no one could hear me. I tried support and al was ok.,This and the fact after a while my ears hurt from having them on for hours.,Loved the sound but too much for just that.
"
Brendan Scott,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Comfortable and convenient but after 16 days audio starts dropping randomly from right ear followed by overwhelming static and complete disconnect then restart. 28th day, they connect to devices but have no audio or anc.,Apples response because I didn't buy Apple care.  ""Please ship them in for evaluation and repairs"".,Thank goodness Amazon still cares about customer experience and gave me a full refund after the 30 days.
"
Bryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  the build quality is insane.  These are hefty in a good way, they feel solid and well made.  The sound is great.  Noise cancellation works really well too.  Yeah, they are expensive as hell.  But the integration with my phone, iPad and computer is so seemless that it makes me not regret getting comparable (soundwise) but less expensive models.
"
Matt Eye,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this new iPad Pro, but it takes forever and an eternity for Apple to get these new pieces of beautiful tech in stock anywhere. Some complain about the blooming problem, but I don't do HDR and cannot afford a $10,000 Hasselblad to do that kind of content, so the brightness problem just does not affect me. This is a very nice 2 TB option, which Amazon only sells up to half a TB, unfortunately. I did buy a case and screen protector from here on Amazon, but have not reviewed them yet. Camera on the new iPad Pro is the one from the 2017 iPhone X, which is actually decent. Not in good light, still kind of blotchy. The native Camera App does not work with the 'tracking' that is new to the front-facing camera, but that is because you need certain third-party Apps that can utilize it. Not much else to say, I love iPads. Oh, the speakers on this thing almost as good and loud as my 27"" iMac! Five stars, very little to complain about as far as the product goes. Being hard to find is a Samsung issue and is irrelevant to rating this item. Thank you.
"
L. Holloway,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my 5th ipad since the original, but this is my first iPad Pro. I finally bit the bullet and I am very happy with my purchase, sure it is expensive, but keep in mind this  is the type of device you have to use for awhile to see why they charge what they do. If you already have a recent iPad pro, it may not be worth the cost of an upgrade, but if you are on the fence on whether to spend iPad pro money, I would say to give it a shot if you like to watch media and do anything that you may do on your phone, just much bigger and better scale. What convinced me to make this purchase and go for top of the line was I wanted a tablet to use to properly stream xbox and playstation games remotely and it does not disappoint doing that a bit. I am very happy with my new iPad, so far it is one of my best Apple product experiences.
"
G. Ware Cornell Jr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Why would you sell a year old iPad Pro 11? The answer is you wouldn’t unless you had an opportunity to own the incredible 12.9 inch iPad Pro with Apple’s M1 chip. I’m used to fast iPads but this tablet uses the same chip that powers its fastest desk and laptops.,I have used my iPads over many years in my law practice for everything “except heavy lifting.” By that I mean major written work like briefs and extensively memoranda.  For these i use my 13 inch MacBook Pro.,However, I can’t say that anymore. Here’s why. I’ve added a keyboard to my new iPad Pro and I ended up with a hybrid laptop which is only slightly smaller than the MBP, It is however more powerful and faster than either the MPB or the iPad Pro 11.  Both are on the market.
"
Anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Hardware,No hiccups yet. The m1 chip might be a beast.,Screen,Probably the best part of the tablet. It’s a 1440p 120hz display. Very fluid and clear. Bright and colorful. I only wish it was 4K.,Battery,On max brightness the battery drains quite fast. Charges fast at least.,Design,The best looking apple device in my opinion.,Sound,Stereo speakers are nice.,Value,A great device, but you’re gonna pay the apple tax. You’re most likely gonna buy a keyboard and pencil as well. Consider the iPad Air or MacBook Air.
"
Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nice, well made tablet. Large display looks good. Overpriced. Was excited about the high end display and the M1 chip, but I don't really notice anything of this with daily use. Maybe there are apps that I haven't found that would make the display and M1 chip stand out. So far, it's JUST a tablet for me. Procreate is great, but it's a $10 app that's similar to so many other apps. Pay over $1000 for the tablet and then asked to subscribe to news, arcade games, online storage...  Don't regret my purchase. Wish it didn't cost so much. Guess I expected more after all the promos.
"
RNR,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased this to replace my 1st gen 12.9 iPad Pro. I also purchased the Apple Keyboard.  Yes that is a $1500 purchase, but the two together are wonderful.  After learning a few trackpad gestures I hardly ever need to use the touch screen - although it its there if you need it.  The display, battery life and speed are over-the-top great.  I have not noticed the “blooming” that is critiqued here.
"
Dre ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Okay I’ve had this iPad for a little over 3 weeks now  and yes you can notice bloom around things.,But let’s be honest this thing is amazing. I personally can care less about the blooming. Although I think it probably shouldn’t be there for the price we pay for these things but like I said I can honestly care less about it. I don’t think people should be giving this 1 star because of it but just my opinion. I’m coming from a regular iPad so this is a huge upgrade for me
"
Paw423,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Ipad appears to be functional and adequate but with a less than optimal battery life.  My wife purchased an ipad pro for me in August for a birthday.  At the time, Apple was offering free air pods with the purchase of an ipad pro.  However, when I contacted Apple technical support a few minutes ago, they reported that you only got the air pods if you ordered directly through Apple.
"
Nic Studio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love it, absolutely love it! The only thing is, the M1 chip is too powerful for a tablet. If you have the 3rd gen or 4th gen of the 12.9"" iPad Pro, I don't really see a point of upgrading it yet until Tim Cook put the MacOS on the iPad Pro to make it complete. I did a 2018 vs 2021 iPad Pro comparison video on my YouTube channel under my name Nic Studio if you guys are interested.
"
david,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I do not find this M1 processor to be any faster than on my 2020 version, nor is this “super beautiful screen” any different. I do photo manipulation and expected a faster, more brilliant iPad. WRONG. keep what you have. It is not worth the big bucks!

  With the new M1 chip, this computer really outperforms the previous model. I’ve used this for school and it’s been excellent. It’s fast, quite, and powerful for daily tasks and work.

  These were the Airpods that I was not considering. I was all set to get the pros or the 2nd generation airpods, but when these went down to $139 I had to get them.

These are my first set of airpods, I highly recommend them only if you can get them at the right price.

KrazyKs,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have owned the original Air Pods , and the Pro. Version. I decided to get this new version after my Pros got stolen out of my truck. It might just be my ears but these will not stay in at all , not a snug fit.  I will be going back to the Pro version as they have the ear tip to help keep them in the ear.

  Pros:,- perfect fit: running, chewing, teeth brushing, unclothing - the pods stay in ears,- seamless experience: connection speed, switching to ipod and back, hands free answering,,- excellent microphone quality,- great battery life,- open design - I hear everything around me, no need to take them off to hear around,Cons:,- bass quality is lower compared to silicone tips headphones, but was expected and accepted
"
Nathan B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got a pair for Christmas I like them, but I don’t know that they’re much better than Gen 2. I don’t really notice the noise canceling, and they’re a little bit more bulky and hard to get in and out of the case in the old version. I think the old version was just a little bit sleeker. Still good.
"
R,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Definitely much bigger than gen1/2 style. So big the left one sometimes pops out, but still way better fit than pros for me (can’t do the ear tips, they give me headaches). Do take some getting used too for longer wear. But man, that sound. For a wireless earbud, it’s pretty sweet. Good battery too.
"
Mercedes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like them. I upgraded from 2nd gen. They are authentic. I wish they would make the ear part smaller. I’m small and have small ears. Didn’t like the design of Pros so didn’t buy those. They connected super quick. Overall, I’m happy and Amazon got them to me the same day so that was great too
"
Mommaof2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had read mixed reviews  before trying these but glad I did.  These are not meant for noise cancelling so if that is what you are wanting please try something else.  They are smaller than the series 2, which took a bit to adjust to and get the right position in my ears.  Glad I did not give up as I love them now.  I have to position them differntly than the series 2 to get a good fit.  I really like them
"
Jose B,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm giving this review a 3 star due to a few things. The wrapping on the box was not factory at all looked like someone re-shrink wrapped them and returned them. When I open the box it had no factory seal on it like most apple products, looked inside, and had no charger and the AirPods didn't have the plastic that comes with them when they are new. AirPods had no battery but was able to charge in on my wireless charger. I was able to connect to them but had issues with them staying on they are too big, my pros fit better, and would definitely recommend the pros over these. will definitely be returning these back.
"
Kimberly Hetrick,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Perhaps my ears are small, but I find this version (3) and the version AirPods PRO 3 to be too large for my ears and quite uncomfortable.  Therefore, I do not get any of the tech benefits of either pair of AirPods 3.  I gave both my three pairs to my sons and purchased the AirPods 2 version.  I hope that Apple considers different ear sizes for future designs.
"

  I really want to like these headphones more but the fact that they will struggle to play audio on my computer about once a day or so is infuriating. These are expensive headphones with no excuse for bad playback at a mac I am sitting in front of.,When they don't struggle to play audio they work really well, and mostly can jump between iphone, ipad and mac without issue
"
Timothy R Barnes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I spent almost 1700 I got the new Ipad Pro 12.9 as well so yeah I spent some money but just go to work and forget about it.  The headphones sound really great.  Don't be a cheap skate.  :)  The new Ipad Pro is just something that is just cool a must have!
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  All in all I love these headphones but for the asking price it’s definitely not worth it imo. These are basically the AirPods Pro but on Steroids. It does everything the Pros does but much better in a Over the head headphones form. But that’s also a flaw that there isn’t any new feature that’s exclusive to the AP Max. Plus the price is ridiculous and honestly wouldn’t recommend wearing these in public (unless You the type to travel in planes a lot) as they are not water resistant and depending on the environment you are in someone can try to rob you for them.,I wish Apple can put the price to around $250 to $300 and I would 100% recommend these to everyone. Other than that, these are amazing headphones but also hard to recommend them just for the price Alone being too damn high
"
Kenneth Hillin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely amazing Apple build quality. The audio quality is the best that I’ve heard from any Bluetooth headphones. Also it is the most comfortable headphones I’ve ever worn. Truly amazing, the noise cancellation and transparency is the amazing. Battery life is outstanding as well I use them all day and charge them at night and never have a problem. Only downside is the carrying case they come with is absolutely not protective and I would recommend getting a separate case if you want to travel with these in a bag often. Other than that they are absolutely amazing!

"
Mike Roberson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It is hard to find fault with the AirPods Max, although the price point has room for improvement. I have been through my share of both wired and wireless over-ear headphones and these are the best wireless I have owned and keep pace with some wired sets. The noise cancellation is great, the sound quality is very good. So far the claim of 20 hours of music/talk time is true, which is impressive.,The cover for them is dumb. I'll rarely ever travel with them, so not a big deal for me.
"
Michael Angelo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The AirPods max from Apple are fantastic! Noise cancellation and noise transparency work just fine! I like the crown they added on the headphones to adjust the volume! These headphones have helped me study in peace and I also enjoy its spatial audio! It sounds like you and the TV are the only ones in the house!
"
Joshua H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very good headphones, Apple did an amazing job. However the seller sent me a damaged, and scratched product, opened and missing the case which can’t be replaced. Also someone he signed into the device and I had to remove their account.,They gave me a refund and return but be careful who you buy from.
"
FRNAK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve used beats pro,Bose , Sony wh-m4 , AirPods, power beats pro…. But this is what I been looking for a long long time … Wow, so comfortable for a big head, and covers all ears!  Noise canceling, and guess what ? It don’t feel hot at all even after 7 hours on wearing, usually with Sony it gets too hot and sweaty but with this one, man! Just buy it you won’t regret, don’t waste money on anything else, this will be your final destination!

dcime,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  3 Weeks In…It’s official, the New 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 Is currently the Best Tablet In The World. But please do not get this confused! This is much more than a Tablet. This is a full blown laptop replacement. It took a while, but they did it. The M1 Apple (in house) Processor, the 1000 nits of brightness with a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio screen. This is the NEW, the amazing, 2021 iPad Pro LED screen with that huge size! A newly made learning experience all for the best… My previous iPad (Sold for $200) was a 6th Gen standard iPad that was used primarily for surfing the web and streaming high res music from Tidal. I am a true music lover. I collect high end DAC’s, Amps and Headphones, mostly wired. When I first pre-ordered the New iPad, for some reason I went with the 11 in. Why? Probably because it was $300 less expensive for one reason! Secondly, I convinced myself that a 12.9 screen size was just too big! Too big for everyday tasks and just too huge to lug around. I admit it now, I was dead wrong. The 11 in. had to go back. It was a sad day. I thought I had thought this one out. I was wrong. After 1 week with that 2021 iPad Pro 11 I felt almost cheated. I knew I was spending a lot of cash, but was it spent on the wrong device? I had hunger pains for the 12.9. It was meant to be! Then I did it, after tons of YouTube videos and 100’s of articles… I packaged up that pre-orderd 11 in and proceeded to right then and there order the Brand New 2021 12.9 in, right here on Amazon. It was a painless transaction. When it arrived, I knew I was all in. Yes sir, this was, is the Tablet of all Tablets to beat. Now hear this, I love Samsung as a company and have a Galaxy S20+ 5G phone made by  them. Only 1 year old. I just love that SAMOLED display. I love the speed. I did not just love, well, anything else. Google dropped a very large, heavy ball when they neglected to focus on Tablet Apps. Mostly, at about 85% the Android apps are written with no regard or monitoring, for a 7 inch screen. The New iPad Pro has a 12.9 in screen, so no, that just wont work. Samsung battles on, producing some of the very first finest tablets and smartphones to come to market. Most of the other vendors have given up. Asus and LG were the last two standing next to Samsung. They just could not compete. That ended within the last few years but like I mentioned earlier, Samsung pushed on! I am the proud owner of a very nice Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 11in. in ALL of its beauty and speed. Photos look great, movies have deep blacks and general content is certainly better than just fine. The problem is, its a phone. It’s a 7in. by 2.5in. phone, and its still using phone apps. You should understand that when your the last in line holding that Tablet, you NEED to rely on what’s right in front of you. That great display just cannot provide the much needed app content to match the iPad. Myself, I am a convert. I was dead set against Apple for many years. Then came my 2019 MacBook Pro 15. I want to stress this point please… I was and still am so enamored by the amazing (non-touch) beautiful LED display, the raw power of Intels Quad Core  i7, the 512gb SSD and of course the 16GB of 4th gen. onboard RAM. To this day, I STILL very much love that Apple laptop. It rarely fails me, its always updated and “oh my” that screen is just gorgeous! No Windows based laptop could compete. Not my Microsoft Surface Pro 7, not my Dell Inspiron 4K UHD monster touch screen laptop. None of them could compete. I was transformed into a Mac lover. For sure I did not set out to be one, but I can proudly say today, I am. As technology advances at a blistering fast pace, one needs to keep up or, be left in the dust. That is exactly when and where the iPad Pro comes in. An amazingly fast laptop M1 processor, 256GB SSD, 8GB Dual Channel 5th Gen RAM. A touch screen that begs to be touched. Accessories albeit overpriced designed for a specific Tablet. There is no shortage OR doubt that Apple is making more money than ever hand over fist. The benefit to that is that so much of that money goes in to R & D (Research & Development). Picture this, if you will, a boardroom with 22 fine Corinthian leather chairs seated around a huge Mahogany board room table. Fast forward and Apple CEO’s and CFO’s tell the lucky 20 others at the end of that meeting this. “We think we have a true winner here. We want you to take these home and live with them, for 2 weeks minimum to a month maximum.” The meeting closes and the lucky 20 walk out with what will eventually become the 12.9 2021 iPad Pro. After a month, they are all brought back in to that meeting room. They discuss all the (mainly Pros) and Cons. Small improvements here, a few deletions there and then we have it. That laptop replacement I spoke about in the start of this review. Yes, you can have your cake AND eat it too. The attention to build quality detail is practically flawless. The utter speed of that Apple designed and implemented M1 Processor. The mind blowing mini LED screen that rivals that from LG OLED HDTVs.  This tablet will take your breath away. You will be transformed in to a lover of everything iPad. There is far too much to much too list in one Amazon review. It would not be fair for me to try to cram EVERYTHING into one hand written, typed review. These are Amazon Reviews and should not be the length of a book or you will pass the review by for a few shorter ones. To all of you that made it this far in my review, I applaud you. Thank you for hanging in there! That is exactly Apples philosophy. Make darn sure every 20 members in that room are unanimous. A very resounding YES, we hit the ball right on the screws and it has left the ballpark. More balls come and they too get smashed out of the park. Is it unfair for Apple to have this much leverage and without a doubt over-charge the consumer in return for pure, unbridled greatness? Probably. Let me finish with this please…Most of us work very hard for a paycheck, salary, fee or whatever. It is all Green in the end. Picture this… Two tablets are sitting in front of you and you are practically drooling over those displays. Your feel like you’ve seen this movie before. The software opens up. You look down, then back up as you contemplate all those pros and cons surrounding a 12.9 in iPad Pro and a 12 in Samsung Galaxy S7 Pro. Same price! The decision may not be so easy, but I will add one more piece to this puzzle that was missing. The operating System and the 1 Million or so apps made SPECIFICALLY for an Apple Tablet screen.  IPad is on the right, Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 on the left. Same price. Which one are you going to be confident of that your hard earned green is placed in the proper pocket? They both boot up and the screens are stunning and just blow you away. Then the dust settles and you are all alone (*in your head). Be honest here, when and if you have that choice between 2 of the best Tablets. Not Laptop PCs doing double duty as a tablet and PC. No. This is a contest between 2 of the very best Tablets in the world! Which one would you pull the trigger on. The Android Version convoluted with unknown device software that varies SO MUCH from device to device, A somewhat confusing Windows 10 Pro that may or may be not “up to date” with proper antivirus software, a necessity! Or do you look at the iPad in the middle with the Magic Keyboard or Logitech keyboard case. You look left, you look right, then you look back again to front and center at that very New 2021 very large 12.9 in screen that cries out to just be touched. Which device will you choose>? Are you going to remain an uninspired Apple hater, or are you all wrapped up in Windows? At this point, Android has left the building. Windows 10 Pro hangs in there against iPad OS 14.5. Two tablets left. I look to the left, then to the right. I am sweating now and my heart is racing. Which one is begging me to “future proof” and buy into the whole operating system experience? Yes, this actually happened to me. A very long time Microsoft PC and laoptop owner. A lover of Samsung Galaxy Pro PHONES. And then I cave. To realize all that money could bestow my love but too needing to choose one device in the now, and  one in the end. That device is the 2021 iPad Pro 12.9. Exploring all it can do every day learning something new I feel invigorated. My inspiration for a Tablet (and a keyboard) cries out to be touched and learned. I am excited, frustrated, a long deep breath as I work through this NEW “learning experience” second to none. Yes, the 2021 iPad Pro LED 12.9 inch display takes my breath away. Be it pure geek/beast mode now. Then, at that very moment when I hand over my credit card I know…I know in my gut I made the right decision. That decision, again, is that 12.9 2021 iPad Pro. I have arrived and there is no looking back. One and done. My confidence returns and I am practically begging to learn more. This is my true story. I hope I helped someone, anyone! To understand just how difficult that One Grand gets spent. Apple gets richer and its back to the boardroom because there is talk of a new M1X chip. The tablet has not even arrived at your front door and Apple is already back in that boardroom discussing the near and far future of Apple Devices. The line blurs. Is it a Tablet or a Laptop? I will leave it up to YOU to make that decision! Remember this please, enjoy your purchase and learn all about it. Get the very most out of that big purchase. Your future you will thank you.
"
Orly,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great tablet as very fast with the M1 Chip but too large and heavy.  Might as well have the 13"" MacBook Pro which was released at the end of 2020.  Returned and purchased the 11 inch iPad Pro from Best Buy.
"
J. David Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Before buying my first iPad, i bought Android phones and tablets. The tablets would rarely last 18 months. I have one ipad that is four years old and still works great. This one my wife uses. The few times i called tech support, the reps were awesome. In fact, i have never had better support. Both of us use the iPad multiple hours per day. It is great for reading, shopping, listening to music and books, and web browsing. The sound is great and when i am away from the house, the cellular comes in handy. The are tons of apps. Highly recommend.
"
@DanMiami,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I replaced my old iPad Pro with this one. The display is gorgeous and I love having an extra screen to use with my MacBook when I am traveling. It is *almost* like having my MacBook pro with me. I really wish they would allow MacOS to run on this thing because with the addition of the magic keyboard it is just a step away from being an awesome travel computer.

denny_sf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What Apple couldn't stock in their stores, Amazon got to me in 2 days, delivered quickly, safely and at a great price. The iPad with 256Gb was sealed in the original outer APPLE shipping box, and was a thrill setting up. I had a new 11"" iPad Pro but opted for the new LED screen and bigger size, sending it back to Apple for a refund.  I will never look back, this is STUNNING and a joy. I dont find it heavy, simply one of my best Amazon purchases.

  Major rip off.. Apple has only 8.9% of the computer market and I see why. This is a giant money pit , doesn't even have standard usb ports and you need dongles for dongles for dongles which is a lot more money.  For this money the performance is laughable,  my $1,900 laptop does circles around this thing. If you want to purchase this to occasionally game on,  go somewhere else as the m1 has poor game compatibility and is a barren wasteland. This is a giant money grab. You'll have a better experience on a windows machine where things are actually supported.
"
D. Glotfelty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My 16'"" Macbook M1 pro, 16gb ram, 512ssd 10 cpu/16 gpu,  Space Grey was purchased from a big box retailer. I wanted to review here because I feel the one star reviews are not well thought out.,DOA's happen - I actually prefer that up front while Applecare and the retailer returns are all in full force. The more interesting detail I'd like to hear is how well did Apple/Retailer handle replacement?,As for the USB/Thunderbolt oval ports upgrade, inexpensive dongles are here and can be shipped Prime just like the computer itself. That is fully detailed in the specs and connectivity pictures - heck the MacAir prior to M1 was already using this oval port. The new ports (3) are high speed / power and versatile for displays and storage. Also we are not losing one to power - we are back to magsafe, which I really like. Ports are also there for HDMI and SD cards - again very useful. One negative is the two USB3 ovals on the left side are close - too close for two adaptors. And a sound port. Overall a real win port wise,Sound. The same way they are improving thin TVs inboard sound this laptop has killer sound compared to past models. Really full with nice bass and well defined.,Retina display. 16.2 inch and awesome sharp, fantastic color, contrast, and wide angle.,Weight - 16 inch has one draw back, almost 5 pounds.  Not a problem for me but it's no Air.,Battery - as advertised plays movies, browses, games all day long and is barely warm on the lap - very nice.,Security/Keyboard - Fingerprint reader has been very reliable and keyboard lighting and feel is great. Trackpad is accurate and very large.,Compatibility - So far decent but I'm just beginning to explore.  VLC does a lovely job playing video/audio, Steam is supposedly poor but I've had some initial luck with my favorites - Wingspan, Tabletop Simulator, Pinball Arcade (warned it not might run in 32bit mode and then proceeded to run flawlessly after a few dozen keychain authorizations), Scythe all run under Steam. So far LibreOffice hasn't worked - I may need a reinstall or it may be problematic. For now My Chrome is working alongside Safari so browser choices are solid.  Notes, Numbers and Apple's apps are solid so I can wait on LibreOffice.,Value - What can you say here Apple gear is always salty, but I tend to find the quality hard to resist.,A new ARM processer that is this solid out of the gate with unreal efficiency and cool operation is promising. I'm sure there will be more old software with issues but I am encouraged by how much old and third party software runs.  So - don't let a few problems out there hold you back - this is the future of Apple.,Five Stars.
"
Kou,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought this from the Apple store, since Amazon was taking forever on the 1TB model.,Pros: It does exactly what Apple advertises: quiet.  The laptop is power efficient, does not heat up much (if any at all), has good battery life, powerful CPU, and GPU for work loads such as video editing, and the speakers are good (for a laptop that is). The CPU is not the best when compared to the Ryzen 9 5900HS, or 11th Gen i9; however, the fact that the M1 Pro CPU can deliver great performance (which rivals the competition) and be highly power efficient, is a Big Plus.  Unlike other laptops, whether I plugin the laptop, or not, I’m certain to get the max performance.,Cons: Price is a bit steep for many, but then again, there are Dell Precision laptops which are at the same price point.  Some parts (edges, and heat vents) of the laptop feels a bit sharp, and there’s zero upgradability.,Overall, for what I’m planning to use it for, it’s a great laptop.  But for the average user, unless you have money to burn, $2700 is quite a bit to spend on a laptop.

  I was originally getting the blue one, but it was sold out. The green one would take too long. So, I got the silver. I mess around with and it runs smoothly and faster. My old laptop was fast and couldn't do anything that I needed to do with it. This iMac did the job.

  Loved the sound quality but they would fall out if I even moved my head slightly. After contacting technical support to see if there was something I was doing wrong they suggested I return for a refund. I was really disappointed as the sound quality and ease of hookup was just wonderful.
"
FatBoyPaul,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Might just be me. But the 1st gen sounded better and first gen fit in my ears better. Just a little too big. Don't get me wrong cause the sound quality is really good, it's just different than the first gen for sure. And they are real with a valid serial number.
"
Chris ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these for my wife for Christmas and they only stay in her ears if she stays completely still and doesn't move. If she walks, talks, or smiles while wearing these earbuds, they fall right out. We even tried what Apple suggests for tweaking the fit, which is to insert the buds and then turn them so the stem is aligned with your jaw. It didn't help at all. These buds are just too big and there's nothing you can do if they don't work for you except to return them and revert back to the 2nd generation AirPods. Oh well! We went ahead and returned them.
"
Spewbaca,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My wife is an iPhone user. She had the 1st Gen AirPods until they gave out recently and refused to connect consistently.,Best Christmas gift (her words), and a bunch of brownie points into my column. Yes I'll expend the points by mid January, but for right now? Woo Hoo!
"
Chris H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I know that some folks have had issues with these staying in their ears, but they fit my ears perfectly and don't seem to move at all when I'm walking or running.  The sound is certainly an upgrade over the first-gen AirPods, and the spatial audio is extremely impressive.  All in all, I'm very happy with this new version.
"
Lawrence Dugan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound seems like it’s coming from the center of my brain and not through my ears. I’ve got the AirPod pros and the 3rd generation are better than the pro.,As far as fit I can’t give a legitimate evaluation on that aspect since I haven’t been doing a lot of walking and running lately.,Buy these AirPods as soon as you can I guarantee you that you’ll agree.
"
Sam,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've had every version of airpods so far, these are a step up in every way except the fit. Version 2 is absolutely perfect fit for me and never fell out or became dislodged. Version 3 does. Wish they would have kept the same shape as v2, other than that it is a nice upgrade.
"
Tony Roberts,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Let me start by saying that I love Apple products universally. But, as for these AirPods they don’t sit in my ears nearly as well as the previous version and aren’t as seated and tend to fall out with less movement than the other longer AirPods. I honestly bought them thinking that for the price the sound quality would be much improved. That isn’t the case at all. No where near enough bass and no real increase in total volume. If it weren’t for the minimal noise canceling features I probably would have returned them entirely.
"
inoeth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Price is a little high (apple tax), sound is decent, battery is decent, water proof is good, fits surprisingly well for a non-tipped bud that actually stays in your ears well. There are better buds out there (for a lot more $) but the AirPods do work great for iPhone users
"
M_Squared,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great for sensitive ear canals. Bought to replace my wired-in ones. Was skeptical about blue tooth earbuds, but new phones don't have earphone jacks.

  Podria reemplazar perfectamente a una MacBook, excepto por la incapacidad del sistema operativo que no permite correr los programas normales del Big Sur. Con su único puerto USB C puede manejar perfectamente un SSD de 2 TB con la misma velocidad de su memoria interna, e incluso sobre mi MacBook Air M1 tiene la ventaja de la pantalla sensible.  No he probado ninguna tableta que se aproxime a las posibilidades que tiene el iPad Pro 12,9

  This is a huge improvement in my school life.,Magnet battery charge function saves your time and reduces distraction.,Spacious screen-which is even larger than my macbook air-gives me enough space to annotate my ebooks. I moved from Ipad7 to this with little bit of hesitation. But, unlike 7 with which I had to zoom in and out to annotate my books, i can do it just the way it is. Great improvement!

Austin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The iPad pro is very high quality. I bought the large version so I could have as much writing/drawing space as possible, but found it to be too big. I bought an iPad mini and preferred it. Even though it was smaller, it was easier to hold for long periods of time. That and I didn't notice a difference in performance. If you're debating between the pro or the mini, I'd recommend the mini.

W. Calvin Morris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Good sound, accurate detail, good spatial resolution.  Revealed a flaw in my aging iPhone's Bluetooth which has me looking at an upgrade, but it was time anyway.  Slightly heavy, but over the ear with solid build gives a sense of sound isolation that there is just no other way to achieve.  Good for serious listening and High Resolution audio.

"
Joshual,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these to try overhead earphones. Turns out to be junk. Way over priced first off. Great build quality but not the smartest design due to the fact that condensation starts forming inside of the earphones. Not sure if this is what caused the issues but within a month they stopped connecting to devices. Returned them though Apple but then the new ones that came started to have connection issues as well within a week or 2.  Would not recommend these at all

"
Michael K,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are amazing headphones. But I realized I’m not enough of an audiophile to find the value in the AirPod Max. Honestly, the only good use case I could find was taking them on airplanes with me - but they’re too bulky for me to justify lugging them around. I ended up returning them.
"
Lex,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Only reason I pulled the trigger was because it was $100 off. I still don’t know if I would’ve purchased full price. Now that I have them, I love them.,Battery life is great too. I get a nice 2 days of use at work and home easily, switching between conference calls and music.

  These headphones don’t even compare to the Sony xm4’s. The Max is crazy comfortable, and it works amazing when connected to a tv for movies! Can’t tell a difference in the sound quality or noise cancelation, but both are pretty good. Way too overpriced, but it’s the best you’re gonna get and was worth every penny.

Butchmeister,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm not a video content user, or do any heavy video editing that may tax the processor or GPU. I'm more a casual user, so the full power and potential features of this laptop will never be used by me. So why would I spend a whopping $2,500 on a 16-inch laptop? Two reasons, my old 2012 MacBook Pro has reached obsolesce and after December 2021 Apple will no longer support it (no more security updates). Secondly, I am heavily into the Apple ecosystem. iPad, iPhone, iMac and I really like how all my devices work together seamlessly. Also, I'm an older guy (euphemism for senior citizen) and I really like and prefer a larger screen size on my laptop as opposed to portability. Having got all that out of the way, let me share this, this laptop is AMAZING. The screen display is incredibly sharp with vivid colors. It has a comfortable keyboard with good backlighting. The very large glass track pad is very responsive, and Apple's software is excellent at palm rejection, so your resting hands do not interfere when your typing. The sound output through the speakers is very, very impressive, almost unbelievable for laptop. The laptop's aluminum frame is solid. It is a big, bulky laptop, so if you're on the go and looking for a laptop to lug around everyday, I recommend you look at the 13-inch Mac laptops. Buying a laptop at this price range is a huge investment and I recommend that potential buyers do their due diligence and compare features and costs of both Macs and Windows PCs, especially if you're not in the Apple ecosystem. But, If, however you want a larger 16-inch screen and a Mac laptop then your choices will be the 2020 (Intel) or 2021 MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) and of the two, I recommend the M1 Pro version. Once I got over the sticker shock, I really am very happy with my 2021 MacBook. My recommendation? Two thumbs up!
"
doctornewyork,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Last Macbook Pro I had was from 2015, so this 2021 one is definitely an upgrade. I got 64GB RAM and 2TB storage, so the price was an upgrade. Overall: faster, smoother, and SILENT. There's no fan concern anymore as compared to the old models. That alone is the best aspect.,Dumb drawbacks:,- The Paintbrush program, arguably the most simple and unsophisticated program on the Macbook, has a bug/flaw where I cannot add text to a new project without the program closing. This never happened once on the old computer. Repeatedly, if you try to add text, the program just closes. Considering I paid a fortune for this computer, this was utterly mindblowing. I couldn't remove + re-add the program either, since it's a fixed Mac program in the hardware. So I downloaded some other random paint-type program from the app store. Just dumb.,- The lack of USB-A ports is incredibly stupid and an inconvenience. It's so obvious that Mac just wants to make money off of selling their adapters. One might argue this isn't a big deal, but I never had to deal with adapters on the Macbook Pro 2015. So the fact that I've paid a fortune for this new computer and I don't have a functional Paintbrush program + need to use adapters now is just inconvenient and dumb, considering how much time and technology goes into these computers. It's like, why inconvenience people?,- I needed to purchase new subscriptions to various programs in order to use them on my new computer. For example, I had a Microsoft Word license on the 2015 Macbook. But it wouldn't carry over to the 2021 computer. If you had purchased a one-off license for use on one device instead of an online yearly subscription, you'll find you have to re-purchase Microsoft 365. A couple other programs also didn't work and I had to re-purchase and download.,I give the computer 4 stars because of these inconveniences in comparison to the price. If the price is a lot lower, there's less to complain about. But I paid a lot of money and expect a flawless device, not a bugged paint program and the annoyance of needing to use adapters now.

Christo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Been using my new Macbook Pro for only a week now but it hasn't skipped a beat and I wanted to get in this early review.  I edit videos in DaVinci Resolve and am a full time music engineer and work in Logic Pro.  For these tasks this computer is an absolute beast.  I own a Mac Pro tower decked out with every option I could throw at it a few years ago for much more money than this new laptop costs and it can't even hold a candle to it.  I am very impressed with the ease it completes all my tasks.,Besides performance I am thrilled that things like Magsafe and a host of ports were reintroduced to the body.  I actually am really enjoying the screen and the physical shape, weight and the speakers are nice and full.  The quick charge has already saved me a couple times and the battery lasts so long, even on my CPU/GPU heavy tasks.  If you work with heavy programs like I do and time is money, then this thing is a no brainer.
"
Miltz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m a computer technician for over 25 years now and I can build myself the best PCs. Yet I own the latest MacBook Pro 16 inch and I love it. These machines are amazing in every way. Keep in mind no product is perfect but these come close. I can’t stand to use windows 10 or 11 anymore. Once you go Mac, it’s very hard to go back to PC. The only use case I can think of where someone would want a PC laptop is gaming. Everything else Mac wins. There isn’t a windows laptop that even comes close to these machines. The funniest thing for me is how Windows laptops need to be plugged in for the best performance and they still lose to M1. It’s a laptop! Having to plug it in for it to perform well is ridiculous. Mac performs the same, plugged in or not.
"
Brian M.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is an amazing machine; however, my unit appears to have a flaw. It does not charge when shut down and the case is closed.  Many people on forums have the same problem. Fortunately, Apple has been very good about addressing this problem with me.
"
Jian Zheng,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Overall the machine is nice, even revolutionary.  However, the notch is there, I still cannot believe it's apple's design. How can apple make that?,Let's just admit having a notch on top of a laptop screen is a terrible idea, no matter what excuse you use.
"
slam sauce,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Will update as I use it but so far this thing is honestly a bigger bump from my 2013 15 inch MBP to my 2019 I9 MBP. ONLY USED A couple days will update later but so far the battery life is so good, the screen is godly, and the keyboard is so much better than the 2019 version. Basically anything you want in a laptop. I got the cheapest (cheapest lol) model, but basically that's saying a low end Ferrari since the cheapest is what most people would need (even more than most honestly). I do not game but use for work and need the larger monitor.,Just waiting on the case to come in not many options at this time but its just insane how much BETTER it is than an i9 version from 2019 (which itself was excellent minus battery life).,Biggest pluses,Screen is iPad quality, similar to my 2021 iPad Pro M1, speakers good, battery life great, and keyboard is MUCH better than that stupid dumb board they had in previous models.,Thusfar well worth the money esp with college faculty discount.
"
High Caliber,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Positives:,--All aluminum chassis,--Apple Silicon,--Apple Security,--Regular Keyboard,--Speakers/Sound,--Track-pad.,--Battery Life,--SD Card Slot,--Ventilation and No loud fans,--HDMI Port,Negatives:,--Top Notch. It invades screen space. Can't enjoy the screen real estate if it is being invaded.,--MagSafe Port may not charge batteries if laptop completely powered off or so the rumor goes.,--No Anodized Black Metal Chassis option (Macs have been a shady grey color for way too long. Either that or the default tuna tin can color).,--No USB-A ports. Lack of utility.,--No color matching of the cords and power brick to the laptop color. So vanilla.,Premium priced laptops are all about design design design. This year's design doesn't work for me. Maybe next year when Apple comes up with something more palatable, it can take my money.

Nicola,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am apple fans, compare to the second generation of headphones, the third generation of headphones timbre effects is very good ,battery life is also very awesome, but the only point I don’t like is the third generation of wear is bad . It’s easy to fall off your ears. I think the head is bigger than the second generation.,Compare the second generation, wearing not so comfortable. This is why I give a four-star.
"
anonymous ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought a pair, was really excited about the upgrade, but I'm going back to my old airpod 2's. At first I thought maybe I'm just not putting them in right, but over a 5hr period I literally tried every angle possible, and 1. they don't stay in my ears 2. takes about 3min before my ears start to hurt, and 3. maybe they just don't fit my ears enough but the sound quality is not much better unless I shove them in and hold it their while it hurts. I saw some good reviews and had high hopes, but I guess maybe you just have to have the kind of ear that fits these. Oh well, back to the old ones I go.
"
A,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The AirPod gen 3 is a Bass forward “V-shape” tuning, which is to be expected of apple products , noise canceling is only as good as the fit in your ears, they feel much larger in ear compared to older generations of AirPods. For the price I would say it’s better to save the money for AirPods Pro to gain a better sound, features, functionality, and comfortability. This new gen should be called the AirPod pro Lite edition
"
Drake,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These slip out of my ear very easily. I'm constantly adjusting them. They are bulky and oddly shaped. Not sure why they changed the shape in this generation. If the 1st or 2nd generation or Apple's corded earphones fit you, buy the 2nd generation! The sound quality difference isn't noticeable. Another negative is the controls are now on the stem, so if you go to adjust them, you will turn your music off, hang up on who you're talking to, or trigger Siri. It's really annoying. Buy the 2nd generation!
"
Rosalía Cortés,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Tengo la 2da generación de airpods y me quedan perfectos, no se me han caído nunca y llegan a ser muy cómodos. Esta generación a pesar de tener mejoras en sonido, el hecho de que se puede usar en lluvia y sudando. NO SE ADAPTA A TU OIDO. Al cabo de 5mn de tenerlos por el simple hecho de articular se va saliendo hasta que caen, lo que los hace imposibles de usar para hacer ejercicio o hablar, casi solo puedes usarlos sentado sin hacer ninguna expresión y escuchando música.,No los recomiendo a menos que te los hayas probado y compruebes que te quedan con anteriorida, ya que una vez abiertos, no puedes regresarlos.,Los vendi y me quede con los de 2da generación.
"
Douglas r.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am giving a 5 star because they are perfect for most people. They fall a little short for my needs but there is a solution. I work out a lot and get sweaty so I have had problems with these slipping out, even worse than other earbuds; however, I bought a case that wraps around them and keeps them in my ears so, problem solved, and it only cost me $7 for 3 of them. Definitely worth the little extra trouble because the sound quality blows away every other earbud I have tried and I have tried about 8, including beats ,which did not come close to sound quality.
"
HONG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered the Bose QC earbuds for 199, however, it doesnt work well. Or I should say its right bud died the second time I used them. I the order the Airpods 3. Well it fits my ear, pair with my other apple products wiht no issue. I guess, I should just stay at apple line products.
"
rikki,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The AirPods work great and they’re very easy to set up. Just open the included case while Bluetooth is on and then press CONNECT. Here’s the but.. the price is high for these, but that’s Apple for you. If you feel like splurging for the Apple brand, you’ll be happy once you get over the sticker shock.
"
Rick Arechar,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The product has good sound quality as well as supporting Dolby atoms. There is not much sound cancellation except for an EQ change that has not much impact. The battery life is fine, but be ready to charge it after a day or so of use or even no use. Other than that atleast for myself there has been a persistent issue with connecting the earbuds to my phone and computer. When connected to my iPhone it works wonders, but when I’m connected to my pc and switch to the iPhone the earbuds have issues connecting to the phone sometimes requiring manual resets. I hope this is a me thing it doesn’t matter too much because of how infrequently I use the earbuds for pc output.

  Wish it would have been more clear that this model can't do dual monitors. That's the only knock on it.

  The Mac is a great value. The battery lasts well past a work day and is quick.,The downsides are the lack of ports, and the incompatibility with some apps (crashing, etc).,Still 5 stars

  I bought my iPad pro from Apple store, but can't review it anywhere on the apple site. Still wanted help some new buyers. I had 2020 model 12.9 inch and now bought the 2021 model, honestly I don't see any significant improvement in day 2 day life, yes it's supposed to be much faster but I don't see it in my daily use from my previous model. The screen difference is ever so slightly better, not worth the extra money. The battery life is not good as the previous model, and charging it takes a horrendous amount of time. Please consider your options before buying it.

  I haven’t had an iPad for a few years and missed it but I have been waiting for a mini LED version of the 12.9 pro to be released. Watching HDR content is like watching it on my 4K Samsung tv but in a smaller portable form. I watched sorts of movies like John Wick 2 and 3, Jurassic Park and Alien that I own from iTunes to see her they looked. The picture is just fantastic, to be clear the resolution isn’t 4K on the iPad but more important  that is the the effect of the HDR made possible by the mini leds. The blacks are pitch black and bright parts of the screen are incredibly bright. I will be using the iPad for editing photos as well and I can see it’s going to a great experience. Everything works so fast and well with the updated M1 processor. I am glad I didn’t settle for the iPad Air that came out last year.

  Good luck. ""This item is not returnable"". You are stuck with this way overpriced piece of Apple garbage.,Great hardware artificially constrained by Apple by design. Do not be seduced by the hardware specs. Hardware is good. Software is terrible. This is not a laptop replacement. Even a very cheap laptop is more usable, and way less frustrating to use. I don't even bother to try to do anything on it anymore. EVERY task is a dead end. What a waste of money. Too expensive for it's limited usability.

  I've been using my new Airpods Max headphones for a few days now and I'm in love with them. I love the build quality, sound, noise cancellation, comfort, and battery life. I love everything about them but the price. These probably should have been marketed at $399. If you are in the market for a premium pair of headphones and have the money and are also deep into the Apple ecosystem (iPhone, Mac, iPad, etc.), I highly recommend getting these Airpods Max. Even with the steep price, I don't regret buying them.
"
Brent Perez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  People complain that the headphones don’t come with a charging block, and their new phones do the same thing. If you buy these, you should have an iPhone already with a compatible USB-C block.,The sound quality is amazing. Deep bass, clear audio, fits well on my head. If I turn and look another way, the NC kind of lessens up because of the fit on my head. Leather or fake leather earcups do better at NC, but they’re less comfortable.,The shut-off case idea was pretty stupid, but not bad enough. Just a reminder to keep them clean and enclosed, but I wish I had an on/off button.,Overall, would buy again. 9.5/10.

christopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Before buying the Aipod Max I used the Sony Xm3 and xm4. The Sony headphones are not built with the same quality but they are on par with the Apple Max. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem then these headphones are worth the price. But if you’re not then I would say buy thr Sony xm4. Both have great ANC and both feel comfortable on the head.

"
HamsterRat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These have excellent build quality and decent sound quality. I have heard equal quality for slightly lower price but it’s really the craftsmanship, noise cancellation, and seamless iOS integration where this thing shines. Buy if build and noise cancellation take higher priority than sound quality for you.
"

  Bought the new Series 7 watch after having a Fitbit Sense - Fitbit is complete garbage compared to the Apple Watch, not writing that as an Apple fan boy, just stating a fact coming from having the Fitbit Versa 2 and then the Sense, would never buy a Fitbit again, Apple Watch light years better by comparison, very happy with it!

  give these a miss.  They only fit your ear if you've been punched senseless by Mike Tyson.  They are great for exercise, however.  You will get countless reps of deep knee bends as you reach to pick these up off of the floor.,Cook needs to be fired for giving these the Green Light (and for screwing over App developers, but that's a different issue).
"
Lil D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the first time I’ve had a pair of AirPods and I love these. Very comfortable and fit well in my ears. DO NOT just fall out your ears. I don’t like inner ear plugs so these work great because I can still hear things around me, But I still get great sound quality.
"
Carlos Perez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like these airpods they have great sound quality compared to the other gens the bass on this is so good.The only thing I don't like about these is the noise cancellation isn't the best compared to the 2nd gen pros they are better on the noise cancellation portion.
"
Emily,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Get ready to catch them! They fall out so easy! That sound is ok, but they definitely don’t drown out too much outside noise. I thought they would be cool because they’re smaller, but I’ll stick with my normal AirPods that don’t fall out if I turn my head too fast 🙄
"
Annie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Compact; should have improved longevity when exposed to water & sweat than previous versions. The mic in my older version had stopped working after much use and abuse. I didn’t care for the Pro’s. So glad they came out with an updated version of the AirPods.
"
Meema21,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these a few weeks ago after 1 day of use the left earbud stopped working. It also would not fully charge. I got a replacement through amazon and the same thing happened again after a week of use! returning and trying my luck with the 2nd gen AirPods.
"
Bike Guy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's implied by omission but never stated that this product does not come complete with its charger.  Beware.  It must be ordered for an additional charge and is not included.  And, maybe just me but they easily fell out of my ears with the slightest movement.
"
Kris,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The fit is as good or better than the 2nd gen AirPods. I had upgraded to the Pros, but didn’t like the earpiece fit and the noise cancelation seemed to muffle the sound quality a bit. Returned them for these and I’m much happier. The battery life is excellent as well.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After reading some negative reviews and since I was upgrading from the already great series 1 Airpods, wasn’t sure if I was going to like these. They are great and a huge improvement. Love them! Ear fit and sound quality are excellent! Much improved! Will not be using any other previous versions. Spacial Audio is perfect!
"
Roman Prykhodko,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I need a MacBook for programming and the hobby of making music. Think between past 2020 and this one. Is the curtain so critical, and is there a big difference with the previous model, without loud hype?
"
Aidan Hunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This year's MacBook Pro with M1 Pro/Max merges the display technology and battery life that makes iPad Pro beautiful with the form factor and keyboard of a true professional laptop, plus the outstanding Apple Silicon architecture that blows Intel PCs out of the water.,Before I switched to the Mac in 2019, I was a devoted fan on the ThinkPad line of business-grade notebooks. I still love their outstanding durability and their substantial, boxy design that means business. I was thrilled to see some of that design language--plus more useful ports and a return to Apple's own MagSafe.,The hardest part for me was deciding between the 14"" and the 16"". I ultimately settled on the 16"" (middle priced model with 10core/16core, 16GB, 1TB model) and I'm happy with the choice. I did briefly look at the 14"" while I was picking up my order from the Apple Store, and I was really impressed with its portability. Once shipping times return to normal and there's no rush to order, I would suggest taking a look at them in-person. I think the 14"" this year offers far more value than the 13"", even the M1 13"" from last year. But I had already gotten used to the weight of a 16"" machine and I enjoy being able to multitask several windows without needing an external display. I really would have liked 32GB RAM, but $400 plus waiting weeks for custom build shipping was just ridiculous.,Macs have long set the standard for display quality in a notebook. They feature calibrated, high quality displays with the P3 color gamut and now, these displays are even better. With this year's MacBook Pro, the ProMotion feature (a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz--double the standard 60Hz, but also allowing even lower refresh rates when nothing is moving on the screen) that has long distinguished the iPad Pro line and this year the iPhone Pro finally comes to the MacBook Pro. The display can do HDR content with sustained 1000 nits and peak 1600 nits brightness. Supposedly, regular SDR content shows at the same 500 nits max as prior models, but subjectively the display does seem brighter and bolder than the 2019.,Apple says that the speakers and keyboard have been improved vs the Intel 2019 model, while the touchpad remains the same. The keyboard is visibly different--black instead of unpainted metal in between the keys--but structurally is still part of the unibody. Apple overstated the improvements in the keynote, but its certainly no worse than the Magic Keyboards used on the 2019 Intel model, and I do think there is more key travel and a bit more key noise than the 2019 MBP 16. The speakers are likewise just as good as before, and I do think they have a bit more power to them. They can easily rival my HomePod mini stereo pair for listening to music at my desk.,If you are on the Internet at all, you already know that this years models removed the Touch Bar and added a display notch. The thing is, it makes more sense to say they added rabbit ears because the notch area was always non-display, it just used to be part of the bezel. It only takes a small amount of menu bar space (if you are worried about that, I recommend Bartender 4 which can restore the old menu bar spacing and hide unneeded items). As for Touch Bar, I feel kind of bad for the few developers who really put a lot of time into it, but it clearly didn't take off and didn't make sense to keep investing in it. There were a few things I really liked such as the emoji picker (though it often froze while scrolling),On another note, the FaceTime camera is drastically improved (now 1080p) and among the best in a laptop. but still weak compared to an iPhone or iPad. Now that there is a dedicated notch area for camera space, I wish Apple would but the best-in-class cameras it already knows how to make on the Mac. Even the massive 12.9"" iPad Pro has the cameras from the iPhone now, so the Mac could too. I haven't tested the mics, but the marketing language is exactly the same as in 2019 so I doubt there are any substantive changes to the design.,Oh, and did I mention this laptop is SILENT. Like seriously, I have not heard the fans turn on yet. My Intel Mac was constantly running them and was too hot for bare legs during everyday web browsing, let alone anything ""pro."",I am definitely satisfied with the purchase, and I will come back to upload some photos when I get home.

  If one is buying this to use as a replacement for AirPods, think again. Not sure what the problem is, but the voice pick up by the microphones is very poor. Its as if I am talking in a large hall, and most of the time I cannot be heard at all. There are many who have complained about this on the web but there does not seam to be any credible fix from Apple. My first Gen Air-pods work very well after many years. I am a heavy user of Apple equipment and I expected this to work flawlessly, but as of now it's not the case. Apple needs to fix this issue as these do not come cheap either.

"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Honestly, the sound quality is great on these and everything about them is nice. Besides one thing lol. I read quite a few reviews about the V3’s being bigger and the definitely are.,One of the main reasons I liked airpods in the first place was because of the good fit they had with my ears, but these are definitely too big for me so I am returning them and getting a different pair., So, if you find this review and are looking for an upgrade, but are on the fence because of the size, please take my word for it and look at the V2s or Pros (if you like the silicone tips)
"
E. Young,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love the air pods. My reason for the 4 stars is I haven’t found a way to make them stay in my ears. The 2nd generation fit my ears better but are not as comfortable as generation 3. I’d prefer comfort. If I can find a way to make them stay in my ears they would be perfect no doubt.
"
Tyler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Another high quality set of buds from Apple. The pods fit comfortably in my ears and the sound quality for price point is solid. Music and phone calls come in great and fixed spacial audio is my favorite way to listen to digital music now. Ya can hear the bass just fine is these not too trebly either. Battery life is solid and the case is nice and small. If you can live without active noise cancellation I say go for it.
"
Nelson de Castro,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I know this will vary for everyone but the larger bud size in the 3rd gen just didn't fit my ears unlike the 2nd gen which fit perfectly.  Adding this feedback with the hope that the 4th gen will return to the 2nd gen size while building upon the features of 3rd gen.  Unfortunately I had to chose between proper fit and water/sweat resistance which I was looking forward to, and fit won out.

  These will kill your ears painful after a couple minutes and you just never get used to them. Terrible design noise cancellation is out the door. Last generation better. Plus I returned mine days ago and still haven’t received refund!
"
Eric Filipkowski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I hear these don’t fit well in some peoples ears, but they fit perfectly in mine. Other than the case being a little big there is nothing I would not recommend about these. I’m so glad they caught kept this design and didn’t switch to ear tips.

  These don’t even work with my iPhone not sure if the ones I got were fake but when I connect them it says headphones and not airpods and the tracking feature w find my iPhone doesn’t work. Either. These are completely useless and they are infuriating very low sound quality and NO TRACKING. LIKE HOW IS THIS AN APPLE PRODUCT. THERE IS NO NOISE CANCELING.

Dusty D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First ever review on Amazon. I came from Bose QC15's I bought about 8-9 years ago and decided it was time to get a new pair of over ear headphones. I'm a huge Apple fan and when Apple released the AirPods Max, I was very interested. Sure the price tag was expensive, but when I got these out of the box and put them on....the range, soundstage, and feel was incredible. Worth every penny.
"
Ginger Hagen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The AirPods Max are quality headphones. Amazing ANC, Spatial Audio, build quality, and connectivity. If you buy used like I did, the previous owner could have enabled lost mode, and will transmit location data to their Apple ID; be careful when buying used vs. new. Other than that, they have clean sound in the high and mid-range, but bass could be increased a moderate bit. Overall, not worth the $550 price tag, but if you can find it for less than $450, they aren't too bad. Found mine for $426 after taxes and discounts.

  I've used Bose noise cancelling earphones starting about mid 2016, and the noise cancellation on these in complex sound situations is just unbelievably excellent.  these are expensive, but, for me to work from home, very worth it.
"
John,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality and build are very good for the headphones  but I want to know what or who thought that the case was a good idea that come with these headphones . It’s like a bad joke. For the price that I paid for the headphones I would expect a real protective case. I would not recommend getting these headphones until Apple fixes the case and makes a real one.
"

  If you don’t have an Apple Watch or are thinking of upgrading then do it thank me later you won’t regret it! Yes I am aggravated like everyone else that there is not a adapter included and if you don’t have a USB-C 20 adapter you will need to get one make sure it’s from Apple and enjoy the super fast charging that won’t damage the battery.

"
Evan H.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had to return them because of a constant buzzing sound in the right ear. I'm not sure if Apple has fixed it in newer batches, or with a firmware update, or if this problem still exists. I actually went back and ordered the 2nd generation instead since they fit my ear better. I can't recommend the 3rd gen, just go with the 2nd gen or if you like the fit of the 3rd gen better then just go all out with the Pros.
"
Alex Lovett,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Connection not always the best same for certain sounds. They are great for in the car if you just want to listen to music or watch movies etc, I recommend over the head, make sure over the head has it so you can take calls
"
Maya,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The fit is everything. My 2nd generation pods were constantly falling out or pausing my music (the sensor is stupid sensitive). These airpods however, actually allow me to do things while wearing them! They can get crazy loud and the sensor only trips when you apply force to the pod vs the 2nd gen that would trip if the wind blew too hard!
"
Ashley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I still have my first pair of AirPods from a few years ago and saw that they released these this year and decided they looked decent enough to upgrade. While the battery life is increased and they are interactive now with touch, the actual ear piece feels too big almost for my ears which shocked me. I would have to say that the original gen of AirPods are far more comfortable than the 3rd generation. If you want to stick to comfort and less of a risk of one falling out somewhere, stick to the older generation.
"
Cool V,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'll be going BACK to the Airpod 2 cause they fit Waaaaaay Better and The Sound Quality is JUST as Good as the 3. ALSO its MUCH Easier with the the 2 to Skip Music or Pause with a TAP. On the 3 you have to Squeez on em which is NOT a Good Thing.
"
MOON,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Like it , because it has some nice new features but the biggest and important thing is the fitting of air pods. In 10 minutes they dropped from my ear three times. So uncomfortable since I got them didn’t wear second time. They should make it in smaller size not everyone has elephants ear. They are two big of the size.
"
GTML,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They are really great the sound is perfect, also they are original but if you have small ears this is not for you... I had to returned it because they were falling from my ears reason why I will order the AirPods Pro
"
Steve T,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They fit a bit bigger than the first 2 generations but still comfortable nonetheless. I much prefer earbuds without silicon tips so I returned my Pros and got the 3rd gen on sale, which is an amazing deal. Sound quality is on par with the Pros though slightly airy-er due to not being as sealed tight. Overall great upgrade from the prior generations if you have slightly bigger ears, only if you can get it for a largely discounted price (140USD). At the regular price, even if silicon tips aren't your thing, the Pros are a much bang for your buck at that price point.
"
LongLiveLee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have a set of 1st generation AirPods and they were beginning to fail.  During my workout the left side would lose connection with my iPhone after about three or four minutes.  My new 3rd Generation set works as expected though the fit isn't as good.  I don't think I try to jog using them.

  Could not be happier with these. I work in an office where noise can be an issue. I slip my headphones on, turn on noise cancellation and some soft music and I am transported away to a sound cocoon where I can blissfully focus on the work I need to get done. Absolutely in love with these and can't wait to try them on my 15 hour flight next week. Full disclosure - I have all apple products so the review is based on that. Have not tried them with any other brand of sound source.
"
William Serbia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple sure does know how to make this things sound good and build quality is truly superb.,It beats my Hifiman Andara’s in materials and built quality by a lot. However, I found the ear pads material a bit too scratchy for me so I bought a set of pleather replacements.,I keep these in our family room for when I want to have little noise free time watching a movie or listening to some music.
"
Bee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Adam Buth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are by far the best headphone I’ve ever had! The noise cancellation is phenomenal in my opinion. I love that they are not made of plastic and have weight to them. It makes them more secure so they don’t easily get moved while wearing them. Battery life is great so far and they work as well as you should expect a high end apple product to.
"
Aaron J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Nari Bre,5.0 out of 5 stars,
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this watch better than I even expected. I come from owning Android watches used on both Android and iPhone. I will list some pros and cons.,Pros:,Very comfortable,I like the OS on the watch,Software on the phone is good,Implementation of complications is good,Heath app good enough when compared to my Android watches,sensitive touch screen.,Charging speed.,Neutral:,Battery life. About average for a true smartwatch.,Cons:,1. No USB-C charger included. This is a star removal on its own. This is total garbage for something this expensive. They can use the excuse of minimizing electronic waste, but it is to save/make money.,2. None of my third party USB-C chargers (all output 15w or more) work for charging. However, my MacBook charger and MacBook itself charges the watch fine via its USB-C. So guess what, I have to buy an Apple branded charger.,3. Compared to my Android watches the amount of included watch faces is sparce, and the ones that are there are subpar in comparison. There are some good ones, but not as many good quality ones on Android.,4. No keyboard on the SE version. I have a keyboard on every Android watch I have owned, and that includes my cheapest one. Ones to download seem to cost, and want you to buy before you even try it out (unless I am doing something wrong here),5. Scribble is terrible. Get to a one, zero, etc, and good luck. For some apps you can't use voice, so scribble is a must. Can work fine with just using text if no characters, and if a number doesn't look similar to a number.,I love this watch, and it may not look seem that I like it due to the negative, but I really like this best out of every watch I have owned. It is missing basic features that my wife's less expensive, and very nice, Galaxy Watch 4 has at a much cheaper price, but with Apple it is what it is. No power brick or better 3rd party charging support is nothing new for Apple, but it does hamper the experience and satisfaction a bit.
"

  We have been buying gifts for everyone this year, so I bought this for myself and discovered I have great taste when giving gifts. Battery life could be better, but isn’t that true of everything?  It’s also a stealth way to appear disconnected, while still being in the loop. In short, an amazing device that you didn’t know you needed.
"
DanielPM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Un smartwatch con calidad desde su caja, hermoso, calidad de imagen excelente, se puede contestar mensjaes de WhatsApp, solo con la voz o escribiendo en el mismo reloj, se puede hacer llamadas directamente desde el reloj con Siri.. Se puede hablar y escuchar a través del reloj, se escucha nítido y ellos nos escuchan muy bien también, ideal para cuando estés manejando y no puedas usar el teléfono. Eso si, la batería dura 1 día, es como nuestros celulares que al final del día deben ser cargados, pero para las funciones que ofrecen vale la pena. Deberás tener un cubito de algún iPhone previamente para cargarlo ya que viene solo con el cable de carga, pero si ya tienes un iPhone podrás usar ese cubito. Adicional viene con 2 correas una M y una L para muñecas grandes si así lo requieren. Feliz con la compra
"
Nikki Wroten,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was definitely one of those people that was completely against getting an Apple Watch. I just felt like it was a huge waste of money. Although, after fiddling around with my mom’s Apple Watch SE (40mm) I knew I had to have one.,It’s so much more convenient being able to take phone calls without having to sprint like a track star to a separate room in order to be able to answer before the person calling hangs up. It’s also quite handy being able to stream music directly from my watch without having to carry around my massive Iphone.,I haven’t tried out the Sleep Tracker just yet because I haven’t been able to bring myself to sleep with it on as that’s just not my norm but I am working on getting used to having it on my arm at all times.,The build quality is glorious and the graphics on the screen are so crisp and clear. I will admit that the 44mm, in which I chose, can be a bit heavy on the wrist. I have kind of a bony wrist and it tends to shift directly onto my Pisiform Bone and that can be a bit of a bother at times but it’s more of a nit pick than a real problem.,The band I chose was the Nylon Sport Loop in Mazie/White. The color is immaculate and so whimsical but is a bit itchy to my sensitive skin, even when it’s not pulled too tight. I’d also recommend not getting any Nylon bands in light colors if you tend to get them dirty easily because this band will most definitely get filthy quick.,After all was said and done I paid a grand total of $336.00 for the Gold, 44mm, SE. I actually purchased it directly from the Apple Online Store and will preface that if you decide to do that, be prepared to wait at least two weeks, sometimes three depending on demand.,Mine shipped directly from the warehouses in China and took a week and a half to arrive. Whereas, my mother ordered hers from Amazon and received it within 2 business days.,I was told by an Apple representative though that ordering from elsewhere doesn’t guarantee you an up to date watch. My watch came with the new USB Type-C charging cable while my mother’s watch came with a regular USB cable. Also, my watch has the True Tone Technology while my mother’s just stays at either dim or bright at all times.,If you’re in the fence about this watch, just take the leap and get it while it’s still a bargain.
"
PJ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Although I didn’t buy it from Amazon, I don’t think that matters. Apple does not provide the proper charging equipment to use this device. I bought this for my wife’s birthday and she asked me how do I charge it and there was no hardware to do this with outbbuying more hardware/accessories. For that reason alone this product gets a one star for ruining my wife’s birthday. Sleep tracking blah blah blah Amazon wants me to mention this. Very disappointing.
"
Feedback,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered an Apple Watch SE directly from the Apple Store because they offered a trade in program.  Got notice today, they weren’t going to give me my trade in because the watch wasn’t wiped clean the way they wanted and did I want them to keep it.  There was no mention of this issue when they sent me instructions with the return box.  Now I am out $70, but the watch is coming back to me.  I will NEVER  place an order with this deceptive and corrupt place of business ever again!  I am shocked as I have always liked their products but their watches haven’t had the longevity of their other products and the Apple Store is awful!
"
Newday,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No idea if I like it because it arrives low on battery with no means to charge it. Very surprised this was not mentioned in the reviews. You must purchase a C block adapter for $20 to plug into the wall to charge the device. Was supposed to be a big deal gift at Christmas but quickly became a big disappointment when we learned it could not be used for lack of an essential component. Writing in hopes of saving you a similar disappointing experience.
"
Summer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Apple Watch is a very nice product and very useful. It is not heavy at all, sometimes I forget it's there. Getting the text and calls on it is nice so you don’t need to be by your phone 24/7. The Apple Watch has the do not disturb thing you can turn on which I love for when at work or school or dance. There is another fit bracelet called a fitbit zip. I know these are nice but I just don’t like them as much. You can’t get calls or text on them like you can on the Apple Watch. You can change the music on an Apple Watch you can’t on the fitbit. Now I know Apple watches are not cheap but in my opinion it is worth every penny.

  The right earphone charged fine. The left side would stop charging. I had to hold it for a while, basically pushing it down to make sure it would actually charge. In the beginning, I was unable to pair due to this. I chatted with Apple and then finally decided to try them individually to see if they each would pair. Overall, I am happy but spending this amount of money, I expect the charger to work fine. If it is a problem now, it will only get worse.

  I wanted to love these. I waited months for them. But they came out of my ears once on my Rougue Bike, again on my regular bike, and then I looked down at work and they fell out again. I’m returning to try the Pros. If those aren’t right I’ll go back to my trusted AirPods 2.
"
Kimberly K,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I thought these were AirPod pros because I purchased AirPod pros in Sept.  unfortunately I lost one😞☹️ I have apple care but it’s almost $100.00 to replace a single one.  I thought it would be better to get a set for a little more.
"
Erin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was honestly pretty shocked at how much larger the gen 3 AirPods were. With Gen 1 &2, I could workout in them, doing things like kettlebell swings… or just picking something up off of the ground. Unfortunately, with these, they fall out constantly, and the sound quality isn’t appreciably better to make it worthwhile.
"
KR1970,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Received these yesterday. Tried everyday to make them fit in my ears, including the recommended tilt up 20 degrees. After two days, I am sending them back and keeping my Airpods 2. These are a terrible design.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought a pair of these to use at the gym. Tried them once and am now in the process of returning them. Who designed these to be so big? They are heavy and clunky and fall out very easily. Also after wearing them for about 30 minutes my ears started to have pain. And apple released something about it saying to wear them consistently for your ears to adjust to them. No thanks, at this price they should not be painful and have to break in. Everything said, the sound quality was really good for some ear buds.
"
Veneco Fachero,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They work well and the battery life is actually very, very good, compared to other Air Pods, but the fit is very annoying. They're uncomfortable and almost unbearable to wear. I'd recommend just spending the extra bucks and buying the Pros.
"
Clark Dep,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Gen 3 sound quality better than 2,noise cancellation not good as Pro,battery life is better if your 2 using for few years,BIG problem is not comfortable as 2, exactly is hurt when you wear it for hours.,If your ear hole is smaller than normal people, here is the advise: don't buy it, BUY Gen 2.,Comfortable is the NO.1 option.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These might work if you didn’t like the first or second gen AirPods. But if you like the shape of the others then these aren’t for you. They worked fine but unfortunately we’re too big for my ears and kept falling out. Never had this issue with the first generation. Still waiting for Amazon to give us our refund for the return.
"
CES,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods don’t fit my ears correctly. After fidgeting with them for 2 days straight, I’m sending them back. I do have tiny ears, but I will also say that I’ve never had a problem with earbuds fitting my ears before, even after I got a daith piercing.

Juan J Herrera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great sounding headphones, especially when you get to watch movies with Dolby Atoms activated like in Disney+. These aren’t like beats that have heavy bass but rather it’s a cleaner sound with amazing highs and mids. If you thinking about listening to your lil baby, then you’ll be slightly disappointed with the bass. Noice cancellation is great, as well.

  Best anc wireless headphones hands down. Sound quality is superb especially when you connect with the wire. Also why it’s kind of annoying that the wire was not included. And that it costs $35… and that the wire is very cheap flimsy feeling. Hahah but the headphones are so good I don’t really care much.
"
Kris Hastings,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  One import thing to pay attention to.,If these are on sale on Amazon, it’s because they are nearing the end of the AppleCare+ Eligibility window.,When they arrived, which was same day. I only had 14 days to active AppleCare+ and didn’t know that, so I couldn’t get them with the additional warranty.,I’d recommend getting AppleCare+ at the same time if you are going to buy these when on sale.

  Bought these to upgrade from my last gen. Shorter stalk makes the buttons almost never work. Sound quality is modestly improved but barely noticeable to me. Battery life is improved. Wish they would have kept the length of the prior buds and functioning buttons. Not terrible, but not worth it.
"
Anonymous,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Much better sound quality than the AirPods 2, however, they fall out of your ears much easier.  Additionally, the left AirPod's bass became very noticeably distorted after a few weeks of use, even at less than half volume.,Update:  Just got a replacement and the left AirPod does not charge.  Amazon Support walked me through steps to reset them and now they won't connect to my iPhone.  Come to find out, you cannot reset your AirPods if one of them can't even connect to the case to charge.  Very disappointing.
"

"
Roman Prykhodko,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound - Warm and balanced. There's bass! These sound great for earbuds with no silicone or foam ear tips. It's very hard to get excellent sound quality without a seal in the ear and Apple has figured it out with these AirPods! Clarity isn't amazing, but that's a good thing because instead of boosting the treble to create fake clarity and ruin the sound, apple played the strengths of their driver and created a flat tonal curve. Makes listening to songs very enjoyable and not harsh nor muddy.
"

Annoyed Apple Buyer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I feels a bit ridiculous to review this $300+ piece of technology without having used it, but when it arrived today, it didn't come with a way to charge it -- nothing to plug into either a wall outlet or USB port. I've had tech gadgets arrive requiring batteries, but never something that required a specialized plug / adapter that wasn't included. I live in a rural location, which means the part isn't even available here. I'd either have to order the charger and wait for it to arrive or send the thing back. I'm opting for the latter. It's a bad sign when a company has clearly put so little thought into its users/buyers.

  I know a lot of people would much rather get airpods pro over the 3s, however the pros would make my ears feel really sore after a while. I had to downgrade to airpods 2, then airpods 3 came out and I decided to give them a try.,They're perfect for my ears, they don't hurt after a while and sound much better than airpods 2, there's also a nice improvement in battery life. Overall I'm really satisfied and would recommend them to those who can't really do airpods pro due to some kind of discomfort.

Carmmond,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don’t want noise cancellation because I use them at work. Fit is fine and they stay in without problems. I consider myself a normal build as far as ear size. Very happy with this purchase! Apple seems to have fixed the hinge flaking problem from the last generation of air pods.
"
Indra Diaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I think these are great, better even than the 2nd gen. the only problem is that the shape is different from 2nd gen and my ears are too small, so after some time the airpods start slipping out. other than that, their battery life lasts long and the bass is great.

  I have the Airpods 2nd Generation and this one is a big big upgrade to it! To me it's even better than the Airpods Pro. The only difference is the noise cancellation but this is so loud it cancels out the background noise just the same. It's loud enough! Don't think the Pro is better than this! It's really great!. Great Buy!
"
Carlos Zelaya Terrac,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Samantha,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So this is my first set of AirPods that I have gotten. I debated back and forth between the 2nd and 3rd gen. Opted with 3rd gen and sound was great, noise cancellation great, but I noticed they knew falling out my ears. Even with the slightest movement of just turning my headed . I was washing dishes today while on Ft and one fell out my ear.  I bent down today to pick something up and it fell out. So, I’m disappointed in that aspect because these will probably get lost very quickly if im not paying mind to them.
"
Jai,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was really excited to get these because the plunger style of the 2nd generation didn't really stayed in my ear like the 1st generation. So when I saw that they took the plunger piece away I was excited to get the 3rd generation.  Unfortunately they're too fat and every time my smile they moved my head they would slip out of my ears ache.  I will be returning these and going back to the 1st generation airpods.

Nari Bre,5.0 out of 5 stars,
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this watch better than I even expected. I come from owning Android watches used on both Android and iPhone. I will list some pros and cons.,Pros:,Very comfortable,I like the OS on the watch,Software on the phone is good,Implementation of complications is good,Heath app good enough when compared to my Android watches,sensitive touch screen.,Charging speed.,Neutral:,Battery life. About average for a true smartwatch.,Cons:,1. No USB-C charger included. This is a star removal on its own. This is total garbage for something this expensive. They can use the excuse of minimizing electronic waste, but it is to save/make money.,2. None of my third party USB-C chargers (all output 15w or more) work for charging. However, my MacBook charger and MacBook itself charges the watch fine via its USB-C. So guess what, I have to buy an Apple branded charger.,3. Compared to my Android watches the amount of included watch faces is sparce, and the ones that are there are subpar in comparison. There are some good ones, but not as many good quality ones on Android.,4. No keyboard on the SE version. I have a keyboard on every Android watch I have owned, and that includes my cheapest one. Ones to download seem to cost, and want you to buy before you even try it out (unless I am doing something wrong here),5. Scribble is terrible. Get to a one, zero, etc, and good luck. For some apps you can't use voice, so scribble is a must. Can work fine with just using text if no characters, and if a number doesn't look similar to a number.,I love this watch, and it may not look seem that I like it due to the negative, but I really like this best out of every watch I have owned. It is missing basic features that my wife's less expensive, and very nice, Galaxy Watch 4 has at a much cheaper price, but with Apple it is what it is. No power brick or better 3rd party charging support is nothing new for Apple, but it does hamper the experience and satisfaction a bit.

  We have been buying gifts for everyone this year, so I bought this for myself and discovered I have great taste when giving gifts. Battery life could be better, but isn’t that true of everything?  It’s also a stealth way to appear disconnected, while still being in the loop. In short, an amazing device that you didn’t know you needed.

  Un smartwatch con calidad desde su caja, hermoso, calidad de imagen excelente, se puede contestar mensjaes de WhatsApp, solo con la voz o escribiendo en el mismo reloj, se puede hacer llamadas directamente desde el reloj con Siri.. Se puede hablar y escuchar a través del reloj, se escucha nítido y ellos nos escuchan muy bien también, ideal para cuando estés manejando y no puedas usar el teléfono. Eso si, la batería dura 1 día, es como nuestros celulares que al final del día deben ser cargados, pero para las funciones que ofrecen vale la pena. Deberás tener un cubito de algún iPhone previamente para cargarlo ya que viene solo con el cable de carga, pero si ya tienes un iPhone podrás usar ese cubito. Adicional viene con 2 correas una M y una L para muñecas grandes si así lo requieren. Feliz con la compra

  I was definitely one of those people that was completely against getting an Apple Watch. I just felt like it was a huge waste of money. Although, after fiddling around with my mom’s Apple Watch SE (40mm) I knew I had to have one.,It’s so much more convenient being able to take phone calls without having to sprint like a track star to a separate room in order to be able to answer before the person calling hangs up. It’s also quite handy being able to stream music directly from my watch without having to carry around my massive Iphone.,I haven’t tried out the Sleep Tracker just yet because I haven’t been able to bring myself to sleep with it on as that’s just not my norm but I am working on getting used to having it on my arm at all times.,The build quality is glorious and the graphics on the screen are so crisp and clear. I will admit that the 44mm, in which I chose, can be a bit heavy on the wrist. I have kind of a bony wrist and it tends to shift directly onto my Pisiform Bone and that can be a bit of a bother at times but it’s more of a nit pick than a real problem.,The band I chose was the Nylon Sport Loop in Mazie/White. The color is immaculate and so whimsical but is a bit itchy to my sensitive skin, even when it’s not pulled too tight. I’d also recommend not getting any Nylon bands in light colors if you tend to get them dirty easily because this band will most definitely get filthy quick.,After all was said and done I paid a grand total of $336.00 for the Gold, 44mm, SE. I actually purchased it directly from the Apple Online Store and will preface that if you decide to do that, be prepared to wait at least two weeks, sometimes three depending on demand.,Mine shipped directly from the warehouses in China and took a week and a half to arrive. Whereas, my mother ordered hers from Amazon and received it within 2 business days.,I was told by an Apple representative though that ordering from elsewhere doesn’t guarantee you an up to date watch. My watch came with the new USB Type-C charging cable while my mother’s watch came with a regular USB cable. Also, my watch has the True Tone Technology while my mother’s just stays at either dim or bright at all times.,If you’re in the fence about this watch, just take the leap and get it while it’s still a bargain.

  Although I didn’t buy it from Amazon, I don’t think that matters. Apple does not provide the proper charging equipment to use this device. I bought this for my wife’s birthday and she asked me how do I charge it and there was no hardware to do this with outbbuying more hardware/accessories. For that reason alone this product gets a one star for ruining my wife’s birthday. Sleep tracking blah blah blah Amazon wants me to mention this. Very disappointing.

Feedback,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered an Apple Watch SE directly from the Apple Store because they offered a trade in program.  Got notice today, they weren’t going to give me my trade in because the watch wasn’t wiped clean the way they wanted and did I want them to keep it.  There was no mention of this issue when they sent me instructions with the return box.  Now I am out $70, but the watch is coming back to me.  I will NEVER  place an order with this deceptive and corrupt place of business ever again!  I am shocked as I have always liked their products but their watches haven’t had the longevity of their other products and the Apple Store is awful!
"
Newday,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No idea if I like it because it arrives low on battery with no means to charge it. Very surprised this was not mentioned in the reviews. You must purchase a C block adapter for $20 to plug into the wall to charge the device. Was supposed to be a big deal gift at Christmas but quickly became a big disappointment when we learned it could not be used for lack of an essential component. Writing in hopes of saving you a similar disappointing experience.

  The Apple Watch is a very nice product and very useful. It is not heavy at all, sometimes I forget it's there. Getting the text and calls on it is nice so you don’t need to be by your phone 24/7. The Apple Watch has the do not disturb thing you can turn on which I love for when at work or school or dance. There is another fit bracelet called a fitbit zip. I know these are nice but I just don’t like them as much. You can’t get calls or text on them like you can on the Apple Watch. You can change the music on an Apple Watch you can’t on the fitbit. Now I know Apple watches are not cheap but in my opinion it is worth every penny.

  I'm writing this review here because I can't get through to Apple. Do NOT buy this iPad. I purchased 2 of these, and the USB-C port on BOTH of them broke within a year. Apple wants $550 to fix each one of them, but I can't even send them in for repair because Apple requires you to erase the device before sending it for repair. With the broken USB-C port, I can no longer charge the iPad to power it on, let alone erase it- even through my account on Apple's website. I don't live near an Apple store, so unless I drive 2 hours to the nearest one, I now basically have two ~$1,000 paper-weights. Never. Buying. Another. Apple. Product. EVER!!!!

Vinny,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was upgrading from a Pro with home button. The new Pro does NOT support split keyboard which I have used since iOS 5, nearly 10 years. I find the new keyboard layout unusable. It is natural to hold the iPad in landscape position with thumbs on the sides but now the bezel is so small that your thumbs interact with the screen also rendering the device unusable. They expect you to use this with an iPhone style one-hand keyboard but after 10 years of using thumbs in split keyboard, this phone-style ""floating"" keyboard (if you can even call it that) is impossible. I bought from Apple store and returned it after 5 days of frustration. This is not the same class of device as ones with home button, this new kind is for quasi-desktop replacement, not for kicking back in your comfy chair and surfing, watching vids, playing chess, etc. I wanted Pro for the audio upgrade 4 speaker stereo. What a shame this new Pro kills the use-case I have been accustomed to.,In addition, there is no cable that supports the regular USB-A connector to your computer, I couldn't even restore so I could keep going where I left off. The supplied cable is USB-C to USB-C, completely useless on a Windows machine. I refuse to buy even more stuff just to use this, it's their flagship product, it should come ready to use.
"
Henry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have to laugh at the people who upgrade from a 2020 Pro to the 2021 and complain.  What?  You didn't  notice a difference from last year's to this years?  Duh!!  However, if you didn't already have a Pro and bought one now you'll be impressed with the speed of this thing.  I came from the 2018 and only bought this because my 2018 Pro screen was cracked, no longer on Apple Care and starting to not respond properly to the touch screen.  And I noticed the speed bump.  No - IOS 15 won't turn this thing into a laptop, but that's why Apple sells MacBooks and no amount of hoping will change that fact.  Is the M1 overkill for an iPad?  For 99% of people it is for sure and the Air will suit most peoples needs.,  Also if you're considering the iPad mini don't be put off by the idiots complaining about ""Jelly scrolling"".  As the owner of the new Mini 6 as well (I work in IT) it's complete idiocy.  Yes, it has a 60Hz display and if you really want to look for it you can see it, but in daily use will you actually notice it?  Not really, unless you actually can read articles while scrolling at high speed.  LOL. Some people are just boobs.
"
T-ACCT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had been eyeing a new iPad to replace my aging Air 2. Originally I was going to go with the Air 4, but the cost of the base-level Pro (11-inch, 128 GB) is only slightly more expensive than the 256 GB Air model. I felt like it was worth getting more powerful and future-proof hardware than extra storage (especially with cloud storage and USB options).,I’ve only been using the Pro for about a month and I can definitely confirm it’s powerful. I thought the Air 2 was a fast tablet, but the speed of the Pro is unbelievable. Apps open almost instantly, 3D scanning takes seconds, and even editing massive RAW photos in Lightroom was seamless. I haven’t tried to push the iPad to its limits, but so far nothing in my regular graphic design workflow has caused any kind of slowdown.,The battery life is also a major upgrade from my earlier iPad. I’m used to having to plug in my devices at the end of the day (or several times throughout the day in the case of my Windows laptop), but at the end of the day my Pro still has anywhere from 30-60 percent battery left. That’s with web browsing, drawing with Procreate, answering emails, etc. The battery does take a bigger hit with 3D and AR applications, but that’s nothing unusual.,I also love the screen of the iPad Pro. The 11-inch model doesn’t have the brand new HDR display that Apple advertises, but it’s still vibrant and bright. More importantly, the 120 HZ refresh rate really does make for a smoother experience. Drawing on the screen with the Apple Pencil is an absolute joy, and even just navigating around iPadOS with the faster refresh rate feels better. It’s hard to go back to the regular screen on the Air 2.,The downside to the latest hardware is that, while it’s incredible, the iPad feels limited by the current state of iPadOS. While I’ve fallen in love with using the iPad for graphic design projects, it still doesn’t have the pro-level apps that are on PC. Designers expecting a complete laptop replacement will probably be disappointed. Even so, iOS has plenty of unique apps that make the iPad a perfect companion to PCs and Macs. Procreate is my new favorite drawing app, and I’m discovering all sorts of unique apps that take advantage of the Pencil and AR capabilities. The iPad is really in a class of its own, it can do things that no PC (including the Surface) is capable of.,Overall, the new Pro hardware is probably a bit overkill in most situations right now. In terms of being future-proof, however, I can see it being well worth the money. This is the kind of hardware that will presumably last for years, and I’d expect that the app situation and iPadOS limitations will improve significantly once developers begin to take advantage of the M1 chip. The other iPad models are more than adequate right now (especially the Air 4), but anyone looking for the best iPad experience should definitely consider the Pro. I’m absolutely in love with using mine.
"
M,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's so odd to see so many people crying about how ""this is a bad upgrade! wahhh!""  If you don't need to upgrade, don't upgrade LOL.,Overall this has a number of improvements that can definitely be felt/seen.. esp with gaming.. i.g. genshin impact runs a lot better/cooler.,I definitely wouldn't buy an ipad pro for the MINI LED display.. it's nice, but def not worth a premium if it's not on sale.  All the older gens have a fantastic display.  Really wish the 11"" had a miniLED option.,As a first-time buyer of an ipad pro.. these 2021 version are extremely nice.  I would never want to buy the old version in 2021 unless I needed/wanted to save a few hundred $$ IF the 2020 version were discounted that much.. otherwise I don't see why anyone would buy the older models even if the 2021 version was 100-200 more, imo.,It's just funny seeing all these reviews crying about how they can't upgrade because it's not good enough wahh wahhh,That said, Apple really needs to stop being so greedy and allow all iPad pros to do more than they're able to do currently.  iPadOS holds back all ipads.. it's actually insane.  But Apple knows this and does it on purpose.  Sorta standard Apple practices.. they do pretty shady stuff tbh but most apple loyalist don't really care.. they just accept it.

  Lots of features, quick delivery.  My only complaint is that it was not clearly stated that you need to buy the charging block separately.  Why is this not disclosed before ordering?

  I find the AirPods 3rd gen to be a good choice. If you are in the market for some good and practical headphones, look no further. I've been using these daily, got no complains so far. If you are not the kind of person that needs ANC, you'll be satisfied with this purchase. I even like the smaller form factor better than the AirPods Pro. I was using the pros for 6 months and I wouldn't recommend those for daily drive.
"
Selina B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods are lovely and sounds great, but they never stayed in my ears. They are massive, and if I spoke with them on they both fell out within a couple seconds. I have a lot of ear piercings but have had no issues with other AirPod models fitting the correct way, so I do not think the small inner ear piercings I have were the issue. I was upset I ended up returning them, but they we far too uncomfortable. My rating reflects only the sound quality, not the fit quality.

Nancy E. Matthews,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Replaced original Ipad- resolution notably better-and more storage @256g vs. 16g- ipads same size but have to buy new case.But  negative to me is it uses USB-C  charger so (thanks ,Apple )for requiring buying new chargers. The Ipad comes with a very short power cord, so buy a longer one. I should’ve spent the extra $100 to get cellular+wifi instead of just wifi. Did not buy add on keyboard or stylus, which would add almost $300.00 and I don’t need. Battery life not impressive. My appreciation of Apple products is always dimmed by the irritation of built in obsolescence requiring new cases, chargers..
"
Thomas Bricker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been a iPad Pro 10.5 inch user for many years. This year I decided to upgrade to the 12.9 inch iPad Pro M1. I bought it and used it for a couple of weeks. I found the 12.9 inch to be overwhelming. It was too big, too heavy, too bright, too unwieldy and too expensive. I eventually sold it and bought the 11 inch iPad Pro M1.,Wow!,I absolutely love this 11"" iPad Pro!,It's just the right weight and size. It's very comfortable to use. The screen quality is off the hook. Super beautiful. I bought this one with the smart folio keyboard instead of the Magic Keyboard. I prefer the smart folio keyboard. It's more solid when you use the device. It's quieter and it has the ability to fold behind the screen if you want to use it that way. Much better than the Magic Keyboard. The Magic Keyboard is as heavy as the iPad itself (which is a bit silly if you ask me.) Makes the whole combination as heavy as a MacBook Pro.,Of course, functionality-wise the iPad is a dream to use. Super intelligent. Super elegant. Super fast! (M1),Love the abilities of the Apple Pencil. (Scribble is fantastic.) Because the screen now goes out to the bezel equally all around, it makes the screen feel significantly more useful than the 10.5 inch. I also like the fact of the 11 inch iPad is closer to 16:9 ratio. The iPad 12.9 inch is closer to 4:3. It just felt overly deep when I used it. The 11 inch screen feels better. Less like it's taking over your whole field of vision. Also the fact that the smart folio keyboard does not have a trackpad, is a plus in my opinion. The trackpad on the Magic keyboard makes the keys further away from you and makes the the whole iPad too large for the space in front of you. The smart folio keyboard does what you need it to do without getting in the way.,I cannot say enough good things about this device. It's one of my favorite Apple machines, and I have owned them all.,Highly highly recommended!
"
Gary C,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought this 256gb version to replace my 128gb 2017 Air. Noticeably more responsive and much smoother operation with no stuttering while surfing or scrolling.,I am however sending it back and have asked for a replacement due to a bright spot on the display around the size of a eraser head. Most noticeable on a light background but can be seen with other background colors as well. This is a known issue in the Pro model and also on the 3rd generation Air models and it seems like it has still not been corrected.,It’s one of those “I can’t unsee it” things that is hard to ignore. A rep was excellent and after a 15 minute “let’s try this” authorized a return and replacement with Amazon.,You cannot replace without calling and getting authorization for this item.

  This iPad used to be one of the best tablet out there but not anymore now.  Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+ beat this model by far.  Here is why:,1.  Better value for your money.,2.  Lighter and more portable with the keyboard case.,3.  Faster processing CPU and OS system (Tab S7 now with the newest chipset),4.  Tab S7 and S7+ is more laptop and PC-like experience.,If you are looking for an all-around tablet then Tab S7 and S7+ is the one.

  Procrastinating an iPad upgrade for 1.5 years and they weren’t quite what I wanted with each generational change.  FINALLY an iPad that can ALMOST replace my laptop/MacBookPRO!,Upgraded to 11’Pro 2021 256g from a 9.7’ 2015 Air2 (obviously a massive upgrade).  I was going to get the 12.9’ however I still wanted a “grab and go” tablet with the power of a laptop.  The 12.9’ doesn’t feel like a tablet.  I used my brothers 12.9’  for a week whilst he was on holiday.  It was a little awkward in size; now don’t get me twisted, the 12.9’ is as brilliant as the 11’ however for “ME” it didn’t have the feel of a tablet, felt like I was carrying around my MacBook Pro,It won’t replace my laptop just yet, but it’s soooooo close.  I’m VERY happy with the performance thus far.  The screen is amazing, 5G connectivity is brilliant, the battery life is incredible! I can’t pinpoint any disappointments, it’s truly an amazing iPad, no one will be unhappy with this purchase,Acquiring a magic keyboard in the upcoming week, that may be the game changer for me….

  I had a 2nd gen iPad Pro 12.9” version which I liked, but it was too bulky and the display was starting to fail.  I went to the Apple Store to compare the 11” display with the new 12.9”  XDR display.  Sadly, the 12.9” display was very nice and did in fact exhibit deeper colors and more contrast, but size was my main criterion so got the 11”.,The 11” display shows images as somewhat washed out.  Also, while I was expecting a significant increase in speed, that isn’t at all obvious with most apps, though it does process 360-degree images and video faster.  The 11” battery life seems worse than my old 12.9” (even after five years of use), and I find myself charging at mid-day which was never necessary before, though it can quickly recharge at 30 some Watts.  Overall, I’m basically happy with this 11”, but miss the display space of the 12.9” display.  I’d have to rate this “upgrade” as a solid “meh”.  Need an 11” XDR version.

  I bought this from Amazon Warehouse for $411 in “acceptable” condition. It was actually in perfect condition. The box was a little scuffed and had been open but other than that it was brand new. There were zero scratches and the battery is great!,I considered the iPad Pro for awhile but I’m glad I didn’t spend the extra money. I mostly use it for artwork with the Apple Pencil in Procreate software. Other than that, I just browse and watch movies. 10/10 I would absolutely buy it again.
"
Trevor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a beautiful iPad. The biggest drawback which overshadowed his great it is? The battery life. Horrendous. Disconnected from wifi, all apps closed and the screen locked = 40% battery gone in 7-8 hours. I’ve woken up twice with a dead iPad when I’ve set it down at 40%-45% battery left. Apple support has been no help, all they can say thru diagnostics is the battery itself is good, it’s a “software problem”. I’ve followed all steps to potentially fix it and nothing has worked. Hugely disappointing on an iPad that’s brand new and costs $700.,Desperately needs an iOS update to address this.

  Super clear & clean images. Easy to navigate as if using iPhone (have iPhone 12 Pro Max). Connected quickly to my internet. Transferred seamlessly from iCloud. I got the green one. I wear hearing aids and they connected quickly to the iPad and the sound is great. Downloaded my iTunes library and navigation is smooth finding my fave tunes. Battery life is very good. Looking next to get the Apple Pencil and ProCreate app for doodling and creating images. I’ve been skeptical of Apple because of the expense. But I had to get new hearing aids and they have Apple software to connect to Apple products. I am impressed with the ease of use and sound quality. I am now able to chat and hear what is being said with FaceTime. The iPad Air gets an A++ from me.
"
S HEPNER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The ipad air 4 is IMO the best bang for buck for something that is both a great tablet, and even laptop. I use the apple pencil and logitech combo touch case, so together the whole system came in at under 1000 dollars and it has the same form factor as my work’s Microsoft Surface without all the bugs! 10 hours+ of heavy use battery life, and it works seamlessly to tether off of my iphone. I’m not sure why anyone would buy the LTE version… I use the trackpad with the combo touch and most apps integrate its function well. I probably use the trackpad for 80% of what i use this tablet for, everything else is done with the pencil or touch. The gestures and keyboard hotkeys work great on the iOS platform.,Multitasking capabilities on the ipad allow me to use this almost like I would a laptop. I can video chat, text, email, browse the internet, etc. all at the same time with at least 2 apps/windows up at a time. The only limit I’ve found (at least with FB messenger video) is that if I’m multi-tasking, the video feed cuts out to my friends, but I can still see their videos.

H. Hanford,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this just recently, and it's taken me a few days to warm up to it.  I miss the old Home button on my old iPad Air (circa 2015). But, it was time to upgrade because my old one was running very slowly.  This beautiful iPad works amazingly fast, has all the features and apps I want, and a large screen that I can read my eBooks on comfortably.,It's taken me a bit to figure out how to close apps, but you just swipe up from the the bar on the bottom, then hold the app to ""hide"" it.  It seems like there should be a better, faster way to close all the apps, but I haven't found it, yet.  I'm not worried, though and you shouldn't be either.  This is a great value for the money, and a fantastic machine.  I'm very happy with it.  Highly recommend.

  Save your money and get last year’s model! I’m the type that gets a new iPad each year. This is the first time I feel like pumping the brakes. The hardware is now complete overkill and the only real selling point from Apple. Software needs at least 3 years to start catching up. Even iOS 15 isn’t ready for this new iPad.

Roger J. Buffington,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  In my opinion, for many users the iPad Pro 11 is the ultimate and perfect iPad.  The screen is stunning, and the CPU is blazing fast.  With 2TB of memory, this is a very powerful computing device.  I really like the 11 inch size.  It is large enough for my demanding uses but still leaves the unit small enough to be handy to pack up and take anywhere.  With the Magic Keyboard unit, which also functions as a case, this iPad is a powerful notebook computer that does it all.  Yes, I am enamored with this iPad!  Highly recommended.  RJB.
"
J. Templin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No complaints about the product per se, but the advertising here is deceptive and you may think you're getting a separate keyboard/stand. You're not. Do your research. There are ones you can buy to use with this for an extra cost. The apple ""Magic"" keyboard is outrageously expensive. There are cheaper compatible ones that should meet most anyone's needs. Again, do your research/search. Just sayin' ...  Otherwise, this is a five star computer device.
"
Alexander Kuznetsov,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought an iPad Pro on the Apple website a little more than a year ago. Spent well over a $1,000 with accessories included. After very light use, the iPad stopped charging. The store staff (on Michigan Ave in Chicago) said the charging socket broke down because ""the device is not meant to be used while charging"" and demanded $500 for a fix. No excuses, zero willingness to find a reasonable solution, obscene level of indifference. With all respect to the legacy of Steve Jobs, Apple has become an extortion machine with not even a hint of innovation. I was planning to buy two new iPhones and a next-gen large iMac, but I am taking my business elsewhere.

  Just upgraded from a 6th generation iPad 9.7.  Here are some observations after a few minutes of use.,+ Speed is off th charts.  Much better than my 2015 and 2017 Mac Book Pros and previous IPad.,+ Better audio,+ Face ID,+ Slightly better graphics,+ Extra screen area,+ No home button.  Don’t miss it.,- A slight loss in portability.  It is dimensionally slightly larger than the iPad 9.7.  However I think the trade off is worth it.,Tried using it as a computer with a keyboard and trackpad but much prefer it as an IPad.  It will never replace a desktop computer since the software I need are either not available on IOS or are defeatured versions of the desktop apps.  I love IPad for what it is.  Really loving the upgrade.  Still can’t believe how fast it is.

  This is a nice tablet.  I have had Android phones and tablets in the past - this is my first Apple product - figured I'd give it a try.  It works well and has a nice screen.  I didn't know that Apple products with no data plan won't allow you to receive or send text messages from or to folks that don't have an Apple device.

jessicameaghan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s a great iPad if you don’t want to do things like transfer music stored on your iPhone, or back up documents to any cloud service other than iCloud, or even just simply back up to your iCloud account (the file sizes are absurdly large so you will need to pay the monthly fee for more storage). It’s marketed as a replacement for a laptop which is absolute false advertisement. I’m stuck with what basically amounts to a fancy kindle+drawing pad with minimal ability to do much else. Would not recommend for anything beyond the traditional uses of an iPad before they got more sophisticated.
"
Ekaterina Puffini,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have an older ipad air. I use it every day as a Kindle and general internet access point. So I thought to buy this as a spare. Very vexing that it uses the USB-C connector cable and the old one the lightning connector cable. Great. I now need 2 different cables. And, of course, the old ipencil doesn't work with the new model. Great. I now need 2 ipencils.,Apart from this, it seems to work as well as the old one.

Alan Reinhart,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had been lusting for a Pro for years, and when my Air 3g failed, I bit the bullet.,What a freekin disappointment!,First up is the insanely clumsy 2-button power-down. Next comes the VERY stiff sleep & volume buttons. Not at all easy to use. You have to press quite hard to get a response.,Getting see the apps loaded in memory is also a huge PITA. I usually have to try 4 or 5 times to get to show. The “flick” operation is not very clear.,Battery life is nothing to shout about- very similar to my (now discontinued) Air 3g.,I guess since I’m not an artist doing graphics the whole Pro-thing is a waste.  Wish I had gone for a refurbished Air (4g)…. Would have saved a bunch!,At least the sound is good. That’s something… not sure if worth the big price tag.

Annoyed Apple Buyer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I feels a bit ridiculous to review this $300+ piece of technology without having used it, but when it arrived today, it didn't come with a way to charge it -- nothing to plug into either a wall outlet or USB port. I've had tech gadgets arrive requiring batteries, but never something that required a specialized plug / adapter that wasn't included. I live in a rural location, which means the part isn't even available here. I'd either have to order the charger and wait for it to arrive or send the thing back. I'm opting for the latter. It's a bad sign when a company has clearly put so little thought into its users/buyers.

  We looked hard for the ""jelly scrolling"" issue that others are mentioning and while we can see it, we don't find it to be a deal-breaker in any way.  Maybe it's because we're old-school and accustomed to waiting for tech to catch up with us.  That little instantaneous flicker doesn't have an adverse effect on our experiences, though we can see where others could be.  After discussion, my spouse and I are guessing that those who are sensitive to the flickering of fluorescent lighting are likely to be effected, among others who have heightened visual sensitivities.,This is a lovely little machine.  We purchased it someplace in person and immediately found that we made a mistake and needed to order the cellular model instead, so while I am waiting for Amazon to send it, we've,  been playing with the WIFI version as we have a two week window to return it open box.,Personally, I love that it easily fits in my mini backpack and does so much more than any other portable device I've ever owned, I almost feel overwhelmed.  As Star Trek devotees, we think the handheld profile it boasts is a fantasy come true.  My first computer cost $1,700 and came in two huge and heavy cardboard boxes with cow paint all over them.  This little beauty is like alien technology compared to that computer.,It's small and sleek and very elegant looking.  It's a comfortable fit in my hands for viewing and typing.  It’s laid out like my phone and gives me see much more space to do the things I want to do, without torching the battery in my phone.
"
Lance,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Don't spend your hard earned money on this. The jelly scrolling display is unacceptable for this price point.  My $190 Samsung LCD screen tablet doesn't jelly scroll whatsoever. Apple is full of it to say this is ""normal"" for LCD screens. It's poor engineering and a real shame coming from a company like Apple that usually makes spectacular tablets.
"
Dominic Bialek,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This tablet is my dream tablet. I have been waiting years to have a mini form factor with the best that Apple can do. The price was just right for something that will last for years and never slow down to the amazing A15 chipset. The screen is fantastic and the battery life is surprisingly amazing. Even beats out the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Air with screen on time according to YouTube battery tests. UI is snappy and the Apple Pencil Gen 2 support is such a fantastic tool to use. I love this tablet and would recommend this to anyone. I did get the 64GB model because this tablet is for document editing and watching YouTube and Anime. However, if you are a heavy user I would recommend the 256GB model. The colors could be a lot better, but besides from that I have no complaints. As well, ignore the jelly scrolling bad reviews. Majority of those reviews have no idea what they are talking about just bandwagoning a problem that is not an issue.

  This mini ipad 6 is perfect. It has the A15 chip, full screen display, usb-c and a new design. I’ve always thought the other iPads were too large for what I needed. I can hold this with one hand. The performance is outstanding. The speakers are on each side and had much better sound than the mini 5.

  Wonderful upgrade for myself and my students.  Ordered five 256gb and these are indeed the newer batches as described by various vloggers on YouTube.,Impressive battery life and Apple Pencil two precision is flawless with every app we have tried.  Takes a little get used to the volume buttons on the top left - but no reason to deduct any stars.  Could not be any happier.,Five stars.,Make sure your iPad mini 6 ends with serial number VQ5 or newer.  The difference in screen scrolling speeds and reduced jello effect is dramatic.,Happy holidays Amazon family.

No Dice,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't know about the jelly scroll problem, my vision apparently isn't that good (?). That aside, this is one the best tablet updates I've seen in a while from anyone. Granted I'm not brave enough to venture into Samsung land with its 18,000 varieties of tablet, but if they did have the greatest tablet ever made, who would know? The speed is good, the battery life is good, the pen is awesome, the bezels are great (as opposed to the coke-bottle-glasses design of previous versions). Overall, the redesign is really good. I was kind of afraid it wouldn't be after seeing the new M1 iMac (blech).,My only real issue, besides the price (holy smokes), is the power button and fingerprint reader. I have so many questions about this choice. When are we getting Face ID on all tablets, especially at these prices? Why is the new button slower to unlock than the old fingerprint scanner? 3. For a company that seems to hate buttons, why don't they just add a haptic feedback mechanism similar to the one in the iPhone? Why not combine the weirdly placed volume buttons with the fingerprint scanner and allow us to drag our finger across to change the volume (psss, Android devices have had a feature like this for years). Finally, given how often they keep reminding us that they are the industry leader--nigh, the intergalactic leader in secure personal devices, why do they continue to limit how we choose to secure our devices? Why not offer Face ID ***and*** a fingerprint scanner? On a phone, I get that there is limited space. But on a tablet or laptop, what's the holdup?,Yes, I'm secretly hoping Apple will read the previous messy idea and add it in a later iteration. As of now, it's a great tablet, and I'm just glad that they are designing their products again rather than just changing the chip and calling it ""Mission Accomplished"" year after year. Now, about that over 10-year-old Mac mini chassis...
"
Rayto,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I actually own this device and am reviewing it based on my use case; reading, navigation, photography and gaming. I've owned every mini other than the 5. I've owned near every iPad, now an 11” iPad Pro. My Mac is an M1 Macbook Air.,Pros: Its a little monster. In Lightroom, can load, import or export pages of thumbs and it just gets in done quicker than my M1 Macbook and as quick as my iPad Pro. Never runs short on ram no matter how many browser pages of images I open.,Cons: The sharp edges get old fast, they are not comfortable. Fingerprint reader/ power button is large and easy to push. If you're a landscape user, expect to repeatedly sleep your mini during use. If you game, expect you'll sleep it (second time I've done it writing this review) a lot. This is the sort of poor execution, or arrogance, I see more and more at Apple. Did anyone actually use this product when it was in its design stages? The new display aspect ratio cuts off the bottom edge of some web page layouts. Annoying to have to scroll just to respond to a cookie request. Aspect ratio also cuts off all but the first line of sub-titles. Again, what's going on at Apple? Due to a poor grip (sharp edges and button placement) it feels a lot heavier than it is. Older mini's are heavier yet feel lighter. My 11” iPP feels heavier but nicer in hand.,I see zero jelly scroll. I'm a landscape user and no matter how fast or slow I scroll, both sides scroll totally linear.,While not the mini itself, don't buy the Apple Smart cover. The magnet is weak and the iPad slips out at times. But the magnet is strong enough to make separating the cover from the back a royal pain of fiddling until you can close it. Hint for the guys: grow long fingernails. The edges are sharp and uncomfortable.,I returned the mini 6 after 2 weeks of trying to come to terms with it. Fortunately found a new mini 5, 256 that’s in the mail.

Scott Harris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This thing just feels right in the hand. You can use it one handed and two handed really freely. Portrait and landscape both feel great. This is the best device for note taking or reading manga without a doubt. I also love it for content consumption and video calls. I carry a portable folding keyboard and trackpad from iclever and I can easily use it as a work device. Jump desktop turns it into a full on computer as well capable of streaming gaming or work. The Apple Pencil works flawlessly with this device and the pocketablility is incredible. This is the best iPad hands down. It’s no laptop, but it’s a great iPad.

  Warning, do not buy any Apple products that have been listed by Amazon as used without being aware that you may have no warranty.  The warranty starts from the original sale date of the device, not when you buy it.  If you have a problem with the device and it sat on the shelf for a while, you may have little or no warranty left.  There is no way to know this until you call Apple with the serial number.  Amazon is not able to to extend the warranty and you are stuck with a defective device with no recourse.  I bought 4 of these.  I really wish I had just bought new, but on other products I have not run into this issue.

  After saving up for months, I was fortunate to purchase this product. I found the deal on Amazon, with a discount due to Father’s Day and I believe a Memorial Day sale. Purchasing this iPad has been a great thing. As a college student, I take this everywhere I go. It is very light weight, and a very smart device. Once I turned it on, it connected with my apple account and set up my apple wallet. I use this device for taking notes, watching videos, and listening to music. The speakers on this thing are great. The color is fine, a little light. I recommend purchasing the Apple Pencil right off as it goes extremely well, and along with a screen protector. Overall, I am so content with being able to have purchased this device. Happy customer here!

Jayme,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had this for about a week and it is AMAZING! I've always hated IOS but the iPad with the Apple Pencil 2 is truly creative and exceptional.,There are a few issues with the features, such as no Face ID so I have to manually enter my passcode, or use my fingerprint. It's not a big issue but depending on how you're sitting or laying adjusting your finger to the right position can be uncomfortable and inconvient.,The positive is that even drawing or writing on the glass top with the pencil is easier than it was on previous models and gives some friction so you can write or draw the way you want to. Battery life is good but I always charge it at night so I'm not sure what the overall battery life is. The magnetic side for the pencil is Great! But can only be set to 1 side of the iPad. Sound quality is excellent.,Overall I give the iPad Air 5-stars! And a must for anyone!

  I’ve wanted to get off the google tablet teet for some time now for reasons that are best discussed in other venues. But my first apple experience is within the newest iPhone 11, so that experience helped me adjust to the iPad platform. Yes there’s a learning curve between the iPhone 11 and this tablet, but it’s not really steep at all. What you can’t figure out is easily answered by hitting the net and searching. Trust me the answered show right up for questions of basic operations. Screen and image quality.....well if you compare it to my 8yr old Samsung galaxy tab, well there is nothing to compare really.This ipad outshines it. My cousin who is an apple nut says that its super impressive. My issue now is moving things such as photos from the Galaxy tab. Its definitely doable but its also not as simple as one would think if you don’t have a pc with the itunes installed (which I do not). I have no need for a pc. ....yet.

  This is a review of Apple iPad Air (4th generation),This is a holiday present; however, I had to take it out, make sure it worked, and load some software on it.,I have similar one that is about a year old.

It comes with Touch ID, and a USB connector for charging and accessories.,One amazing machine.

The new charging cable not being ‘lightning’ and are USB-C now did throw me off at first, but it’s obviously not really an issue. The keyboard is also USB-C so it works perfect together! The iPad does not have face recognition (unlock) so that was kind of a bummer but it really doesn’t cause a big issue. It does have fingerprint on the power button, which works great, I find myself most times just typing my password in though. Overall I love it!

  It is light weight and a very comfortable size.  That said, Apple holds a tight grip on everything.  That means there is no real way to adjust the color settings or whiteness of the screen.  You can with the Galaxy S7 and S7+.  The picture on the Galaxy, especially the S7+ is far superior with crisp colors and white whites.  You can also adjust it warmer or cooler, but not with the iPad.  The sound from the iPad Air 4 is a real problem.  It is bright with a high amount of sibilance (hissing Ss) when people speak.  The problem is, unlike the Galaxy, there is no available EQ app that works across the board from everything from movies to Pandora.  They all try to direct you to Spotify and Apple Music.  There are many other services.  With the Galaxy, the EQ works for all.  The iPad speed Air 4 speed is very good, but for me, that is where it ends.

  This is my first iPad since maybe the first gen iPad?? It is great! But I have one caveat: I wish I got the 11” Pro simply for the face recognition. My phone is an XR and has face recognition, and after you get used to that it is kind-of hard to go back to fingerprint. To be honest I think I really liked the idea of the pretty colors!! Also I felt if I got the Pro I should get the larger screen, and that was just too expensive. Turns out this screen size is fine for me - I haven’t been unhappy with the size at all, maybe because it is so crisp and bright.,I also got the 2nd generation pencil and the magic keyboard, because I wanted to replace my aging MacBook. It took me a while to get used the different ways you interact with an iPad, but now that I’m used to it I love it and use it pretty exclusively.,Anyway, very happy with my purchase!

  This iPad is better and faster than iPad Pro 2020, but it's a useless upgrade and waste of money. There's no apps to take advantage of the Apple M1 processor, it would be good if Apple make Final Cut Pro or upgrade iMovie with new Pro features.
"
Mike McCurdy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Tremendous machine. I am upgrading from a 9.7 iPad from a few years ago, so this is a huge bump up. Much faster, thinner, better display, battery life, etc. The M1 is really something and the WiFi connection is much zippier too. Ignore 1 star reviews saying this is a needless upgrade.

Veedubau,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I returned a Mac Book Pro and got this! I will say without a doubt in the last decade this is the one device that I purchased that has never made me  regret it at any point.The screen is beautiful speakers have great sound compared to any other hand held device on the market and it is lighting fast. This iPad also has the ability to us a keyboard and mouse if you would like which makes it much more versatile. Also great for Xbox gaming if you do remote play it streams effortlessly and the screen size makes it more immersive than a cell phone.

  A super purchase which has basically replaced all my other computers and tablets. So easy to use and beautifully built. It is like my right arm now...don't know what I would do without it. Well worth the investment as it will give you years and years of enjoyment and utility. Though a bit on the expensive side, quality is quality, and it it well worth the price. I would recommend it to any of my friends!

Robert Breedlove,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Felt compelled to write a review saying that multiple reviewers are saying that the 3rd Gen iPad Pro 11"" is outdated and the newest one is 5th gen.  THIS IS NOT CORRECT!  The current iPad pro lineup includes an 11"" model (3rd gen) and a 12.9"" model (5th gen).  It's a shame to see people leaving negative reviews when they don't know what they're talking about.,This is the newest model and it works really well.

  Lots of features, quick delivery.  My only complaint is that it was not clearly stated that you need to buy the charging block separately.  Why is this not disclosed before ordering?  Why is it not offered when placing the order?  I went to three different stores before I was able to find the proper charging block.  Some places ""out of stock""!  Very frustrating!!!!  Other than that I am happy with this purchase.

  This is undoubtedly the best headphones I have ever had. Only one thing I’d like to add is that they do not have noise cancellation for other people when I’m on the phone. I think this is a very simple feature to add assuming the price of headphone. Come on. Other than that thumbs up.

Ted draper,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have never had this happen before, but the first air pods my daughter received stopped working after a couple days by glitching out to anything. I got a replacement and when my daughter opened the box, it was missing the left air pod. Never has this happened before. I'm returning for a refund. I know Apple is a good product and normally we are very happy with our purchase, but not this time.
"
Bisou,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had high hopes for theses as I love my old 2012 wired earbuds, but I think my ears are too small and the wrong shape because these fall out immediately. If you have larger ears I could see them fitting perfectly but if your ears are on the smaller side, no. Returning for the Pros, hopefully the small silicone tips will fit!,Sound - I only tried them for a couple minutes but they sounded great, but had to almost hold them in my ears so they wouldn't fall out.

  Bought these as new and they in fact were not new. They were connected to someone else’s Apple ID when we tried connecting for the first time. After further review, the tabs to pull to open the seal were not there. The box was in great shape and no indication someone else had used them until trying to connect, and then the further inspection from the Apple Store we went to to double check if we could get them to take off the ID.
"
Cheri Vaughn Landers,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ordered them for myself and they stated that they were new but if they were new it didn’t show they came with some type of residue on one of the ear pieces and also the static was awful so I’m returning them and have got me a pair of the 2nd generation ones that was a much better decision.

  I own 13 Apple products amongst our family. I bought this thinking I'd use it. My iPhone is ALMOST the same size so I ended up giving to my daughter.,Bezels are HUGE!,Just an HONEST review from an owner. I bought for less right when it came out, and it should be priced like the 10 inch iPad 9th gen inmho.
"

  Expecting great things from this upgrade, but disappointed.  I have a IPad mini 5 and am sticking with it.  I did not experience the jelly roll, but apps would often open in 1/3 at a time.  Download is poor, and we have 400 mbps.  Tested the download against available speed.  Too expensive for an engineered problem machine.  Will see if they come out with an ‘ S ‘ version that corrects the problems.
"

  It is real but many users - myself included - don't notice it at all in regular use. You really need to try it for yourself to see if it's an issue for you. I love mine - it's a great portable complement to my 2021 12.9 iPad Pro.
"
Xavier,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this tablet direct from apple, and it’s amazing! The all screen design is like having an iPhone, but the amazing versatility of IPad OS, I was worried it would be too small when I traded in my 10.2 inch but I was quickly proven wrong, the screen is just right for me, and it gets the same 10 hour battery life which is amazing, it truly is all day. When I purchased it, I got the one with cellular, and it’s just outstanding to throw in a bag, and it’s lightening fast too. Gonna be honest, the Touch ID sensor messes up sometimes which is kind of annoying, but other than that the tablet is super great. If you buy it get the CELLULAR model, it’s worth the extra money you won’t regret it!
"

  I’m a senior so maybe it won’t bother everyone but the Jelly Scrolling stopped me from keeping it. Too bad, otherwise is a very nice product. Apple’s response to the complaint  is regretful. Sad! I own 6 other apple products. I’m a big fan.

   Although the purple seems a lot more grey in person, which could be somewhat due to the lack of daylight, the color is still subtle and pretty. The size is perfect. The lightness along with the size  makes it so easy and comfortable to hold, while not feeling like your sacrificing any screen since it feels plenty big and immersive. It’s like a big iphone. I already see myself gravitating towards this iPad instead of my Pro 12.9 especially when sketching.,Edit: updated with pics in day light and the purple is a lot brighter.
"
Elizabeth Kohlstaedt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Why does Apple change what works?  The fingerprint on the top instead of center bottom does not work well, especially with a screen protector, and having to swipe to go back to main screen just adds fingerprints to screen. And they changed the charger attachment so that it doesn’t work with other Apple products!  I wouldn’t buy this again.
"
TCTxPhoenix,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a replacement for a 2018 iPad Air. I do not like the lack of headphone jack. The Bluetooth transmission of audio to my HD Bluetooth / headphone amp combo does not produce the sound quality of direct connected Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 300 ohm headphones. The screen is fine, the processing power is much better than the older model I own, but I'm really unhappy about the sound quality. I stream lossless audio from Primephonic. It's not so lossless when it passes through the iPad Air.
"
Herdnerfer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Screen starting to go out on my 2018 iPad Pro, and I didn’t want to pay the price they are charging for 2020/2021 models. So I opted for the iPad Air 4.,Pros:,Feels just as fast and productive as my iPad Pro,TouchID works even better than FaceID in this form factor IMO. Don’t have to make sure I’m staring at my iPad when I want to unlock it, nor do I have to worry about blocking the camera.,Just as loud as the 2018 iPad Pro. This was my biggest worry, as it only has 2 speakers instead of 4, but I, happy to report I don’t notice any difference in the audio quality/loudness.,Cons:,Lack of ProMotion is noticeable.,Doesn’t seem as bright when using outside.
"
Alan Lopez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What can I say, it's the iPad pro lite.,Surprised that this can handle 4k video editing. I mostly use it to take it on the go and draw with my apple pencil. The touch ID and definitely a missed feature and don't mind it on the power button. USB type C is a game changer. Originally I was going to buy the Samsung galaxy tab s7 since it was cheaper but then I remembered that with Apple you pay for literally what you get. Apple is solid when it comes to their chipset. Their build is definitely designed better. Also it's Apple, they have it priced that way for a reason. I use this mostly as a drawing tablet on the go. Got procreate, but clip studio is definitely much worth it. Excuse me while I go back to drawing
"
Ben O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bigger, lighter, faster, and nicer than the regular iPad. Also more expensive than a regular iPad. Why get this one? It’s easier to find! It’s also future proof by at least 2 years over the regular cheaper iPad. The processor is the exact same Bionic A14 that you find in an iPhone 12. The regular iPads come in with an A12, 2 generations back. I imagine the next iPad release will have an A13...while the Air, without even getting a refresh for a year would still be faster than the latest and greatest regular iPad.,For me, I don’t like upgrading every year. At the current pace of refresh, the regular iPad has at least 2 more releases before it even matches the speed of the Air, so basically 2 years ahead. Be lazy, be future proof, buy the Air

  So I ordered this directly from Apple and after 9 days waiting they still had not even begun to process my order. Then I saw it on Amazon, $50 cheaper and 2 day shipping!! Gotta love Amazon! Note to self: always check Amazon first!!,  This iPad Air is great. Bought this as a replacement for my big old 2010 MacBook Pro which still works like new, (and is  still 10X faster than any windows machine) I just don’t need a big computer anymore and my iPhone is too small for my old man eyesight for somethings like reading and such. I  Love Apple products, they just simply do what they’re supposed to do year after year without fail. You get what you pay for 😊

  My wife's previous iPad Air 2 tablet was having significant problems holding a charge and kept shutting off on her. We replaced it with this iPad Air 4th generation 256GB version. I'm not much of an Apple fan and pretty much use Android devices and a Windows desktop, so I can't get too excited about the iPad Air 4. It works. It's battery seems to last a long time. The screen is great. And most importantly, my wife is happy with it. That makes me happy.

  I was having one of those days that you want to get home soooo bad because it’s such a bad day and you keep looking forward on one specific thing. I got my iPad, put all the accessories on it, everything looked legit and was super excited to try out the pencil, charged the iPad for about 15 minutes since it wasn’t turning on, no even the battery dead signal. Charged for 1 hr after not turning on after 15 mins. Started to worsen my mood because no matter what I did and tried it would turn on. got in contact with amazon help thing and they really helped me and understood my disappointment and frustration. I understand one in the batch has to be bad. I was really looking forward to it but Amazon really helped from the start. Will buy it somewhere in store since I need it for school and can’t wait for another shipment.

Gabe,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  There’s a few things I love about this iPad Air over the iPad Pro. First being the weight, it’s very light and can be held with one hand easily. Secondly the bezels are a little larger than the iPad Pro which to me is a step in the right direction. The reason being is that it gives your palm space to grip the side without covering the edge of the display. Third of all it’s got some decent sounding speakers for what they are. And last but not least the display is very sharp and has great color accuracy. I hope that Apple considers this bezel design for the iPad Pro because it’s definitely much better for holding in the hand. This iPad Air was a great buy and I definitely will be holding onto it for years to come!

  With Android camp abandoned tablet market and Samsung producing narrow, suitable for video only tablets with 16:9 or 16:10 tall ratio there is a huge glaring hole for people who are in need of small handheld portrait orientation tablet with squarish ratio of 4:3 or let's say for comparison sake 16:12 screens. Galaxy tab S2 8"" (mini clone) was not updated since 2015 leaving Apple Ipad Mini as only choice. Reluctantly i ordered one. Ahhh... two issues personally for me: 1) Old Mini 5 and Galaxy Tab S2 had 16:12 screens while new one has 16:10.5 which is much less comfortable for me for Ebook reading and Internet browsing while in bed. Pity. 2) That infamous jelly scroll defect. Let me put it straight. Some people pay more attention to it while some less but ! To whatever degree of discomfort it causing it is simply unacceptable to have neither in portrait nor in landscape orientation. I only paid attention to it on my 3d day of use but now i can see it every time and it is simply disturbing and infuriating to have on the new 500$ device. Huge letdown from Apple who with their usual arrogance will not acknowledge it neither will issue recall or even care to redesign it. They already said that it is normal behavior !!! Ha! Simply bad engineering decision by putting screen controller on the wrong side of the screen making it good for landscape use only! Looks like Cupertino have some serious brain drain there. Worst of all no alternative. Returned. Take a look at pic attached so you can see screen proportions of GalaxyS2 vs Mini6

  I've used several ipads before deciding to buy one myself. When the iPad Air 4 released it was perfect for me, no front home button, fingerprint sensor, type-c connection (like all my other devices) and colour options. I bought it with the Apple Pencil 2 and I use it for artwork in Procreate, the lack of bluetooth transferring capability is probably the most disappointing thing but it's not a dealbreaker. The screen is amazing and palm rejection works very well. The handwriting tool is very accurate and I love writing on the screen (as slippery as it is sometimes). I use iMessage on it to talk to my sister on her iPhone and I can use Facetime which I wasn't sure about prior to purchase. It really is a great device and the size is perfect for drawing and watching shows.

  Looking for the hardest way to do anything? I love my iphone 11, so I assumed ipad air would be as easy and fun to use. Boy was I wrong! Set up is tedious, support articles are not helpful, and Siri is unhelpful, often not even responding to questions. There are distracting pop up tips that don’t apply to what you’re doing, claims it can do things it can’t, and no common sense with the AI. I regret this purchase.

  Upon unboxing device from appropriately sealed ‘Apple’ box and proceeding with set-up, device needed ‘passcode’ for use.,We have no wifi, 3 hrs from nearest Apple store. I assume there is a restocking fee—as is the case with these electronic devices.,Unhappy customer.,Edit: I had contacted the seller, and they immediately responded, indicating I could return the device and reorder. In the meantime, I was able to unlock the ipad after 6 hours of simultaneous downloads at our local library, using their public wifi, then another hour or so working on it from home. We have Verizon, so our internet & cellular svc is extremely weak. (Verizon seems to orient their focus toward city centers).

  I purchased the rose gold one love the color beautiful design this is my first tablet ever so for it to be an iPad that was very nice works perfectly and honestly this is the perfect amount of storage for me no complaints
"
Robloo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I viewed this model as underperforming but that's because I based my observations on previous iPad Pro purchases. This is not an iPad Pro. There were features mentioned such as connecting portable drives that did not work to my expectations based on functionality promises.  Maxing storage at 256GB was a big turnoff, too.  I'm looking forward to the new iPad Pro 12.9 with up to 2TB storage and I should be happy.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very disappointing. Brand new ipad and it won't take a charge. Needed repairs in the first 90 days. Window for return is 60 days. I ordered new charging cables which I thought would. It didn't. Needed a new charging port in a brand new ipad.
"
CheriVee Dee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had an ongoing debate with myself for the past few months about purchasing this iPad and if the purchase should be made at Amazon or via the Apple website.,I decided to go with Amazon because of the tax that the Apple website hits you with. Of course there was some trepidation after reading some reviews where some folks’ devices weren’t working. Nevertheless, I purchased.,Man am I glad I did! It’s a brand new device and I have no issues. Total score! I am very pleased with my purchase. I definitely recommend Amazon’s Apple Store.
"
Juke Worx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing tablet. Hard to believe tablets have but a relatively short existence. This does everything. I would have loved to have this when I was in college or the military. Biggest drawback I can see is that of all the features and conveniences offered, there is no way to find a Apple Pencil. Seriously. First conclusion is so you buy another pencil. But what if you buy a cheaper second pencil from someone else. This tablet is lightweight, has the new USB C charging connector and one day apple will get rid of that too and charge everything wirelessly. Maybe even use the screen as a solar collector. Innovation is coming.
"
JCO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was a little skeptical about buying an iPad on Amazon because the price was lower than at Apple store - not sure how Amazon does that, but I like it. Product was new, wrapped in genuine Apple packaging and works as expected. Don't think I really need to leave a review for the iPad itself, as the product pretty much speaks for itself.
"
Hannah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I used a knockoff Paperlike screen protector, as well as a knockoff Apple Pencil and off brand keyboard. They work and connect perfectly to this iPad. I’ll admit I shopped around for a while before buying this, but I’m glad I finally got it! I mainly got this for schoolwork (I use GoodNotes) and it majorly updated my LIFE. Battery life is great, I’ve had 0 issues with this device. If you’re considering it, just get it! To write easier, get a screen protector that’s similar to paper. Now it’s super easy to annotate lecture notes and I love how I’m not wasting paper. I use this for EVERYTHING now.

Red,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had a 2 year old slightly above base level iPad and got this a year after MBP…,Positives:,-It’s snappy,-Pixel density is nice,Negs:,-Contrast ratio for $800 is utter garbage… this is all screen and the screen is as bad as the cheap old iPad I had, no one is sitting with two iPads 24/7 comparing a 10% improvement, I got the other one because it was cheap and it fit the bill… this is MacBook priced and gets beat by budget tablets,-it’s nice that the CPU is decent but iPadOS is trash, like a decade ago, it’s an iPhone with big screen but what’s it for then? I can’t take it anywhere that the MBP won’t go… there are no “real” apps in the store so outside of pencil apps the iPhone and MBP win in portability or function… I’m writing this on the iPad and it’s a chore… half the screen is covered up by the keys and I constantly have to balance the thing since it skids and topples at uneven pressure…,-Face ID is as dumb as on the iPhone, there it’s masks here you have to constantly move covers and cups so that the sensor is in your face and half the time you have to lift the thing to aim it…,-camera bump… whose this for? Whose going around with an 11” device and taking photos… I only see 2-3 weirdos a year in YT videos that are being laughed at in the video… now how many people put their device flat on the table?,-browser, this is meant as a consumption device… doesn’t work, ads ads everywhere, pay $800 to not be able to Adblock anything because you’re using phone browsers from 2005

"
Elijah London,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Originally I thought these were fake, but no THEY ARE REAL. Now, don't get these confused with the pros. These are the 3rd Gen. Meaning, there IS NOT NOISE CANCELLATION. In my personal opinion, They are the exact same just that these do not have noise cancellation which is still fine by me. All in all, great quality product. Pros are just a little bit better, but if you want to save some money then go with these. Everything is pretty much the exact same.
"
Ashlie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Honkai,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They sound great and the features are a step up from the Gen 2 AirPods except for comfort. I found myself having to readjust them often and if I’m gonna do that I might as well use the Pros because they have ANC.

"
Timasia Hendrick ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was excited for this new release. These have great sound quality but they continuously fell out of my ear even while doing the simplest tasks. The 2nd generation worked great for me over the last year; when generation 3 was made they changed the style of the ear piece. Recommend anyone to try because all of our ears are shaped different.!,I ended up purchasing the pros which have adjustable tips.
"
Scott,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great device with a terrible screen issue (possibly, just for now). The left portion (in portrait) of the screen refreshes at a slower rate than the right, causing content to distort when animating, or most notably, when scrolling. This is currently present on all units (I confirmed by going to the Apple store and all 5 units I inspected had the issue as well) - Once you see it your can't unsee it. I find the iTunes store app to give a great demonstration of how bad it can be, with all of the small square content pieces distorting into obvious skewed angles and trapezoids. Hopefully Apple can fix the issue with a graphics driver update, but theres still a chance it's caused by a hardware configuration issue. I've been waiting for this form factor for a long time, so this is a major disappointment. The device is great otherwise, as advertised, but this screen distortion gives me a headache and I'll likely return the tablet if Apple doesn't find a fix. It ruins it.

Chris H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My first apple product and the build quality is top notch, very premium feel. I couldn’t justify paying the extra money for a iPad Pro when the air 4 has everything most people need. I use my ipad for drawing and typical web surfacing, Netflix, etc and its very snappy with a great screen. The speakers could be better like the pro but it’s definitely acceptable. The thin bezels are a perfect size. The fingerprint scanner location is not the best but again not a deal breaker. No regrets going with the air 4 over the pro. I used the extra money for the magic kB and pencil.
"
SAC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have owned two other IPADs in the past.  This is nice with a larger screen however there are some differences in this model from the previous models in where things are located and how it operates.  The one problem I had initially was how to turn the thing off.  I don't like the way it turns off.  You can go into setting and shutdown or hold the power with volume button to get the power off screen.  I don't really like that.
"
Shellee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been using for almost a month. I received it within two weeks of my order, which is earlier than expected. At first I was skeptical because they were cheaper than Apple website itself. When it arrived, I could defend that it came from apple because of its packaging.,There were some rough edges, that looked like it was dropped, which worried me. When I opened it, it worked fine and as I mention I have been using it for a month. Overall would give it a 5/5.
"
naren,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great product for great price. Screen quality and design is really good. It’s really refreshing and new to use iPad Air and I love that experience. Battery life is pretty good for my use. Picture quality is outstanding. The only downsides for this price point is not having a 120 Hz refresh rate screen. That’s the major downside. Apart from that, I really like using the product on a daily basis.
"

  Wanted to watch Netflix while husband watches golf. This suited my needs and was insanely easy to set up and sync to my phone. Just turn it on next to your iPhone and everything loads. I also like to cook and recipes are so much easier to read on the big screen. Didn’t know what I was missing trying to read recipes off my tiny phone! Very happy with this for my simple recreational needs.
"
Chinnnie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s everything they said it is. I moved up from my iPad Air 2 64GB and haven’t looked back.,The improvements over the Air2  are subtle but substantial. Touch ID makes you realize how often you had to manually key in your ID.,The price point is a bit steep vs  what I paid for the Air2 but you do get what you paid for. The build quality is what you would expect from Apple.,Everything is responsive; I don’t detect any lag. It’s as if I added bandwidth to our WiFi.,Now I need to decide if this is worthy of a keyboard as a simple laptop replacement for quick getaways.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Upgraded from my 2017 iPad pro to this ipad air, the pro was still getting the job done but coming close to the end of updates I and wanting the newer design I pulled the trigger sold my pro for 500 so had to do it , editing is awesome on this ipad, media consumption even with only two speakers vs the 4 on the pro still nice and loud the second gen apple pencil is a must I purchased the 256gb model wish there was a higher storage one but this will do been editing travel videos and pictures on this ipad and works amazing super fast and smooth just enjoying it very much
"
Manuel Diva,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the iPad gen 2 but we never really used it at home. It languished and was never replaced just because it was much easier to use our phones while on the couch vs the ipad. With the addition of the apple pencil support, I decided to purchase this for my husband and I, as we're both artists and could use it. My husband uses it constantly and has already completed multiple drawings on it.,We don't use it for much anything else but to draw on but that's exactly why we bought it. We didn't really need another multi-purpose device but as a drawing tablet that can double for other things in a pinch this was a great buy for us.
"
Iepoch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am glad I decided on this ipad. Using it is like the iPad pro I don't mind the inch difference and since I use a headset speakers are not an issue for me. It is exactly what fills my need. And paired with the apple keyboard it allows me freedom to type anywhere I need too. The apple pencil this time around is way better than the first apple pencil. I love scribble and I find myself using it a lot.
"
Mark J. Geldon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my second IPad Air. The first one still works great; but, it is getting a little long in the tooth. So I decided to get the IPad 4 just in case. The IPad Air 4 is just a little faster then my IPaid Air 2.  I have had nothing but great luck with all my Apple products. Even my refurbished ITouch works great. Yes the Apple products are more expensive; but, I don’t mind paying for excellent performance and durability. That is one thing that my HP’s and Dell’s that I have had in the past can claim.

   I did reach out to Amazon and my iPad was swapped out with a brand new IPad that works perfectly! Thanks to Amazon and their quick response and keeping a long time customer happy!,As soon as I turned on the ipad I could see a damaged spot. When I touch the front and back of the ipad the spot gets worse. I bought this for a great price and of course it was too good to be true. Although the spot is small, I'm just not willing to keep a defective product after purchasing ""brand new"".
"
Kevin J. Bowman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have wanted a new iPad for years as I usually buy the standard iPad models because I am cheap.  But this time I decided to get the better model and for whatever reason but Amazon was selling them considerably cheaper than Apple, so I decided to buy it.  I was not disappointed and could instantly see the higher quality screen, faster processor and extra features with USB-C.  Gotta love that!!  This unit charges super fast with my high wattage USB-C chargers.  Now my folks and siblings have all ordered them too.  I am sure the Air 5 will be better but I will have no reason to upgrade further for quite a few generations.  If you can find a goo deal on it, then buy it.
"
Natasha Hawke,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My wife loved it. I got it for her as an anniversary present and she was not expecting it at all. I had her set it up herself, because she is a little intimidated by technology so I went to the store and said “see what you can do”, and by the time I got back she was on Facebook and all her apps were up and running. Amazing product. Amazing set up. Amazing presentation.

"
Ty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I used to have iPad Air 3rd gen but because I do digital arts and use the apple pencil a lot, I decided to upgrade my iPad just to use the second gen of Apple pencil.,Some people would think that would be a stupid reason to upgrade an iPad but it's worth it!,When you use the apple pencil 1st generation, the battery runs out so quickly and you have to charge it in that stupid way if you know what I'm talking about. Also as someone who draws a lot on the iPad, the tapping feature is just a very useful and luxurious thing to have.,Now iPad itself, it's just amazing. Literally no cons. I got 256 GB and the storage is more than enough for me so far, and the responsiveness of this tablet is just spectacular. Especially if you use Goodnotes hyperlinks, you can definitely tell how responsive the new biochip is.
"
Sue Lindstrom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It is amazing!!! My granddaughter uses it for school and drawing. It is very nice, but my only complaint is that when she sunk it with her phone, it didn’t install any of her apps. But overall worth the money because at other places, the same IPad is $800. We spent $550-600 including the iPad, case, a cheap pen that works great and screensavers. Very nice.
"
Marti Silent,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought this solely for the purpose of being able to do digital art on the go. I only have an at-home station and kept catching myself out of the house a lot more lately and doing a lot less art. Now I pull this out in waiting rooms, at friend's houses while hanging out and vibing, and now with a new job on top of my schedule, I've got drawing time during my lunch breaks lol. It's also come in handy for writing more, which I didn't expect. Buying a keyboard along with your iPad pays off a lot if you like to do some writing!,Basically, I love it a lot. :D
"
SAM I AM,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very poor battery life. Did I get a refurbished pad vs the new one I paid for? The charging cord is so short one can’t use the ipad while it is charging. Couldn’t Apple spring for a longer cord and design one that is easy to plug in and lasts for more than a couple of months on a $700 machine? Location of fingerprint recognition pad is awkward.
"

I imagine that's why with the Pro version the added the rubber parts to them so they hold in the ear better. I would stick with Gen 2 or try the Pro before getting the Gen 3.

FAQ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound quality is great and even the noise cancellation works well. However, they don’t fit well in my ears and fall out for the slightest reason. Unfortunately you cannot adjust them to fit. I would recommend trying them on before you buy, if you can.
"
Slasher,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Has been working great. One earbud survied a trip through the washer. But the fit is not great. One fits better than the other. Past generation was better fit.

John,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods were still attached to previous owner’s iCloud account which allows them to track me, see my home location, as well as disable them or restrict access. Completely useless and Amazon just wants me to return them so they can sell them to someone else! Super sketchy and major safety breach. Beware when purchasing these refurbished headphones
"
Gabriela Z Lopez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  In comparison with the first generation. This one feels big on the ears and doesn’t stay out as the first ones. Still! Sound is great, easy to manage calls. I like them!!
"
Drew sanderson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Does not fit every ear size. I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas and they are WAY too big for her ears. They don’t fit at all. She has very average size ears so I didn’t think this would happen and she had the old ones and those worked great, fit perfect and everything. A huge bummer, the old ones are better except for the battery life anyway, so save yourself some money and the risk of them not fitting and don’t buy these please.

Joseph Gonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have all the apple pods. Gen 1&2 we’re great. I couldn’t get with the pros because they hurt so bad and returned them the same week. These gen 3s are perfect. They don’t hurt at all, they sound good and they’re very nice looking. Worth the buy for sure!!!
"

  I like Apple earphones. The sound quality of these earphones has been greatly improved compared to the previous generation, but be careful, you have to pay attention to where your earphones are made. There will be noises made in Vietnam.

"
Viviana,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Me gusta la calidad del sonido, lo que no me agrada es que no se sujeta bien al oído, luego de unos 15 minutos de uso siento que se desajusta. Además si eres de los que escucha música y en el transporte preferible elegir los AirPods Pro porque los AirPods 3 no tienen cancelación de ruido y se opaca mucho la música con el ruido exterior y es molesto.

  I have been using these for a while and honestly I love them. I can find them anywhere they are when I lose them, most nights I fall asleep listening to these things and in the morning they are still alive (battery still has juice) and not like 10% or anything, they had like 40% this morning when I woke up. I really love these, they last for hours and they’re just so awesome.

  Just got an Apple Watch, still getting use to it. The 41 size is perfect for me, got the GPS only style and so far no issues. I put my watch on the charger each morning while in the shower and it charges just fine during that time - not sure why so many complaints about battery life. No issues with sync up to phone, very easy and quick. Miss a few features that my fitbit watch had but still hopeful the Apple Watch will work in those areas.

chris lesko,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I paid a lot of money for this watch. It was packaged very nicely but it does not come with a charging cube to insert into the outlet. I have an Apple watch and cubes and none would work. So, I figured I must need a special cube just for an Apple watch.  Bought one for $24 on Amazon and it doesn't work either. So now I have spent additional money. My son-in-law came over and thought it could be charged on my computer but it could not. So, he has now ordered me another type of cube from Best Buy and hope this works. Have had this watch for almost 1 month and have yet to be able to charge it. Not happy

"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  All I can say it's really disappointing to buy and item like this and you can't use it because there is no way to charge it. Now imagine getting it as a gift and having to wait to use it until you buy another item (the power block) to charge it. That's like buying a TV without a power cord, or a new car that doesn't come with the FOB or key. I never liked Apple products because of the hassle, this just solidifies my belief that APPLE SUCKS.

  This Watch does it all. Use it to keep track of my daily schedule with out me having to constantly pay attention to setting up alarms. It’s long battery life keeps it on my arm and not charging. Once again you get what you pay for ,in this case the best.
"
Dwight,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality and battery life is great. However the fit of the earbuds while in are not. Not only do they not fit in your ear they constantly slip out causing the sound level to go down. They spatial audio is nothing crazy, to me the sound better while fixed, not adjusting based on your head. Personally, will be returning because for me the cons outweigh the pros. Overall could be better.
"
Andie Caster,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this item for Black Friday and I’m honestly pretty disappointed. The earbud that goes in the left ear fits okay, but the one for my right ear does not fit nicely and feels very loose. I’m nervous it is going to fall out. I have to readjust it every minute, but still can’t figure out how to make it fit comfortably. The regular apple earphones with the wire fits better than these. Returning this product.

  I bought these on sale for $139.99 and got the AppleCare+ “Just in case” the sound quality is very good and fits nicely in ear. Battery life is great and charges fast. Hopefully these last me for many years. If noise cancelation is a must or preferred get the pros. I’m content with these so far.

Ronald Jensen,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great sound, but I don't like the design as well as my 2nd generation airpods, which would no longer hold a charge after about 4 years of use.  Compared to 2nd generation, the 3rd generation does not fit into the ear as well (easily falls out of my ears), does not fit into the case as well, and has a larger case.  It's unfortunate to have a worse design for a supposed product upgrade.

"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This ipad is light and fast.  But I am frustrated by the fact that it is missing a few key functions that I enjoyed on the ipad that I purchased in 2012.,The USB-C connector is only useful for charging.  It doesn't allow me to connect a flash drive with USB-C to look at movies, photos, documents.  I could do that on my older ipad.  Now I can't download movies onto my flash drive and watch them on an airplane anymore.,  There is no standard headphone connection.  I assume that Apple did this so that they can sell their expensive airbuds.  However,  I was able to purchase a $7 adapter on Amazon so that I can use cheap airbuds with this ipad.
"
TJP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It was glitchy from the get-go, freezing occasionally, but was always able to restart.  Six months after purchase, the screen froze and was unable to turn off or log on. Have to mail it back with a one week repair turn around. Apple won’t let me swap it out at a nearby Best Buy, but expects in-person swap at nearest Apple store - over an hour away. Buy an android instead.
"
Gab,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had this iPad for over 7 months now. I haven’t had any issues except that it came with what I suspect is water damage on the upper right corner. It was the first thing I saw when I unboxed it! It is not very noticeable though, it only shows on certain angles or background colors like white, most of the times I forget about it. Still, makes me scared that someday it will spread or maybe make internal damages on the iPad ….
"
cindyjobhunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I use this when I go to bed and want to catch up on stuff that is not covered by the news. I am not into games. I love that I got free Apple Tv for a year. I have watched several programs already.,I buy iPad because I can get data on it through a phone company so when I go on vacations, I can still read my emails without using ""free"" wi-fi. It costs more, but I feel more confident using my own data than signing up to a motel wi-fi. To me, that is extremely important.
"
Wendell S. Read,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I use the iPads almost entirely for reading - books, articles, etc.  Because of major damage to both shoulders, I find the iPad Pro inconvenient and sometimes painful to hold, lift and move around. This Air version is significantly more comfortable, not to mention cheaper than a new Pro, and the somewhat smaller screen is a somewhat small price to pay (I'll admit to continuing to depend on the Pro for jigsaw puzzles, where every little bit of space counts).,Main downside is the faintness of the ""upper case"" numerals & characters on the keyboard.  Makes the concept practically useless.
"
martha rubi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Moe K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I haven't used apple products in a long time but I kept seeing other artists using the iPad air 4 and procreate so I decided to go ahead and get one. When I turned it on it was already at 95% and it took about two days to get down to 20% after on and off working/downloading stuff. Overall I do not regret it, the camera quality is pretty good, the screen size is great for what I plan to use it for, and I can use my type c 10ft charger for my phone instead of the extremely short one that came with it.
"
Argis,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Can only be set up for a single user and it effectively augments the screen on your phone.  Larger display than a phone.  Beautiful photos (Just like the phone).  The larger display and optional external keyboard are the only two things this provides over your iPhone that I can see.
"
RS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Its a great device sure. There is not much to say about the product as it is already well known. Just 2 points;,(1) Finger print scanner mounted on the sides is a pain,(2) Battery performance is very very poor compared with other apple devices (including my earlier i-pad) that I have used before,Late Note: Amazon is fast becoming a platform for sellers pushing ""fakeware/defective / refreshed and sold as new"".,Off late, I have stopped buying Branded stuff from Amazon no matter how tempting the offer/price,additional note: shutting down all apps and functions that might drain battery resulting in tiny, hardly noticeable difference. Downgrading the review to 1
"
Al,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The power button does not turn off the iPad Air, instead you have to press it along with the volume down or volume up button for the slider to show up. And it doesn't turn back on right after you turn it off. You have to wait for it to be off for at least 30 second to press the power button for the device to turn on.,This is a new behavior I've seldom seen in previous iPads and iPhones I've had. But other than that it works as it should. I don't like the face id so I taped over the cameras.
"
Kenneth Nicely,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  You would think with pay ing $200 for a pair of earbuds you would have amazing sound quality. Upon using them for the first time there was crackling only in the right earbud almost like the earbud was already blown and used. I do not think that that was the case because it was still sealed in the packaging unless they resealed it and saw them as being used which I would not put past Apple doing. Amazon was amazing with the return even though it was extremely frustrating trying to get it all figured out.
"
William,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Got one from BB before this, i returned it and bought this from amazon because of the price difference. I loved the spatial music and superb noise cancellation. Perfect fit with the right rubber tips. It updates itself to the latest firmware. Checked the serial number from apple and it is legit NOT FAKE.,Only complain is it easily catches dirt. It has a gap makes this airpod catch dirts, its not proper aligned or glued smoothly, found some extra rubber silicone between gaps.
"
L. Busch,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They fall out of my ears. The sound is meh. Sure, Apple owns the ecosystem and the custom chip helps with pairing. But they keep trying to connect to another of my Apple devices, so this 'feature' is also often an annoyance. Battery life is not great. Mic quality is also meh. There are no mics in the stem ends, so I don't understand why the stems exist here. My ear canals block the actual mic hole, so people can't hear me well. You can't let your ears near anything or the stems will catch and they'll jump out to the ground.,The case is good, and they are easy to remove and replace relative to some other brands. But that hardly makes up for their desire to commit suicide by jumping out of your ears.,I'm returning them.
"
Tom B,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Make sure you get the right fit and seal with eartips otherwise they will be either uncomfortable and/or lack seal and loose sound quality in particular bass response.,I was on fence between newer airpods 3 and airpods pro gen1, leaning more toward former for a better low-frequency response until I switched from medium to large tips and started to sound almost similar.
"
Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Just as expected! Great sound quality! Fits snuggly in the ear and doesn’t fall out like other ear buds. I don’t know why people said there is no power cable. Maybe they didn’t take the top piece out of the box, but there is a power cable included in the box. There is no need to buy an additional cable. Included a picture to show where the cable is.
"
LaJuan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Mine are from Vietnam. I read all the new ones are from there now. I checked the serial number on the box, MagSafe case, and in my settings. It’s the same for all three. No issues so far. Sound quality is great. I didn’t know the noise cancellation is was this great. I have to really yell load to hear myself. The transparency mode is awesome as well. Great buy for Black Friday. Can’t beat that price, was cheaper than the AirPod 3. Package was sealed and not damaged at all. No scam over here. I felt weird having an IPhone 13 Pro Max and still using wired ear buds. I cut the cord baby.,Oh yeah for those saying no adaptor box with it. Well I got an IPhone 13 Pro max and it didn’t come with an adaptor box neither. The adaptor wouldn’t fit inside this box with the AirPods anyway. T tells you what’s included in the box prior to purchase if you read.,Great Buy.
"
Robert,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I wear these on the plane when I travel (weekly). They don’t fit my ear all that well, they fall out of my ear easily, they have a horrible battery life and you can barely hear music in them over the roar of a plane engine. I’m yet to find an ear bud that works 1/100th as well as a pair of Bose over-the-ear unit. Overall, don’t buy into the hype on this Apple product. They do phones amazingly well, but their other ‘support’ products aren’t worth their price!
"
Casper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I needed buds that were noise cancelling and Bose earbuds are seriously not it. I don't get why people like those.,These are great! I can barely hear any snoring, and can definitely not hear the sounds of transportation. It's good for my sensory overload issue.,Only complaint is that when I play a video or music or anything, one of the earbuds is a bit delayed in playing the audio. It fixes itself after a second and you kinda get used to it, but what the heck? lol. Also the battery life is BAD. It definitely doesn't last a full night of sleep, even with full charge. If you can get past both of those things, you're all set.,...The noise cancellation seriously trumps those issues though.
"
Tom Hockman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple Air Pods Pro claim to have better sound quality and noise canceling ability, but as a middle aged man I couldn’t tell much difference in sound from regular Air Pods. The real downer for me was fit in my tiny ears was poor. You have to jam the padding into your ear canal to enable noise cancelation and that can be uncomfortable or Ill-fitting for small ear sizes. They are good headphones but I wouldn’t buy them again based on value for the price.
"
khershner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are great earbuds. I contemplated buying another non-Apple brand based on a friend’s review, but I’m glad that I decided on the pricier AirPod pros. Once you connect them through the Bluetooth you never have to turn them on again they just automatically come on when you put them in your ears and the directional sound feature is very cool and doesn’t distract you. It’s sort of invisible but makes a big difference in sound quality. Oh, and the other day I just discovered their noise canceling benefits… It was so subtle I didn’t realize it at first but I was on a noisy street and as soon as I took them one out to talk to someone it was like a blast of noise. These are the best Apple product I’ve had for a long time.
"
Caleb ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really really want to love these airpods. The spatial audio is awesome and the sound quality is superb. The shape and fit is so weird, though. They kind of sit on the outside of your ears but they are so loose that they always feel like they are about to fall out. Whenever I smile or move my face at all, I have to re-adjust them. If you can get over the fit than I say go for it, but unfortunately I have to return them.

  I had the AirPods 2 and upgraded to these mostly since I wanted wireless charging anyway. But I am BLOWN AWAY by the additional spatial sounds in these.

Dom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They have a little more punch than the 2nd Gen but not a whole lot. A great mix between the pros and normal AirPods. Give you the pros function ( minus the noise cancellation) for a lower price. I like the fact that they don't have the silicone tips like the pros as well.
"

"
Cam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  People have been rating these AirPods with low starts because of the size of them, they are a little big but it all depends on your ear size. People complain about how they fall out but they just have tiny ear holes., If you’re not sure whether to get these I’ve the pros, go to an apple store and ask to test out the fit of both models of AirPods. Over all these are really great, it was worth my money

  I have been wanting to get a new iPad for a while now. I decided to get this one because it seemed like a good in between of a normal iPad and a pro. I used this iPad for almost 8 hours on day and was only down 50% battery. It works extremely well with an Apple Pencil for digital art. The fingerprint recognition is flawless, and it having no home button is not as annoying as I was worried it would be. Overall just as good as I expected, if not better
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After owning several other brands of pads when it was time for an upgrade I decided to buy an ipad. This was my first Apple product and I'm impressed. Screen is bright and crystal clear, touch functions are great, nice video and audio (for a small pad) and I like being able, with the pencil, to actually use it like a standard paper pad. For my uses the battery life is very good. A solid pad for use with a variety of applications. A good buy, especially with the discount from Amazon.
"
Beldin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the color of this iPad. I have used iOS devices for years now, so this is just another iOS device. The specs have been updates and the performance is what I would expect from Apple. My only issue is the touchscreen seems less responsive then I'm used too on my iOS phone and tablets. It uses the new C type charger so now I need 2 types of cables to charge my Apples. Overall I am content with the purchase.
"

  No complaints at all. The size of the screen is what I wanted. I’m able to use the ‘pencil’ t write, draw, play games, etc with no issues. The battery life is pretty good. I’ve been using this iPad more and more for work so I have no complaints about that.

  A die hard Apple fan will love these as the sound quality is a big improvement over previous generations. They are noise cancelling but to a mild degree. To make them noise cancelling they must now use silicon tips that come in three sizes so you really need to try them all to get a good fit and best noise canceling. I was not completely satisfied as these tend to fall out of my ears where the last generation never did.  I purchased some memory foam tips and they work better but still not like the old generation pods. The shafts are also shorter and they are harder to remove from the charging case than the old ones, especially if you have big fingers. I think Apple let us down on this upgrade.

  They work as they are supposed to. There are plenty of reviews on this model of Apple AirPods Pro. Many were done by professional or serious music listeners. I would recommend people to do the online research and read the reviews before deciding if to buy them. For my purpose, the pairs work very well, easy to sync with my iPhone, easy to operate. The noise cancellation works very well and is easy to turn on and off. I got the pairs at discounted price during holiday sale. No complaint.

Carlos Lantigua,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was reluctant to purchase these because I assumed it was all hype and that the quality couldn’t be that great on ear buds. I was specially skeptical about the noice cancellation. I was very wrong as these are worth the price tag. They sync up amazingly with your apple devices and as soon as I enabled noice cancellation I could bare hear anything around me. The feeling of it canceling the noice was so amazing to me. The audio is also fantastic and syncing was very easy to do. I dropped one pretty hard the other day as it slipped off of my ear and it didn’t break which was a huge relief. Other than wishing these didn’t cost so much, I can’t say a single bad thing about them as they have exceeded my expectations.

Lara,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These sound good, but not better than my cheap ones. They always feel like they are falling out, I’ve tried all the different inserts, and sometimes they do fall out. Also when I push on them to stop them from falling out, there is a loud ringing/squeak. The sound glitches, I’ve used them 4 times and this happens every time. Not being able to change the volume is so annoying. I work 12 hours a day so the 4 hour batteries suck. My old ones never fall out, last 14 hours, Noise canceling(just not at good) and were like $25.

Roxann Patzman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have an android phone. I bought them because they can be used as hearing amplifiers. The only drawback to that is that the phone has to be in the same room at all times. Because the sound comes from the phone and feeds into the airpods. Next phone will be an iphone.,The sound quality is awesome. The fit is awesome. They don't fall out of my ear like the other 2 pairs of cheap buds I bought kept doing. I'm not constantly fussing with them. They stay put. Luckily I got them on sale but they're still worth every penny. I'm going to convince the hubs to get a pair for his phone. He's an Uber driver and it would be great for him to hear both his phone and passenger.

"
Cynthia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these to replace my old AirPods because they would no longer hold a charge. They are nice but I am not overly impressed. Just an upgrade from my basic ones. I think the noise cancelling claim is overblown. How much noise can an earbud cancel anyway. I think you need headphones that cover your ears for that to really work. I got these on sale. I definitely would not recommend paying Apple’s full price for them, not worth that. But I’m still happy with them.
"
Pete,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No Q&A Apple? One day old, One battery dies before the other, feedback when moving in ear while listening sounds like hearing aid my grandmother used to wear, one earbud not assembled properly the edges are not flush, what sucks I want to give another set a chance, so I asked to replace them here at Amazon and I have to wait over a month to get them, plain BS really, and is the reason why I will never buy any Apple product ever after this, and I will also trim down my Amazon purchase's also, it would have been better to buy at Bestbuy, then I can walk them right into the store for a return if defective.
"
Joseph A. Bergeron,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Why did I wait so long? I had the first set that came out, but I needed extra pieces to help hold in my ears.,They would fall out often. These new ones with extras for fit test was the difference maker. The settings are perfect for the I Pod Pros. The clarity and sound are incredible.

  I'm an Apple product user and was anxious to get this iPad as I do almost everything throughout my day as well as most all my projects on my portable devices. The screen quality is good the battery life is fantastic. The picture quality is good. It's a bit more heavy than I thought, but otherwise it's been an easy to set up and streamline all of my projects and data from my previous device.

  I’m neither exclusive to Apple or Android. I just appreciate a very well made product. My last tablet was an android; “Samsung Tab s2”. Unfortunately, it only lasted a little over a year, I’m sad to say. On the contrary, I purchased my wife a 3rd generation iPad, which lasted nearly 8 years....This tablet has a beautiful feel, color and quality. It’s very capable of doing far more than what I’ll ever need it for. And for a very fair price, I feel. I am also certain that it will last me much longer than a year. Extremely happy with my purchase!

  El iPad Air 4th gen es un excelente dispositivo, tiene todo lo que necesitas para que se convierta en tu herramienta de trabajo o estudio, la compatibilidad con el Magic keyboard y el Pencil 2nd generación lo hace el iPad perfecto, lo uso personalmente con el Magic keyboard y su autonomía es muy buena. El usb tipo c permite gestionar archivos, es delgado y muy liviano. Estoy muy feliz con el.

  I believe my iPad  was not new and refurbished/used. It has been unable to correctly operated and I have had to multiple times reboot to operate to just go get 1/2 of operating.,And  now the battery runs 1/2 day when in use.,(A new replacement iPad would be great a gesture since the large price and expense and I am i’am purchasing site unseen). I am not saying I don’t trust but a mist been harmless been,made (. I am sure of it.),A replacement with new iPad would be a great compromise.,Thank you very much and kindest regards.

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  love these however the fit is really bad. The only way they stay in is to wear a beanie,neck tube,or balaclava that covers your ears. After 4 plus hrs with them in it feels like someone punched you in the ear. The upgrades from previous models make it worth it though

Hollister Tidwell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This item was like new, a return Amazon tested and repacked.  I saved close to $150 - absolutely no regrets on purchasing used.  No regrets on the item either, it's got almost as much power as the much more expensive ipad pro, and I haven't come across a feature reduction that made much difference to me  Long battery life. gorgeous screen.  I pick it up thought the day to check price and availability of things I need, breaking news that needs confirmation, purchasing, research and reference.  Sure. I could do most of that on my phone. But this has the same portability and improved quality and esse of use w/ the larger, easy to read screen and typing is easier w/ the larger format.  I love it

  I absolutely love this tablet! It is so responsive and works so well. I’m very impressed. It has all the features I need plus many more I am still learning to use. The ability to use the Apple Pencil 2 is why I chose this tablet and I’m glad I did. It works great! The battery on the tablet lasts a long time, even when using an art app for long periods of time. I’ve started using this more than my desktop computer.

  I am just moving back to apple after using Samsung/android for several years and I'm already in love with my new iPad and iPhone.  I would not say that apple is better than Samsung, but I do like the integration between devices and since all my family and friends are apple, I got back on board!  This iPad air is quit a bit bigger and heavier than our old iPad air 2 but it is a great product and iOS 14.4 adds a lot over previous versions.

cc,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had an old ipad air from 2013, and it was time to finally replace since the screen wasn't as responsive. I use this for pretty basic functions--mostly for notability, and the screen is very responsive despite using a glass screen protector. I just use my finger to write (been doing this for years), so haven't invested in the pencil yet and don't really see a need to at this point. Would def buy again.

Tandroneka Robicheaux,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought the second generation AirPods at first but ended up losing one. Instead of getting the same pair, I opted for these instead. BEST DECISION EVER! When I tell you the audio quality alone is so much better than the second gen’s, I mean it far exceeds the limit. Along with the spacial audio, these will be the best choice. I like it better also because I hate the buds on the pros and these fit better 😂
"
K. McKown,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
KB Wan Kenobi,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They are mediocre at best. Why does everyone rave about these? Sat at my desk 3 days in a row with them in ears, no music playing or anything, took maybe 2-3 normal calls and all 3 days battery lasted from 9am til about 1-2 pm, that’s it. My Bose lasts for 3 days or more without a charge. Sound is good but if you only need them a few hours a day I guess these would work for you- not me.,Why do people love these? My ears hurt!
"
Kevin H.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not happy at all with them. Quality is not on par with typical Apple products and I think Bose is way better. Initially they would not connect and stay connected to my phone. The right ear bud kept making a buzzing sound and continues to do that every time I try to use them. Almost like it’s cycling or something. The noise cancellation is pretty good but I just can’t get past how glitchy these seem. I’ll stick with Bose products.
"
Momof5!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So Apple owns my life, if I wanted to get out I probably wouldn’t be able to. I love how easily Apple integrates itself into itself. No figuring how to set something or trying to get it to work. This is my third set of iPods all still going strong despite being washed in the washer multiple times or being dropped billions of times. True they will gross you out with the grime and gunk and ear wax long before they ever stop working.
"
aultraman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I liked the noise cancellation and the sound quality. These are also comfortable to wear.,But I'm on the Android world, and having to adjust the volume using my phone instead of these earbuds is too crazy.  I also couldn't figure out how to charge these with the lighting-to-USB C cable.,I'm sure I can find something similar without the volume adjustment issue; and also easy to charge for under S100.
"
Jaime Watson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am so disapointed to have to return this product! When I first put the set in I noticed the left one had a little static that went away. I listened to them for I'd say two hours with no problems at all. Then the left completely stopped working the next day! It says in the bluetooth settings that the left doesn't have a good connection to my ear and to try a different tip - I've tried them all 5 times and reset them 10 times. I have forgot device and reconnected 20+ times as I needed these on a road trip for a meeting and they didn't work due to the left not having a good fit in my ear!! I don't understand why this fitting feature can't be turned off?? After searching online it appears there are countless complaints of this exact issue! Apple should stop selling these with this known problem. I have called in to Apple, messaged with their support, updated the software, nothing worked. Returning for a different brand of bluetooth ear buds.

Joel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These headphones are incredible! From the spatial audio and noise cancellation features to the fit, feel, and ease of setup, the AirPods Pro earbuds exemplify the Apple aesthetic and user experience at every turn. The preinstalled tips fit my ears out of the box, and setup was literally as simple as unlocking my phone and opening the case next to it. This product is absolutely worth the price, and I can't believe I waited this long to purchase these!
"
SMAL694,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I LOVE my AirPods! (Photo’d with a case on, which is not included) Honestly these are the best headphones on the market. The noise cancellation and sound quality are wonderful! These headphones literally suck the air out of your ears and you hear what you’re playing clearly! And it’s super convenient that you can control wether or not the noise cancellation is on via your phone. I don’t recommend having it on when out and about or going for a run. Personally I think these are best for every day use, but not so much if you’re a runner or exercising.,Battery seems to last forever as long as you remember to charge the case about once a week!
"
CS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Just received the Apple AirPods. The first order was lost so I received a replacement and was really looking forward to getting them. Second set arrived quickly. They fit well and are comfortable. Unfortunately my disappointment is the noise cancelling. It does not appear to be what I had hoped. Though they do lessen outside noise, they are not noise canceling which is why I purchased them. Thinking of returning.

   Let me just say say that I have wanted these for a long time, but was never willing to spend the amount of $ it would cost when these first came out. I purchased 4 different brands of blue tooth ear buds and none of them were worth the time it took to set them up. I was beginning to think wireless headphones just weren’t for me. Thank goodness I decided to give these a shot and I was fully prepared to return them by the weekend. So, I finally got tired of waiting and went for it. I am so happy I did. These are great! The sound is perfect! Very easy to set up and I am most surprised at how comfortable they are. I can hardly tell I have them in. The ear pieces they came with already on are a perfect fit.  No need to try others. I took the video of me opening them because I was so excited to finally get them that I wanted to memorialize the moment. 😁 These are worthy of all the hype and that is why I gave them 5 stars.
"
Luis R. Padilla,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound is great.  Noise cancellation is good but it is difficult to switch from one mode to another (transparency to Noise cancellation).  The noise cancellation is quite good for the small size if they are well fit, but the fit test is difficult to access on the iPhone/iPad. The instructions do not explain how to use the touch buttons, which are confusing.,The most annoying part is that every time you put them on your ear your phone starts auto-playing music.  Doesn't matter if you want to do something else.,While the product is good itself, Apple still has a lot of work to do for it to interact well with iPhones and iPads.

  I don’t say this lightly.  While there are some things that the I pad air can’t do that are better done on a laptop, those things are not that much In the grand scheme of things.  I had a MacBook Air that I used and I can say that 90 percent of what I did on the MacBook Air , I was able to replicate on the IPad Air, Once you have a decent keyboard .  Plus having a touchscreen and being able to carry it everywhere is a plus.  Get one and try it for 30 days and see if I’m not right.

Modem User,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded from an iPad Air 2 to this one.  It has a very annoying feature that makes me wish I had kept my version 2.  There is an ever present thin bar at the bottom of the screen that the user touches and moves to close and home the screen instead of just pressing the home button.  The bar never goes away and can interfere with what is being displayed.  It is VERY annoying.  I hope Apple has the sense to get rid of this in one of their upgrades.

  For clarification: I purchased these on Apple.com. I am just posting my review here.,When you take these headphones out of the box you immediately notice the weight. Seeing as they are made of mostly metal, besides the replaceable ear cups and headband, this is not too surprising. The metal gives these headphones a very premium feel. The removable ear cups are very soft and comfortable and also easily replaceable (connected via magnets).,The comfort of these headphones rivals most of the other headphones that I own or have owned. I have been comparing these to my Pioneer DJ HDJ-X10s and my Sennheiser PXC 550-IIs. The pioneer headphones are made for long listening sessions and DJ sets and the new Apple headphones tend to be more comfortable than those. When I initially got them I had them on for over 5 hours without any discomfort. Also, a common problem with some over ear headphones is that your ear my start to get hot or sweat over time. That has not been a problem with these headphones. The ear cups are not made out of a non-breathable leather which I am assuming is the reason why my ears do not heat up or sweat over time. The mesh at the top of the headband aids in the comfort. The other thing that makes these comfortable is the various adjustment points. From the telescoping arms to the ball point hinges, you can get an almost perfect fit for your head shape.,Now let's talk about the sound quality. I will fist start off by stating that the noise cancelation, compared to the PXC 550-II is significantly better. It does not completely cancel out all noise however, it does a better job. I think. this is due to the metal design and the mass amount of microphones that they have located in various location on the headphones. When you use the transparency mode these microphones really shine! When this mode is active, and no music is playing, I can clearly hear myself as if I did not have the headphones on at all! Very impressive hardware and software magic from Apple. When actually playing music, in my opinion, the quality rivals a large selection of over ear headphones expect the high end audiophile range. The lows are not muddy and the mids and highs come through very crisp. The clarity is most likely due to the fact that the headphone boasts a 40mm driver which is large enough to reproduce a wide range of frequencies at high volumes without distortion or clipping.,I am a big fan of the tactile buttons and Digital Crown that they have on the headphones for control. This control interface is simple and easy to learn and use daily. The noise cancelation button allows you to cycle between the various noise cancelation modes and in the software you can choose which of the three modes it cycles between (see image). Te Digital Crown is exactly like what you will find on the Apple Watch, only bigger. Scrolling on the watch allows for volume control, and clicking allows for play/pause.,Using these headphones with Apple devices is pretty much as expected, seamless. I will say that you will need to ensure that you devices are updated to the latest operating system in order to fully enjoy all of the features.,Battery life so far is very good! The smart case helps maintain battery life when not in use. From regular use I can go about three days before I need to charge them again. Now that is not travel days. If you travel a lot you may have to charge them more often. Everyones use case is different.,Let me talk about the things that I don't like about these headphones. FYI these may be just personal gripes and might not bother you nor do they take away from the function of the headphones. The first issue that I have is that Apple is still trying to hold onto the lighting charging port. I really wish the would have put a USB C charging port on these headphones bringing them into the rapidly forming universal charging world that is here. The second gripe I have is with the case. If you look at the images I provided you can see how there are gaps in the case. This bothers me slightly because if I were to put these in my backpack on my daily commute there is a chance that something could slip in and scratch the ear cups. Now, I will see if this happens over time but it was not something that I had to deal with with my PXC 550-II because the case for those was completely covering of the headphones.,I will add to this review overtime as use these headphones more...

  Sadly, the availability is limited and the order/waiting period is annoying. I received a set of Apple AirPods MAX headphones today and they were freezing cold from the delivery truck. It took an hour or two to warm up and charge the depleted battery. The connection to the Apple iPhone XS was simple. I found myself listening to some clean & pristine music within minutes of connecting.,My first piece, as a sample was Allegri's MISERERE by the Tallis Scholars. It's an a cappella piece from the 1630s. I like to use this track that's over 12 minutes because it is a perfect example of the headphones ability to handle silence. As there are no instruments and no backing vocals, MISERERE is a great way to test new headphones. I have to say, these new APPLE headphones are stunning, very expensive at almost $600 but might be justifiable.,The noise cancellation feature is the best I have ever encountered. I cannot make any commentary about planes, airports or trains since I don't travel. I can say this: my Whirlpool dishwasher was running and I could not hear it.,To anybody, thinking about buying these cans, go ahead...pull the trigger.
"
C ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have both - In similar color schemes! Hopefully the pictures do them justice! From an aesthetics perspective the AirPods Max are on an entirely different level. The ear muffs are super soft aluminum with just the right amount of shine. For the most part the NC700s are plastic construction, which isn’t quite as remarkable but does make possible the much lighter overall weight. Confessions from an audiophile - the AirPods Max deliver on every metric i care about. These are high quality headphones that will have you rediscovering the music you thought you knew inside and out. Not to say that the NC700s aren’t excellent as well but they don’t produce the same depth of bass or clarity in songs. Cost aside, I would choose the AirPods Max over the NC700s.

Paul from Berkeley,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought the Max online from Apple directly and picked it up at the local Apple store. I returned it the following week to the local Apple store. Apple hasn't asked me for any comments but someone on Amazon may find what I experienced helpful.,My impressions of the Apple Max headphones are not comprehensive. They apply to the one feature that to me is the most important for headphones: sound reproduction and its fidelity to the original. That doesn't mean that comfort and ease of use don't matter, but once those are acceptable, then where do we go?,There's good coordination with Airplay and Apple watch and an easy set up - all as you would expect from Apple. I didn't use the active noise canceling feature but passive noise canceling is excellent: I put on the Max, turned on my noisy space heater, and had to test the heat with my fingers to see that it was on.,You place the cans on your head and they're up and running. The bass is rich and the highs are decent but, unless they are singled out in the music, they are obscured by the wall of mid: high mid, low mid, and the vast, rich, middle range. There's nice spatial separation and presence but the music never experiences silence. When music stops, at the end of a note or a measure, for example, even for an instant, there is a pause but it is at the same level of energy as the music which preceded and follows it. With good reproduction you will hear, where it is appropriate, silence - you will hear it, and it will be satisfying. Here you are never satisfied. With a good system the music speaks, there is a crispness of expression, there are overtones, there is nuance; with these headphones the music slurs. The Apple headphones don't breathe, the air just flows, on and on - this is elevator music, pleasant elevator music, true, and, perhaps, if you just want something to while away the time, sufficient. Despite the supreme comfort of these cans the listening experience for me is unfulfilling and tedious - and it makes me sad to see such potential (and these are quite special devices) wasted.,I have high-end high impedance open-back headphones and a good (trans)portable amp which I use most of the time. It isn't noise canceling (it's open-back) and it's wired. I would have liked the Max as an alternative choice for cafe and travel. I love the idea of wireless but I'm partial to good reproduction and to have my music (mostly classical) sound as close as possible to the original thing. I did alternate the Max with this system but there was no intention of comparing - especially after I listened to what the Max had to say.,I tried another tack. I have a decent midrange closed back headphone, low impedance and plugged directly into the 3.5 mm headphone jack on my 6s; not noise canceling but it's got a close ear fit and I've enjoyed listening to it on airplanes - price: $150. I feel like I've stepped off the elevator and into a concert hall. There are instruments being played not far away and I'm thrilled by what I'm hearing. When I listen to the same music with the Max, I hear sound - finely processed sound on a large stage - but I don't hear an instrument playing; I hear a technician's take on what that instrument might sound like: it's close but it's not in the same ballpark.

  I purchased a pair of Space Grey Airpod Max at the Apple Store on launch date. I'm an owner of original Airpods since inception (which I absolutely love and still consider one of Apple's most impressive products from a value to quality standpoint), and a one-time owner of Airpod Pros which I ultimately returned (I did not find them comfortable with the in-canal component of it).,I owned the Airpod Max for a few weeks. Here are my pros and cons:,Pros:,-Very easy setup, excellent connection to Apple devices. This works seamlessly between each device you use.,-Spatial audio is a very cool feature,-The aluminum material is second to none in making the product appear high-end. Very cool looking in person.,-Noise cancelling is excellent on this device.,-EQ is balanced and neutral tones. The sound is very clean.,-They are surprisingly comfortable on the head with the material used on the cups.,-Nice airy sound stage and notable instrument separation,-Battery holds up strong,Cons:,-These are HEAVY. As in, you can't do anything except sit down and listen to them heavy. Now over time you do get used to it, but there is some fatigue. Definitely not for walking outside of the home and definitely not for any kind of physical workout.,-There is no way to turn off the device without placing back into the case. There is no button to turn them off manually.,-The case is just terrible. Easy to take in and out, but you literally use the most delicate part of the headset to carry them. The case does not protect anything.,-These clamp hard. So if you aren't used to heavy clamping, you may get headaches from wearing these.,-One of my biggest gripes: the sound is nowhere as crisp as I was anticipating based on reviews. I found the mids and vocals to be receded which was very surprising. I expected the sound quality to be above and beyond any headset I've owned. That was just not the case. This is something that can be tweaked in a firmware push.,-The customization level of the EQ is a fraction if its competition (Sony XM4 gives excellent EQ customization for half the price as an example).,-I have the same issue with the airpod pros in that the pressure on the ears from noise cancellation gives me headaches. This one depends on the user, but despite the earphones themselves being comfortable, the pressure from the cups cause headaches.,When all is said and done, I am a person that focuses entirely on value. These simply don't sound like they are 550 dollar + tax headphones to me. The sound quality just isn't there. They don't sound bad per say, just not at that price range. I would say a more fair price for them would be around $400. Now the material is excellent and the noise cancellation is also excellent. So if that is very important to you, these may be exactly what you want. But nonetheless I would anticipate some refinements for the 2nd generation, or a price drop in the future to something more competitive in the mid $400 dollar range. I ended up returning these because bottom line is I did not find the price to match the sound quality, and they were not comfortable for long term use.

  The price gauging is scraping my forehead. Are you serious? Apple fans will buy anything with an Apple logo on it, no matter the cost .hey do make some great products. As an audiophile however, the buck stops here. Audiophiles pay for the sound quality and innovation. Apple fans buy Apple wearables to ""show off"" like, look at me, I am awesome because I spent. you know it, $600 on bluetooth headphones. What a total crock. I would take that same $600 and buy a beautiful DAC/AMP or some great Sennheisers or Beyerdynamic. Not this wireless Bluetooth crap. Score again for Apple. I am not a hater, I use a MacBook Pro daily. I am very much against price gauging for the sake of owning the latest Apple product. And by the way, what ever happened to Beats by Dre? You see, its the perfect opportunity for Apple to strike, and they do, in a very ferocious way. Fanboy and girls sit down. I have a bridge with an Apple logo on it for sale.
"
Ryan D,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I should have known this would happen. When these went on sale I was like, ""Nope. Not interested Especially at the price gouging price"". But Apple always wins in the end. So yesterday I bought these on the spur of the moment. (Maybe they should actually stop sending me stimulus checks).,NOISE CANCELLING: Amazing. Better than the Sony XM4's. Goodbye annoying rumbling bass through my wall when my apartment neighbor has his TV on. Best ANC I've ever experienced.,COMFORT: Surprisingly great. And I wear glasses. With the weight, I worried about the comfort, but these feel great. Possibly also better than the XM4's. Those are lighter but the drivers stick out and youu can feel them against your ear. Gets annoying after wearing them for a while. These feel much lighter than they are and the earpads are like pillows from heaven.,LOOKS: Also great. Better than in pictures. They look beautiful and shiny. Understated. I think I like the surprising decision to not put the Apple logo on them.,SOUND: Okay......here's where I'm struggling. I'm having trouble warming up to their sound. Yes, they sound clearer and have more realistic bass than the XM4's, but I think I might prefer the Sony's anyway. Their sound is just warmer and more enjoyable for music. Remember when it comes to music, ""accuracy"" isn't the only thing. CD's are more accurate than vinyl, yet many vastly prefer the sound of vinyl anyway. These to me sound just a bit cold and sterile. I hope I change my mind. And there just might be something to headphone burn-in so maybe their sound will slightly change after more hours of use.,Basically Apple nails it in many ways, but I'm underwhelmed by the sound and therefore I would say don't be foolish like me and blow $550 especially if you already have a nice pair of noise cancelling headphones. Spend your stimulus check buying beer and pizza like any good American.

  AirPods Pro are no longer a goto pair of ANC earbuds. The latest firmware upgrade from 4A400 to from 4A402 by Apple has practically remove ANC, and downgraded the audio quality due to the drastic ANC removal. Back to my Sony earbuds; these AirPods Pros are now shelved.,Update - With the firmware release from Apple of 4C165; ANC has made a return to AirPods Pro; thank you Apple for correcting one of your mistakes.
"
Kristen Dyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Warning: if the previous version fit your ears well, these won’t. I lost my original AirPods and ordered the AirPods 3 to replace them, and they were way too big for my ears. There’s no way they would stay in while running and my ears hurt after like 1 min of wearing them. The sound was good and everything, but I’m so glad I was able to return these and get the older AirPods 2 which fit my ears!
"
Gadget guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods Pro are the most amazing piece of technology I own. I am totally blown away by the Incredibly efficient noise cancellation. It beats my over the ear Bose AirComfort 2. The malleable ear pieces insure a snug comfortable fit and effectively block out outside noise.,I cannot understand conversations in noisy background environments. One of the primary reasons I bought these AirPods was the conversation boost feature. I was not disappointed, this feature makes a world of difference. I can actually understand people talking!,If you are considering  purchase of ear buds, these are the best you can buy in my opinion.

Charles,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first pair of Apple AirPods, and I can't say I'm impressed.  Apple products, back in the day, were supposed to be simple, logical and easy to use, but the functionality of these is not good.  My biggest grip is the controls.  The AirPods have a small sensor strip on each bud that can be used to turn the noise cancellation on or off, to pause music, or to go move to the next track or prior track.  That's it, and the controls cannot be changed in the AirPods Pro.  On my other earbuds (the Jabra elite), I can customize the controls, and I can also use the buds to change the volume.  I can't believe that the AirPods can't be customized.  Crazy.  More seriously, the sensor strip is EXTREMELY difficult to use.  My Jabras have a button on each bud that is incredibly easy to press, even 9 miles into a run.  The AirPods?  There is this small metal sensor strip that has to be pressed just right.  The only way to do it is to sort of pinch the earbud, pressing the strip with one finger while holding the back of the AirPod stalk so that it doesn't fall out.  This is not easy, and I find it a nightmare in running.  I end up pulling the stupid AirPods out by accident just trying to move forward a track.  I can't believe Apple thought this was a good control scheme.  On the positive size, the fit for me is perfect, and the AirPods are light.  The sounds quality is good too ---- the Jabras sound noticeably better with music, but the call quality on the AirPods seems a bit better than the Jabras.  At any rate, all in all, I'm not happy with these.  If I'd realized how tricky these are to use in real life, I never would have bought them, even on sale.

Allen Durwood,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Solid sound. I feel like the Soundcore Liberty Air 2s I was using had more oomph — and the Beats Fit Pro I bought to replace these sound way better. ANC is cool, kills the hell out of the battery though. Four hours with it on seems kinda… pushing it.,My biggest issue was the fit. Not only do they come loose constantly, it’s also almost impossible to move them without hitting the force sensor. Maybe it’s because of my hands (they’re huge) but I was constantly pulling up Apple Music while using my Mac, which was incredibly frustrating.,Actually, I was going to rate these a three, but because Apple Music automatically came up any time I touched the force sensor, I’m dropping it to a one. It was that frustrating.

  Gen 3 were purchased and daughter initially liked. However after wearing a few times she felt they were too large and uncomfortable.  She gifted the Gen 3s to me and we purchased the Pros. The Pros fit much better in her ears. I also tried the Pros on when they arrived and they fit much better. The Gen 3s fall out easier and do cause some discomfort. I suppose it’s all about the size of your ear canals.

copr165,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have the original AirPods and two pairs of the Pros. Wife has set of Pros along with my daughter. My wife just recently got hers and cannot stand anything in her ears so she was using an old Motorola earpiece to talk handsfree on her phone. I talked her into trying the Pros when they were on sale for Thanksgiving and when they arrived I put the smallest ear tip and she actually uses them. Sound quality is great and they are comfortable. Had all of mine since they were launched and they work great and automatically connect to whatever device I am using. Quality product and recommend highly!

  These airpods fit perfectly in my ears.  I was worried after so many reviews mentioned this version did not fit.  (The 2nd generation also fit my ears).  These sound fantastic and I love how they automatically switch between my devices.  I prefer these over silicone tips any day.
"
Brittany Vaughan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had to return the first pair I received. Was a little upset at the fact it says they’re new and when I took them to Apple to try and figure out why the left one wouldn’t work it told them they were serviced. Which means they were not new. However Amazon fixed the problem sent me new ones and they work fine
"
Brent Lindner,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Used, not new.  Look carefully for the Apple seals on 2 sides.  Return immediately if it’s not.  I bought them as a gift and the new owner realized it when there was only a couple of months left to claim the 6mos Apple Music.  Rating is for my experience.  I’d give a genuine AirPods Gen 3 a 5 star rating.
"
Gary L. Mabrey,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very disappointed.  My AirPod Pros were very temperamental. The noise cancelling feature did not work consistently and I constantly had trouble with my iPhone and iPad not recognizing that both pods were in my ears.  I tried every tip size and none seemed to correct the problem. Maybe it’s my specific ears and the poor fit, but I give up and these will be returned. My Bose earbuds don’t have this problem so I’ll probably try the new Bose or the new Sony’s  next.  When they did work, the sound quality was pretty good and on par with my other high quality earbuds but not significantly better or significantly worse.
"

  New Apple AirPods Pro,Works perfectly with my iPhone. Syncs quickly, good interface, battery life is pretty good considering how small they are.,Sound is great, noise cancellation is amazing.,I dropped one and used 'FindMy' on the iPhone which located them to about 2 inches.,What more could you ask for?,I'm quite happy with these.
"
Dro420Savage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My AirPod pros are the best! I’ve used them traveling, at home & while driving. The best ones available in my opinion! On a plane with noise canceling I couldn’t even hear the engines of the plane & same with in the car or noisy environments! The transparency mode is great! If you listening to something but also want to stay alert around you, it’s fantastic & the way I mainly use them. Battery life is good but not great. If your on a longer trip I’d recommend bringing a power bank. They last about 4 to 5 hours on a single full charge but I’d say the case itself charges the both the AirPods 2 to 3 times fully. I would recommend buying AirPod pros without a doubt!
"
Jessica Hart,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought what I thought was an Apple Product from this sender only to find, after my spouse opened the gift on Christmas day, various differences in quality! For one, the charger does not fit into the Air Pod case; and its suppose to fit fully, snuggly& securely. Second, the back of the Air Pods has a button that when clicked actually doesn't make much of a clicking sound/noise at all, its suppose to be ""muted""; however, with this product when you click the button it makes a loud, tacky clicking sound, revealing that it is not made with the same quality products as Apple. Lastly, and most importantly, after this product connected with my spouses iPhone 12Mini, it did not recognize the iPhone and thus, did not work or play music from the Air Pods! DO NOT BUY APPLE FROM THIS SENDER AND RECOMMEND BUYING APPLE ONLY FROM APPLE OR BEST BUY.  Amazon needs to vet this sender! I am in the process of returning now to sender.

  EDIT: ok so I went to my Apple store and they replaced it hassle free. I was actually dumbfounded by how easy it was. I’m sorry I doubted you Apple,5/5 quality product and customer service,Old review:,Very nice product but my iPad came with a dead pixel. The product works fine and the pixel is very small, but since I know it’s there it is the first thing my eyes dart to when I look at my iPad. I don’t see it worth it to return the product because what if my replacement has a worse flaw.,Still, so far a very good product, just disappointed to have that flawed pixel. You’d think Apple would have better checks for these type of things considering what they charge for them.,4/5 pretty good product

  I got these for my wife for Christmas to replace her Sony noise cancellation headphones which although have great noise cancellation features, are bulky and take up lots of space when traveling.  So, I'm not sure if we got a ""dud"" or not, but these Apple AirPods Pro have absolutely no noise cancellation whatsoever.  We've tried all of the different sized ear plugs and there is no difference between OFF, TRANSPARENCY or NOISE CANCELLATION modes.  When we put her Sony headphones on, we can barely hear a tv while standing next to it.  Put these AirPods in and we hear every word on the TV.  Glad Amazon has returns as these are going back.
"
LG,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As a user of most apple headsets through my life, I have found the Pros are the best out there. With slick features such as noise cancelation, transparent, or regular setting. Having the ability to change how you listen while listening give you maximum enjoyment. With a good charging time and well rounded information on when to charge them gives customers the power to have the best headsets at all times. As a person who enjoys going to the gym I was very skeptical if they would stay in my ears or fall out and get damaged. Luckily with he new adjustable ear piece. I have had no problems with this and trust in them to stay in my ears through all workouts. Overall with this product I have felt it was worth the extra money and has been the best pair of headsets I have owned. I would strongly recommend this product for active music listener, people who enjoy working out, or business people needed to listen without distractions.

  I have ALWAYS used the corded ear pods for price AND I knew I would not lose them...and they did the job. I have used cordless off brand ear pods and they were okay, but always went back to my corded ones. The Apple AirPod Pros were on sale during the Black Friday week sales so I purchased and have used several times on multiple flights, and it blocks out all the plane noise and annoying passengers that cannot keep their mouths closed. It pairs almost instantly and charges quickly and stays charged for a long time...at least for the duration of my flights so far. No complaints!

"
S. Walker,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  With any wireless device including headphones, I never had a problem with connecting once they were paired. With this one, I open the case near my phone, get the pop up thing, put them in my ear and.....no sound. Whatever I am listening to does not come through, it goes to the phone speaker. I have checked the bluetooth manager in Settings, and they registered as connected (not just paired, but actively connected). So I end up taking them out of my ears, putting them back in the case, closing it, opening it again, taking them out to see if it will take. I have had to do this at least 3 times, every single time. They are nice headphones, but I don't understand why the simple act of connecting (actually connecting) is like this. I don't understand why I have to put them back in the case instead of just managing it from the Bluetooth menu like every other bluetooth device I have ever used.,Advice is welcome.

  I had been researching the AirPods 3 and these AirPods Pro for quite some time. After looking at a comparison video on “Unbox Therapy” I made the decision to go pro lol.,So glad I did. Equally happy that I purchased these babies here and not at the apple store for $249 (plus tax). Got them at $179. Talk about a steal.,The quality of sound that you’re greeted with is just amazing. The spatial audio is an entire experience and that noise canceling feature just places you in a world by yourself. Man, just get them.,Very happy with this purchase.
"
Mark,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased these to use with my Apple TV and I am not sure I like them; however, I am only using them to watch non-musical programs mostly. They do block external sound to a small degree. As far as using them with the Music app, I am spoiled by the Bose noise-cancelling head phones with the larger soft, flexible rubber inserts - but those are not wireless.  No matter the size I try, these Apple buds  will not stay in my ears and eventually edge out after a while.  Perhaps I have weird ears. They are easy to use, however, and are recognized easily by all Apple devices and have controls on the buds themselves, although I have not mastered the tap maneuvers yet.

  You buy these for the convenience and not the sound. Having said this, these buds are super convenient to use and sound pretty good too. The noise cancellation is very efficient. I even like Spatial Audio even though it’s gimmicky. They connect to my Apple devices effortlessly. Battery life is good and better with a fully charged case. Would buy it again.
"
Enzo M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple AirPods Pro sound pretty good though not great by audiophile standards. They’re comfortable, at least in my ears for long listening sessions (three + hours) and the noise canceling is as good as can be expected for ear pods of this price/class. I have not tried any other brand’s noise canceling ear pods so I cannot say how good they are compared to any of the competition. Considering all factors overall, these are great. Very convenient to carry around and use and they sound good enough for daily listening if your not after the absolute sound.

"
Impetigo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like these headphones a lot overall but here is the breakdown (I got it from the local Apple Store):,GOOD:,- APPLE ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION: You will definitely like these more the greater your integration with the Apple ecosystem.  That is, if you have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook/iMac, Apple TV, etc. you will find these headphones to work seamlessly and flawlessly overall.  I love that it automatically pairs with my iPhone when it's next to it even if it was last connected to my Apple TV or iMac/MBA.  I love how I can check the battery life on my iPhone or Mac notification bar or widgets.  Pairing, connecting, etc. is a breeze with other Apple products.  Never have a problem connecting to any of my Apple devices, which is unlike every other wireless/bluetooth headphone/earphone I've ever used (from Sony, Bose, Beats).  I love using this with my Apple TVs, Macs (MacBook Airs, iMacs), iPad, and iPhone.,- GOOD AESTHETIC & FUNCTIONAL DESIGN: I don't love it, but I think they look nice overall.  I love the cool, smooth metal used on the cans, even if it does add some weight.  I like how all the controls are on the R can and not split between the two.  I like the digital crown for volume and pause/start.  I like the button for toggling noise cancellation modes.,- SOUND QUALITY: They sound good, but not noticeably better than my older Beats Studio Wireless cans.  Bass response is good if you like your bass.  But they also don't have problems connecting via bluetooth every other time I use them like the Beats so that more than makes up for it.,THE BAD:,- COST: Yeah, it's the ""Apple tax.""  Love it or hate it, all Apple products come with them.,- NO WALL ADAPTER: I really hate how Apple has stopped including AC wall adapters with their recent products.  This only comes with a lightning to USB-C cable.,THE NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD:,- BATTERY LIFE: It may not be the best in class but it is decent (but not great).  I think 10 hours per charge (using noise cancellation or ""transparency"" mode) is a stretch though.  More like 6 hours or so.,- COMFORT: It is neither super comfortable nor uncomfortable.  The cans are taller than wide so depending on your ear shape you may find it more or less comfortable for extended periods of time.  I find them to be too narrow and get tiring on my ears after using them for a while, but it gets better with some adjustment.  I also find the design of the arch over the head part to be not terribly comfortable, with the flexible mesh between the parallel bars being not that comfortable (can't press them down as the mesh doesn't keep the bars from pressing on your head).,- CASE: I think the ""bra/handbag"" case gets a lot of undeserved hate.  It is obviously not intended to be a travel case, simply a case to keep the headphones in battery conservation mode (if you have AirPods you know how fast those suckers lose their battery if left outside their charging case).  A case that could charge the phone inside it is not feasible, nor is a wireless charging design.  It just wouldn't work.  But for what it is designed to do -- keep it clean and in battery saving mode -- it does the job and is totally fine.  What I don't like is how the cutout for the lightning cable is a quarter inch off from where the port would be, which is annoying as I can't easily plug in the cord without causing some tension on the port due to the case getting in the way.,- LIGHTNING PORT: I don't mind this that much since I have so many lightning cables, but USB-C probably would have made more sense.,OVERALL:  These really only make sense for people who have numerous Apple devices as it doesn't really justify the price otherwise.  But if you are fully invested in the Apple ecosystem, then it is well worth the price.  I have AirPod Pros and find them to be complementary to each other, and I love having them both.

  Purchased from the Apple Store.  Initial assessment is truly outstanding, especially for anyone using Apple devices (iPhone, Macs, Apple TV).  The sound quality is superb within their class, far more natural sounding than Beats, Bose, Sony.  I've got 30 years as a professional musician, and I really have to use my pro grade reference headphones to get better sound, but those are all wired and most cost more than these do.  The noise cancellation is where these things really shine.  I've used Bose QC and Sony's best NC headphones, and the APM noise cancellation is faster and better than those, and the transparency mode sounds truly natural - as if you aren't wearing headphones at all - and switching back and forth is easy to do.  If you use Apple devices, you'll be very pleased with the quick seamless control over your devices, and how easily it switches between devices (a real pain with some of the top competition's headphones).,Now for the bad... and it's really bad.  These things were clearly put out before they were ready for release.  I'm currently waiting on my SECOND repair/replace in less than six months.  My first pair worked well for about six weeks, then started getting really finicky about connecting, then starting switching noise cancelation modes all by itself, then completely lost the ability to connect or reboot/reset.  So I called Apple.  I don't live near an Apple Store, so they sent me a return box that took two weeks to arrive.  I sent them in, and it took a week for them to even start the repair, and a couple more couple days for them to decide the repair was impossible and send me a new pair.  Great!  Until two weeks later when the brand new pair suddenly refused to wake up (come out of sleep mode) and could not be rebooted or reset.  So now I'm waiting on another return box to arrive.  Researching the discussion boards, I can tell you I am far from alone in this experience.,And notice, I haven't even gotten around to the lack of a power on/off option.  These headphones ""sleep"" in ultra-low power mode, but NEVER actually turn off.  AND then there's the included ""case"" which is not a case, but a slip cover that leaves all the corner edges exposed, which are the most likely to be scratched or hit.  All the slip cover does is put the headphones to sleep and give partial scratch protection (but NO impact protection).  If you buy these, or already have a pair, invest in a 3rd party smart case.,Bottom line, buying the first generation of this product is a crapshoot.  You may get a lemon, but the warranty should give you time to figure that out and get a working model, even if it takes a few tries, and when these things work as intended, they are, in my opinion, the best consumer Bluetooth over-ear noise cancelling headphones on the market, especially for apple device users.  Sincerely, they kick butt, right up until they don't.,I sincerely hope they get the bugs worked out for v 2.0.  And I'm sure they're motivated - based on the discussion boards they must be losing a ton on replacing all the duds.

  First thing first, I received mine as birthday gift so can’t say it’s worth paying $550..that’s up to you to decide. would I pay $550 out of my own pocket? Probably not..they’re probably worth $450 in my book. I also own Sony XM 3, Bose 700, Audio Techica M40 X and Cowin E70.,Second: the sound, which is the main object of any headphones..Max, I will just called Max for short. They absolutely sound amazing..very crisp, clean and nice punchy bass..not super bass heavy like Beats or Skullycandy. The transparency mode and spatial sound are truly game-changer..without the doubt it’s Max’s biggest pluses. Watching movie with HD sound also very impressive. It’s Apple ecosystem only. If you own Android it’s NOT for you.,3rd: comfort, which should be 2nd most important factor..it weights a bit heavy at first but after few days of using it it feels fine. When turning head you will definitely feel the weight..surprisingly  it fits my head perfectly not falling or moving when I am jogging or jumping up and down during doing exercise. After 3 + hours of test run, it feels very comfortable and not hurting my ears..that’s the biggest surprise.,4th: build quality, it’s absolutely great material with metal and aluminum, where most of the weight are made of. However the ear cups bang into each other when you’re taking off the smart case, which might scratch or damage the ear cups long term. You can buy earscups protector, which extra $15 at Amazon.,Now the negative..there are few of them..1. No on or off bottom, which mean your Max will slowly drain in battery. Even you put in the smart case..there are rumors some Max are draining faster than other. Mine is draining very slowly..so I lucked out. 2. Condensation issue. Some Max users reported that their Max have condensation issue when water or sweat get into inside the ear cups causing damage to the drivers. Once the drivers are damage it’s unfixable therefore Max shouldn’t be used for exercise. Yes, I did use for my exercise but I didn’t sweat much. No Apple logo on the Max, which I find that to be insulting and infuriating..$550 and other people can’t tell which brand i am wearing. Bad advertisement from Apple. Last but least the smart case, which is without the doubt the worst case of any kind in human civilization history. You can buy $20 to 100 ( Waterfield ) cases. No power charger, that’s another $20. Wish the battery is bit longer. 20 hours is barely acceptable. With constant battery drainage I’ve to charge Max every 3 day.,For the first generation of Apple overhead headphones it has pluses and minuses..all and I all I lucked on all the negatives  and get all the positive..I give Max’s very impressive 9.8 out of 10 because it’s very comfortable, overall impressive sound and top notch build quality, even its few minus faults.,I recommend to anyone who appreciate great sound quality and have enough money to buy them.

Audio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have gone through thousands of dollars worth of headphones (including Sennhesier HD800S, HD700, HD650, HD600, Beyerdynamic T1 g2, DT770, V-moda M100, focal elear, monoprice M1060, Bose QC35, apple AirPods Pro’s, beats pro, beats studio, Aiaiai, etc, etc) and these AirPods Max might be an end game headphone for me.,As an audiophile and a guy who runs high quality sound systems for events (Funktion-One), these headphones have seriously good audio quality. The presentation of the mids is super clean and smooth without sounding harsh and fatiguing. This leads to very good instrument separation, clarity, and texture. A lot of boomy bass headphones have a lot of bass which may be fun at first, but it ends up muddying everything up so you can hear the bass, but you can’t feel the quality of the bass (the harmonic distortion that gives bass it’s character) and all songs end up sounding the same. With these, you can fully hear the bass to very low frequencies, but it’s not muddied at all so you can really get a sense for the texture and quality of the bass. This is very noticeable in hip hop songs where 808 bass lines all have a certain quality on them or a Tool song where the bassist has raw analog distortion on the bass track, something that is harder to hear on lesser quality headphones/speakers.,One great feature is that they sound great at low volumes too. A lot of headphones you have to turn up to a “fun” level before you can really hear the detail or get interested in the sound, but by that point you’re damaging your hearing. These stay balanced and engaging throughout the volume range.,When I have these on and go about my work, I don’t think about what the headphones sound like, I just hear the music. And it’s a huge relief and breath of fresh air to hear past the headphones and get straight to the music if that makes sense at all.,I could talk a lot longer about the quality of the sound and give examples but would probably bore the average reader. In sum, these headphones have fantastic non-fatiguing sound. The fact that they also have Bluetooth, noise cancelling, comfort, transparent mode are all a bonus.,Big buy recommendation if you want great sound that’s also usable on the go or in the office.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Can’t take mine off. Got them earlier today and am in love. Seamlessly switch between my MacBook, iphone, iPad, even Apple TV. Watched a show on Apple TV with dinner and the sound is just incredible. Did a test phone call to my brother while driving and he said I sounded clear, then I rolled down the window and he said it was still very clear. One thing I am liking also is that in transparency mode I can sing along with a song and hear myself through the headphones like I’m part of the recording. It’s kinda really awesome. Super comfortable too. Zero complaints.

Star,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you have extra money, get them. If not, not worth it. They are good headphones  for sound quality. Obviously, status, if you’re into that. But really no one cares unless it’s a 16 year old kid dreaming about them. I love the noise cancellation feature, It’s a top tier feature. I think that’s what’s your paying for. There is no button to turn them off. You have to put them in the case. The size is inconvenient. You’d have to keep these at a desk or use them for one thing only just to keep up with the case. They’re are easy to lay around and you think they’d be turned off but no, they have to be in that case! Ugg. These are small inconveniences that will annoy you once you had them a while. I own every pair of Apple headphones. I lost one ear piece to each and I’ve been relaying on these bad boys and let me tell you it kinda sucks. That’s what brings me to this review section. I been spending a lot of quality time with these things so i think my opinion is valid. I like them but if you don’t have the money don’t buy them. You won’t use them that much to validate the purpose unless there is a really good reason you want these. I use them on the plane too. I hate putting them in my book bag because they don’t fold so i just feel like they are so exposed. That case does nothing but protect the aluminum and make sure the headphones are off. I use the Sony headphones too. they have a hard protective case. I like that a lot better. I will be honest and say i use these way more because i have everything Apple but they piss me off because i always come back to the thought. These aren’t worth the price even though they’re good headphones. I just shouldn’t have these worries if i paid $600 for headphones. That’s just me though! But y’all have a good day! Hope you enjoyed my real view, i mean review! :D

DewayneLives,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are the best headphones i have used hands down. I have been looking for noise canceling headphones for a while yet every set ive tried have the vacuum feel to my ears. These Airpod ProMax are handsdown the best Noise Cancellation Headphones you will find! I have tried everything from sony to bose and there is no competition with these they are the best. The build quality is great and very durable. I would say the price is a lil high i mean just a hundred less would be better but either way these have blown my expectations out the water.,Pros,On of a kind Noise Cancellation (Tested On iPhone),Beautiful Build Quality,Fits your head amazing,Removable Ear cups (Easy cleaning and switching),Great battery life,Cons,Good sound but for the price better is available,No 3.5 Jack (Without purchasing extra dongle),The Cradle “Bra” exposes too much to get damaged,Doesnt have a on/off button (it stays in sleep mode until removed from the cradle or connects),Not designed for Android (Will work but wont have all features),Final thoughts?,If you want some nice headphones these are definitely that but i cannot condone spending this much on a set of headphones just cause they have great noise cancellation or style. Its really hard to say why not to buy these cause I really like them but in most cases i think most people would be better off getting airpod pros.

TheaCecelia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve read hundreds of reviews. Let’s face it, time well invested at this price point! I was prepared for all the bad. I purchased silicone covers for the ear pieces and the headband before the headphones even arrived (less than $20 for 5 pieces). I expected monumental disappointment with the included case. But I waited to purchase something different.,The headphones arrived (I purchased from a big box store brand new - better deal for me). First, the charging. I’m deep in the Apple ecosystem so I just plugged them into my iPhone charging cord. Simple. After charging I thoroughly enjoyed a good hour of music. Sound wise, I’m in love with the experience. These are comfortable and perform as I would expect. I placed them in the goofy included case. It too performed as intended. Absolutely zero battery drain. But I decided that my shiny new purchase required a better case. I purchased mine from Amazon.,My headphones were instantly recognized by my all my devices so I had zero connectivity issues. Devices include: phone, laptop and tablet. I easily switched between all three.,These are loud. I don’t understand why anyone would complain about them not being loud enough. You’ve got undiagnosed hearing problems if you can’t hear properly even at 50% volume. I haven’t mastered everything these have to offer but now that I’ve spent the money and enjoyed the listening experience, I regret nothing! And that’s coming from someone who has never ever spent that kind of money on headphones.,Bottom line: these headphones are expensive but amazing! They’re user friendly and everything you need to know is available on several platforms for you to make an informed decision (ie: what comes in the box and weather you need an adapter). Save your pennies and purchase them new from an authorized Apple retailer. If you’re going to drop over $500 on headphones, you should not squeal about the extra expense of maintaining their care.,I’ve spent years purchasing Apple products and out of the dozen or more products, I had one bad experience a la my wireless carrier, not Apple.

RWS Apogee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, so it made sense to try these.  I am replacing Sony XM-4s which had good sound reproduction but awful (for me) touch controls.  As expected, out-of-the-box setup was easy with them being recognized instantly by my iPhone.  Construction quality is evident with top-notch materials, tolerances, look/feel, etc.  Although some reviews are negative regarding comfort, I found them to be fine.  Make no mistake, they are heavier than headphones constructed primarily of plastics.  But I don't believe they were designed to be worn when exercising.,Sound quality and noise canceling are first rate.  These are not ""Beats-style"" bass boomers.  If you want loud, thumping bass, look elsewhere.  If you want to hear amazing clarity and nuances that you can't hear with XM-4s, give these a shot.,Multiple reviewers express displeasure with the supplied case.  My take is that the primary function of this case is to provide minimal protection while serving to put the headphones into low power mode.  Since I don't plan on taking the headphones out of the house, it's fine for me.  If I were to travel with these, or throw them in a backpack, I would put them in a lined zipper bag, or something similar.  So, again, the case is fine for in-home use, but not more than that.,If these were priced at $399, I'd give them 5 stars.  I don't mind paying a premium for Apple's typically high quality construction, ease of integration with other Apple devices, attention to detail, packaging, etc., but $549 is pushing it.  Perhaps the market will agree and these will be discounted at some point.  For now, they're definitely worth a look, but only if the price doesn't bother you.

Amber Swenson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The battery life on these is horrible. 2 to 2 1/2 hours max on one ear bud. While on meetings. If they are in constant use the don’t last long. I also have issues with them falling out of my ear. I’ve tried multiple ear bud sizes. With no luck. I do like the option of pairing them with other apple ear buds. That way two people can listen to the same thing. I wish apple would come out with something more secure to the head or neck.
"
BHaskell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As with most apple Pro products, these are made nice. Sound quality is great, and does a great job at reproducing the sound. Wish they did a little better job at noise cancellation…but that could be me not using the correct ear plug pieces seeing how this comes with 3 sizes to use. All-in-all, love these and would get them again if anything happens to the ones I have.

  I've never been a fan on Apple ear buds in the past as they never seem to stay in my ears.,This all changed with the new Air Pod Pro (3rd gen) wireless head phones.,The rubber ear pieces allow them to stay in my ears and the noise cancellation feature is great!,I can now tune out bad music played at my gym as well as conversations by other patrons.,I've had MANY issues with other wireless headphones not charging effectively but thus far the Apple Air Pod Pro have not exhibited this issue at all. I highly recommend this product!

Papuna Gaprindashvili,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  these are not active noise cancelling headphone in a same sense as Sony 1000 series are, these just mute very easy sounds but don't actually work very well at that they add some kind of tone to everything, for me its only usable for video calls and that is all I bought it for, don' think this is premium device at all, for example case is not waterproof, and its not sold separately, a big downside.,PS: I have only used it with 3rd party memory foam tips and I think they are a must for these for maximum comfort, regular ones are a bit too slippery.

Randy W. Harris,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought a pair of AirPod Pros in early 2021. Loved them from day 1. Super to connect and use, and I've never had one problem. Bought a brand new pair two weeks ago and they never worked correctly. Left ear would drop out, or ""blink"" on and off. I read every forum post, every *fix* available. Reset the AirPods. Click ""Forget Device"" in the BT settings and repair. Take them out of your ears and put them in the charger, reset and resync. Couldn't select ""Noise Cancellation"" because ""Both pods have to be in your ears."" Conducted the ear tip fit"" test. Never fixed. I would think it was working, then the left pod would blink on and off, almost like when you're walking out of range from your phone.,Lots of people online have this issue and many more have potential fixes. None worked for me. Apple dropped the ball big time on this one, either because the new Pods have an issue or the iOs does, or maybe both. Would not recommend these pods if you're running iOS 15.2

  The best earbuds I've ever used. I didn't believe people when they said how good these were until I got my hands on some for myself. They were paired almost instantly as soon as I took them out of the box. The noise cancellation is incredible!!!! And the transparency mode makes it possible to keep your AirPods in while checking out at the grocery store or any situation like that. These are awesome and WELL worth the $200 price point I paid for them. i just wish the battery life of the case was better, but even so I HIGHLY recommend these.

  I have had these a little over a week and the left ear bud won’t charge. Even though it says it’s 100% it dies within 15 minutes. I upgraded from the regular AirPods and they are supremely better in sound quality but for something so expensive I would expect better. They also have a hard time staying in my ears at the gym, it tiring constantly adjusting them and pushing them back into my head. The music controls don’t work that great, it will pause music but I can’t get them to skip tracks, unpause or reverse without using my watch or phone. Things to consider…

  I use these constantly. One of my favorite uses is with yard work. I would say that they eliminate 90% of the sound of my lawn mower. I can listen to music at a lower volume than with the cheaper pair that I used to use. They charge quickly. The fit was a little bit suspect for me, but I have had similar issues in the past. I purchased the ""COMPLY Foam Apple AirPods Pro 2.0 Earbud Tips for Comfortable, Noise-Canceling Earphones That Click On, and Stay Put (Small, 3 Pairs)"" and they made the fit much better and more comfortable.

  It took me a while to decide buying this because of the price ticket. So I waited and I got them on the BF sale. I am amazed at the quality of the sound and the level of noise cancellation, when I have them on noise cancellation mode and I'm doing dishes I can barely hear the garbage disposer when I run it. And believe me it makes a racket. The same goes for when my husband is using his awfully noisy tools inside the house.,They are definitely worth the price....... as, IMHO, is everything with the Apple label on it 😉

  Before them I always had Jaybird earphones and can tell you that Jaybird has a way superior sound quality for any type of music I tried. The bass and sound quality is superior to the iPods, but the Jaybird Vista 2 (latest and best Jaybird yet) doesn’t have the Noice Cancelation quality that the AirPods Pro have.,If you are looking for a good Noice Cancelation, awesome pairing with you apple devices, then YOU NEED THIS. But if you are looking for the best sound quality, then there are several other brands that can offer you more quality at the same or lower price. L

  Take that bra case and trash it or throw it on ebay for 20$. Get yourself an actual case here on Amazon. I got one for like 15$... With that, it's great. I agree the normal case is impressively pointless. Just replace it. There's a reason companies make 3rd party cases. It sucks that you have to buy a case for 550$, but I without any doubt say the quality of these makes them worth it.,The sound? God tier. It won't beat your equally priced audiophile grade studio monitors. It just won't. But go ahead and go outside of your custom made quiet home with these and your monitors, and you'll understand that the AirPhones (yes) Max 100% have a place with you.,My point is, studio headphones sound better in a completely noiseless room. But anyone who owns open back monitors knows exactly how they sound with other noise like traffic or people talking. It makes it not worth it. These address that, and I personally would prefer using the AirPhones in a environment that isn't completely quiet,Not to mention they're bluetooth. Good luck finding bluetooth headphones in this price range that sound this good.,And one more thing. They're actually very serviceable and repairable. I'm sure you know the earpads come right off about as satisfyingly as an iPad magnetic folio cover. But did you also know that soft fragile looking headband is replaceable? I haven't had any issues with durability with it but If I did, I could replace the headband. The earcups come right off the headband stem by putting a sim card tool in the little hole that's directly below the stem. See the iFixit teardown for details about that, I highly urge you to not just start jamming a sim tool in random holes in your 550$ headphones. I recommend you not to do it or to figure out how to do it right with help from something like iFixit.

Addison,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality of airpods was amazing when they came out. I bought these expecting a bigger sound experience than what I got with my airpod pros but was disappointed. They are designed well and the comments about sweating are not a big concern - that will happen with other devices be it in in-ear or over-ear. It just happens. For me I was bummed that it sounded like the airpod pro sound funneled into larger space that made it less robust. I was surprised by this but it actually sounds more echo-ish as if it's in a bare room.,I'm not trying to slam Apple but to compare I did buy a competitor (top shelf, less expensive) product and I got what I was expecting. The sweating thing happened there too btw...maybe you folks need to wash your ears more often? I dunno. It's not an AC unit so check your environment lol.

  I know that the cost of these headphones are more than some other brands. On the surface the other brands may seem offer a similar experience for less money. But “similar” is not the “same”.,I truly believe those in the Apple “walled garden” will love these Apple headphones. I know I do. Comfort is very good, even though they weigh more than the usual competitors. But that is a tribute to their design.,After a week with these headphones I tuned myself in on the controls and the connection to Apple devices. The fact is these headphones are so well designed to work with Apple products, I initially made things harder on myself than I needed to. I guess I didn’t expect them to mesh this well with my Apple iPad Pro, iPhone and MacMini.,BlueTooth range, and sound quality is far superior to any other big brand wireless headphones I have ever owned or auditioned. I use the headphones with Apple Music and Tidal. Yes,,I know, these BT headphones cannot support “lossless” audio streaming, like my wired headphones. But see below:,I’m enjoying these almost as much as my cabled Sennheiser HD-650 and Audeze LCD-2 headphones driven by a DAC/amplifier.  Note I said “almost”. I don’t want to be thrown out of the “headphone audiophile club” ;),But wireless has its compensations. I can do projects around the house, and lounge on my deck. Not to mention enjoying great sound during travel. BTW ANC and transparency modes are fabulous!,My only concern is whether the headphone band will wear well. My initial dislike of the case is something that I got over. I did order a third party case for travel.,I think the aluminum ear cups could certainly get scratched or dinged up. So I added a ear cup cover accessory. There are multiple options on Amazon.,Do yourself a favor and consider how deep you want to dive into the Apple “walled garden”. I’m glad I did!

Expatcalifornian,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Regardless of the fact that these are limited to AAC resolution and Apple has said they will not be able to play their new high resolution files at full resolution, the sound quality on these is fantastic. Better than several other 'audiophile' headphones in the same price range that I have tried (with a separate DAC AND Amp). The noise cancellation is the best I have heard. They work great with my iphone, as they should. And they are very nicely finished and comfortable.,Irritations and quirks- they don't interface flawlessly with my macbook pro. Had to go into system settings and force the sound to go through the headphones instead of the portable's speakers.  and had to do it again when I wanted to watch another show the next day.  And while watching a movie in another room, the headphones would sometimes switch to whatever I had last played on my phone, not good. they seem designed to look for the phone over anything else. the lack of a charger is irritating at the price (come on Apple, not even a dinky 5 w charger like you used to include with iphones?) and I wish it was a usb c port instead of the lightning port, that way I could use my laptop's charger on both without changing cables. And the 'case' is a joke. But again, sound is terrific, very comfortable, nice looking. And if you do want one, wait for one of the flash sales, price dropped 30 bucks over the weekend a few weeks back, just for that weekend.

  Upfront its obvious that these are expensive, especially when there's the Sony XM4's, Bose 700's, and many other quality options on the market for a third less than the Airpods Max or less than that.  However, as soon as you pick these up, you can feel the quality of the build of materials Apple put into these.  They're heavy to hold but theyre no problem to wear because of the mesh canopy.  I've sat with these on my head every day for 6-10 hours since December (ordered from Apple) and the top of my head never feels any pain or pressure whatsoever.  This is different than my experience with my prior headphones, the Sony XM4's, that would start to hurt and get sweaty around the top band and earcups after a couple hours.,Another comparison that is night and day is the noise cancelling.  They handily beat the Airpods Pro in noise cancelling and definitely also edge out the XM4's as well.  You don't have the option to tune how heavy the NC is like with the Sony or Bose mobile apps, but I prefer max NC anyway so it's not a problem for me.  Transparency mode on the Airpods Max is also bar none the best implementation over any other headphone.  The audio piped in from your environment feels like you're not even wearing giant earcups over your ears because it sounds identical to what you'd hear in the real world.,The sound is extremely good as well.  I am not an audiophile by any means and these obviously aren't trying to compete with Sennheiser's Orpheus headphones or anything, but turning on NC, blasting your favorite song and closing your eyes gives you quite a fun experience you get lost in.,Controls on the Airpods Max, the digital crown and NC toggle button are also nice and vastly superior to the touch controls or multiple button on the side of the earcup setup most headphone companies use.  It's dead simple to use, quick to access, and you can get precise volume increment changes if needed.,The extra features you're familiar with from Airpods or Beats like quick paring, auto switching, icloud pairing, etc, is all there and works just fine as you'd expect if you have used them before.,The only downside I can think of is the case.  It's not super protective (although not as bad as I feel like the media hounded it for), its weird looking, and its annoying to fold the headphones into and out of each time.  Most of the time I just set my headphones down on my computer desk and walk away.  They go into a semi-low power mode so it doesnt drain much battery anyway.  I usually need to charge these every 2 days or so anyway so it doesnt make a difference if I were to use the case.  I will need to pick up a third party case for traveling though, as I'd be too afraid to have these getting smushed around in my backpack.,Overall though, if you are on the fence for these because of the high price, get them.  They are super high quality, have lots of features, and I believe the build will hold up for many years, especially compared to the plastic headphones most people buy.

  I've been using the Bose 700s for a while now, and I finally decided to give these a try. They are definitely worth the price difference. These sound wayyyy better than the Bose, especially when I'm watching 4K with Dolby vision. I love watching my TV with these. Also, the noise canceling is just on another level from any pair of headphones I've tried. These really block out everything, including the air conditioner units running in my house. The controls are also really easy to use, granted you take the time to read how to use them.,I don't really have any complaints. A lot of people will gripe about the price, but that's Apple for you. You get what you pay for. If you already own a number of Apple products, you'll really benefit from how easy these will integrate into your life. They are exceptionally easy to use with Apple TV. I can switch between listening to my Apple TV, my iPhone, and my MB Pro all in a matter of seconds. I've also had no problem syncing these to third party devices.,Are these large? Yes. They're heavier than the Bose definitely, but I have not had issues with neck pain. I don't find them uncomfortable at all. That's been the most impressive part of the package for me. I figured they'd be intrusive and uncomfortable. But they really aren't. So far, I've had no issue wearing them for 7-8 hours at a time. Years ago, I had the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0s, which caused me neck pain. I was apprehensive that I'd face the same scenario here. Fortunately, I have not had that issue.

  Update 8/21: Eight months later, and I'm still very happy with these.  I use them almost every day.  I think Apple must have improved power management, because I've noticed I don't have to charge them as often as I originally did.,Original review:,These were in very high demand for the first couple of months, but I managed to snag a pair from my local Apple store on launch day.  Honestly, I fully anticipated that I would end up returning these after 30 days, since I didn't expect them to live up to the somewhat high price tag.  When I first played a brief bit of music through them when sitting in the parking lot, that feeling was reinforced, as my initial impression was not great.,However, after getting back home and acclimating my ears to the sound signature, my Bose 700 headphones went up for sale on Ebay the next day.  I'm not an audiophile, so I won't attempt to describe the sound in flowery, embellished terms, but to my ears they sound just about as perfect as you could expect headphones to be.  I listen almost exclusively to classical music, and what I love most about these headphones is that the bass is solid and soothing, but is not obnoxiously overpowering.  The bass is definitely there, but at the same time it doesn't feel like the headphones are ""exerting themselves"" to produce that sound.,Comfort is fine... they do not clamp overly hard on my head, and I prefer the feel of the cloth material rather than sticky vinyl or leather.  I wish Apple had included a way to manually power them off, but in practice this hasn't been a significant issue... I plug them in every 3 days or so.

  Cons:,-The device switching (for apple devices) is not as flawless as I thought it would be and sometimes the headphones get hung up on one device. This is probably fixable by a future software update.,-the headphone ear pieces clack together when they are turned flat, which probably isn’t a big deal, but makes me worry about dings.,Pros:,-7 hours straight listening while wearing glasses, way less ear fatigue than any other over ear headphone I’ve ever used.,-transparency mode is deep magic.,-the spatial audio is so cool.,-it is satisfyingly hardy and I have zero buyer’s remorse.,-noise cancelling is pretty good! Music playing from a speaker nearby can get through it at almost imperceptible levels. For machine hum, fan noise, and constant drones it does incredibly well, it’s a little unreal.,-headband: very comfortable, adjustments are easy and stay put,Neutrals:,-Audio quality is really quite good, but it didn’t blow me away. I still like it a lot, and I prefer the sound of these to the Sony’s-xm4-whatever’s, which a friend let me try .,-weight: they are a little heavy, but I’ve gotten used to it pretty quickly.,-button to switch the noise cancelling mode sometimes requires me to hit it a second time, it has a deeper press which I’m still getting used to.,Overall I love them. Would recommend if you’ve been holding out on other models, use the Apple ecosystem, and plan to own these for a long time like me.

  I laughed at these when I first heard about them but ended up grabbing a pair after seeing there was a 3 month wait (mine shipped early). These are EXPENSIVE but in my opinion worth it. Most top of the line wireless over the ear headphones cost around $399-$499 so there are a tad more. My only complaint is the weird case for them that looks like a lady's bag.,These headphones are beautiful, sleek and pack phenomenal sound. I will still use my air pods more but will use these when I travel or just want to lay on my couch and listen to music.

PeaceBee ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was so excited to get this pair of headset and I have been using it as the only headset (I have multiple) for about a months now. Yes, the sounds is great, but it is not superior to what I have on my Bose QC35. The main charm was that it has Spatial Audio - but wait - there Spatial Audio content is hardly available anywhere. So what does this mean? This means that I paid almost twice the price of an excellent Bose QC 35 noise cancelling headset, with following added DIS-advantages:,1) It is almost twice as heavy, if not more, making it inconvenient to use for longer use.,2) I cannot just turn it off to conserve power; I need to every time place it in the (ugly) case,3) The battery running time is only 20 hours (compared to QC35's 30+ hours) - implying need for frequent charging,4) The primary selling point - Spatial Audio - is worthless since there is hardly any content available for it.,Save yourself a bundle, inconvenience and buyer's remorse. Do more research and get yourself something else.

  Coming from the second gen airpod, these souded a bit better, but not as much as people say. However, one problem I have with mine is that there's a ringing sound in the right airpod everytime there's no music.

  I need a headset of some kind for work. I have to go between sound from a mac, my iPhone and a Dell laptop. I was worried they wouldn’t be compatible and easy to switch. They are! The sound is fantastic. Being able to cancel the noise around me is amazing. I can concentrate on work without looking around to see what’s making a noise. And when just enjoying music or a podcast they can’t be beat. You can get all the Apple guarantees with these as you would if you bought them from an Apple store. They are worth the price.

Brian Landry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have tried so many different wireless earbuds. All had one issue or another.  Here is why I give the Apple Airpod Pro's 5 starts. Sound quality is great. Smooth connection to phone mid call (I don't always have them in when a call comes in). Battery life is great. Earbuds fit comfortably both inside and outside of ear (this has been a huge issue with other wireless buds). The touch element of these earbuds is well placed for answering calls or music on/off (After wearing for a while, I want to adjust them and with other earbuds this would cause me to drop calls or turn on/off music).  Siri reads incoming texts and allows for dictation of outgoing texts.,Love these earbuds!
"
RH13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love these AirPods, sound quality is superior, Active noise canceling works great for a small in ear headphones. Spatial audio future works great, sometimes I forget I have AirPods on, it feels like sound coming directly from my phone, another future I love is automatic on/off, once you put them in your ear AirPods turn on when you take them out turns off automatically., It can also be used as single AirPod, they work independently, It is also very easy to pair and connect, battery lasts as it is advertised and lasts longer if active noice canceling is off. One down side for me is, it doesn’t stays in ears while moving as I was expecting other than that it works and looks great.

MBGH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Best ear buds I have purchased. I finally got tired of buying all the cheap ones and decided to bite the bullet and buy the real deal apple air pods pro and I do not regret it at all. After what I’ve spent on the cheap ones I could have bought these years ago and had 2 more pair with what I invested in the cheap ones. The sound quality is amazing! My husband gets pissed about the noise cancelling technology because he will be trying to talk to me and I don’t hear him 😂😂. Awesome product. I highly recommend!
"
Tom Burke,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ran out of patience while trying to learn how to use the stem controls, and never did get them to work (and I know from reading online comments that I'm far from the only one). Also, I only got a little over five hours of battery life (from a full charge) while listening to music from my iPhone 13 (which was nearby the whole time, in my pocket).,I REALLY like the noise cancellation and passthrough features of the Pro, but otherwise prefer my old Gen 2 AirPods. So, I won't be keeping these.
"
andrew,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First, I would buy this product again but am frustrated with the design of the earpieces that dont allow for a very secure fit. If I am moving around I need to push the pods back into my ears often. I bought after-market retaining pieces and foam ear pieces that fit into the ear which make the pods work for more intense workouts. That being said, they have great sound and decent noise cancellation. I have used them on a couple flights with the stock silicone ear pieces and have been able to listen to music, podcasts, and movies without having the crank the volume past 3/4. Battery life is fine as long as you put them back in the case when done using them. I charge them about every other day.
"
Dom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've always preferred the usability of in-ear earbuds. However, my ear canals are smaller than most people and so any in-canal earbuds hurt after an hour or so of use.,These are the only in-canal earbuds I've ever used that don't leave me in pain afterwards. Something about the plastic is extremely comfortable. I can't really explain it.,I thought spatial audio was going to be a gimmick that would be cool but wouldn't really add anything different to my listening experience. I like to watch football on my computer while I work. Yesterday, I had to restart and decided to watch it on my phone while my computer went through the update cycle.,The spatial audio totally fooled my brain. I actually had to take one of my AirPods out to confirm the sound was coming from them and not my phone. It's like magic.,I've owned 20+ headsets, from Bose to HyperX and everything in between. These are the best I've ever had. I prefer the sound of these over my Razer Nari Ultimate, and I LOVE my Razer Nari Ultimate.,I had planned to return these within a week if they weren't absolutely top-notch. I'm keeping them.

Tim,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  **UPDATE** Second pair was also defective. Same rattling in the left earbud. I'm guessing it came from the same batch since it was ordered so closely together time wise. Sent both pairs back and will be purchasing directly from Apple. The discounted price is nice, but only if the product works as it's supposed to.,Delivered in a timely manner, packaging wasn't damaged and sound quality overall was great. The only issue I have with the product is there is a rattling coming from the left airpod. Happens regardless of the type of music, volume, etc.,In the process of returning the item and getting a replacement. Will update the review depending on if the new ones fix the issue.,I've read in a couple reviews to beware of airpods assembled in Vietnam and those reviews are not lying. My pair was from Vietnam and it had issues. So buyer beware, I'd suggest purchasing straight from Apple if possible.

  UPDATING REVIEW.  YOU can call Apple after the fact and they will add purchase date so Apple Care can be bought over the phone.  No problem.  I bought AirPods new and can't add apple care after purchase without taking the AirPods to an apple store for assessment which is very inconvenient.  Waited to purchase Apple Care until I received them to see if I would like them.  Well within 30 days of purchase.  Suggest you buy Apple CAre at time of purchase through Amazon, rather than waiting.
"
Skip Stone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I would have loved to keep these but they would not fit in my ear canals. I had to return them. The large tips were to small making the noise canceling ineffective. I had to go with Sony XM4 earbuds because I could get aftermarket SpinFit tips. This combination works great. No one makes a good XL tip for the Apple earbuds. If Apple is going to have a proprietary tip attachment design, they should at least offer an XL and an XS size tip, even if they are an expensive added accessory.
"
PK,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pros: Great construction, color choices, material build, sound quality, ANC, seamless connection to the Apple devices,Cons: Heavy so will be difficult to carry on the head for a long time; specially if traveling a lot. No connection to the airplane systems (additional money spent); the mesh is great looking but will break with travel.  Price is too high to justify. Approx range could have been $300; for the additional 249 you get the Apple Brand, Logo. No case to carry; that case is useless.,Recommendation:  Wait for the AirPods Max version 2. They will reduce the price and provide a better value and case.
"
SpeedingCheetah,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Do NOT buy these if you want to use them on your Apple TV or iPhone to watch streaming movies or shows. They do not get loud enough.,Any audio source with multi-channel audio, on max volume, is barely loud enough to hear even in a dead silent room. Have to focus more than natural to hear anything.,I had hopped Apples own headphone product  would do better with volume than my other full sized headphones, Skull Candy Crusher Evo, when it comes to streaming apps, but nope, these are less volume.,They do get loud for Apple music, and 2.0 audio no problem. But overall, they are lower volume than most other headphones i have used. Same results when using my iPhone 12 PM with the same streaming apps.,Sound:,Very disappointing.  I am baffled as to all the glorious reviews, even audiophiles generally surprised and praise these. They all must be tone deaf or brainwashed by Apple or being paid by Apple to give them such a good review. I have used $20 Walmart no name random endcap headphones that sound about where these are, just average, certainly not $500+ quality.,Not exactly flat sound, it is a U shaped sound with the highs raised and the low sub bass raised.,But everything in the center sounds just cheap and tad tiny, lacking any vibrance or sound stage.,Narrow sound stage.,Sure sound is extremally subjective, I prefer lots of deep bass clear mids and highs, with a wide soundstage. These are nothing like that. They have very little bass. There are tiny hints of some very low volume low sub bass, but only appears when the song is bass heavy. They are nothing compared to the bass that the SkullCandy Crusher Evo has when using its Haptic Bass, or the Vmoda Crossfade Wireless (when u use a EQ since they are tuned to be mostly flat stock). There is no way to natively EQ these Apple headphones.,""Spatial Audio"" is a super gimmick.,Take a metal can of Jimmy's  Baked Beans, cut the 2 ends out of the can, and stick one end over your ear, the other stick the headphone on it, that is how it sounds. Like listening to something in a tin can. Super tiny, echoey and just awful.,Design/Build Quality:,SUPER!  This is what you are buying. A super high quality metal product that is more work of fine art than a  product that gives you good audio experience.  So much a work of art and fashion, there is no power button.,Comfort:,This is where I have to give these 6 stars.  They are surprisingly comfortable. They are the heaviest weight headphones in my collection, yet they feel the lightest on my head.,My SkullCandy Crusher Evo, have stronger clamp force, the headband aggravates the top of my head, and my ears get very hot and sting after 15 min or so of use. But they have amazing sound, head rattling bass and sound like a full Home Theater system with 2 large subs.,But, I wanted something more comfortable so that i can watch long movies or shows late night when i don't so much care about having the Home Theater experience.,It is truly too bad these Apple headphones do not get loud enough to be useable for such, cause they are so comfortable, i would be able to wear them for hours and barely feel them.,Noise Cancel:,I do not nor ever cared for Nosie Cancel tech in full sized headphones, as i use them at home in a quite room. (The only use case I have for Nosie Cancel is at work, but i use earbuds there, for pocket abilty and convenience. The AirPods Pro earbuds do a good job of canceling out the noise of a warehouse when i want them too, and transparency is good for when I am around the office area and need to hear my co-workers, but still want to listen to my pods casts. I do not listen to music at work, so i do not care that the AirPods Pro sound like crap for music.),The AirPods Max ANC is very good far as I can tell. It will eliminate the noise of a fan on in the room, even a AC unit. Many say it is the best ANC they have used, even compared to Bose and Sony...i can not really comment on that, since i have needed ANC and thus, have very little experience with it.,When neighbor is mowing the lawn, or when crying babies or kids are out playing and there is noise i want to mute, I guess I can throw these on and make my world quite again.,The case:,It sure is....unique. It is fine for me, since they will just sit on a bookshelf, but for sure, useless as a real case and even more useless if you intend to travel. For sure, go buy a aftermarket hard case online.,Other:,Uses lightening cable. But that's Apple for ya.,Have to buy a $35  3.5mm jack to Lightening cable  to use wired, and has to be that or special designed cable meant for these, since it needs to be bi-directional. Or the inverse of most cables. U need one that converts and sends the signal from analog jack to digital Lightening, 99% of ""Lightning to 3.5mm"" cables /adapters work the standard way (digital Lightning to 3.5mm analog). And I tried a Apple lightning to lightning cable, and that does not trigger wired mode.,Overall, overpriced, typical Apple product. Yes, I use Apple products, but not just Apple. I use daily Apple and Google and Windows products and ecosystems.,If you are wanting good sounding headphones, look elsewhere.,Are you wanting a set of Apple built full sized headphones that put out sound, then you will be happy with them.,At least, since they are nice metal cans on your head, if you are out for a walk, and get mugged, u can use them as a defensive weapon and bean your attacker over they head with them. Bonk! They would hurt.

D. Brodsky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I appreciate good sound.  I have a pair of $5K Bowers & Wilkins speakers.  I subscribe to Tidal and Qobuz High Def music steaming services.  My other headphones are Sonys that are always rated number 1,  Bowers & Wilkins PX and of course Bose QC35II.  At first when I listened to Apple Max at Apple store I did not like what I was hearing, but after I’ve watched some professional reviews on YouTube from people who know what they are talking about, I picked up a pair.  I went through the pain of ordering the Apple cable since that’s the only one that works actually works with DAC.  Once I plugged it into my  Dragonfly Audioquest Red, and started listening to high def masters on Tidal, I was quickly wowed by the sound quality.  The soundstage is great, the sound is very balanced, bass is tight and punchy.  If I could describe the sound with one word, it would be ‘luxurious”.  If you just use these via Bluetooth,  you are denying yourself the reason for buying these.  Via Bluetooth, the sound difference between these and the other headphones is not that pronounced, because, it is Bluetooth protocol that kills all the goodness in sound transferring.  You need to use these plugged in and use a good quality DAC if you are coming from Iphone to unlock higher definition.  When plugged in,  I will rank my headphones:  Apple - 1st,  Sony - 2d,  B&W - 3d and Bose QC35II - last.  However Bose is the most confortable to wear for hours.  Sony is the second most comfortable, Apple is third and B&W are least comfortable.  B&W has incredible soundstage (it is like you are there) and some instruments sound incredible, but it is so uncomfortable it is like torture for my ears.,So the bottom line if you just want to go Bluetooth and don’t care about high def music - Sony is the best bet (2021 1000XM4 model but 2019 1000XM3 model is very close too and 2019 model had APTX chip and the 2001 model does not),  but if you are willing to go an extra step to appreciate fine sound, these Apple AirPods Max are the best.

Canaan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received these as a gift, in other words, price cannot be taken into account. I received these in Salmon color. I use them everyday on an android device and on a mac based OS device. I own the Sony 1000XM4,Based on my experience in ears solution like the Shure, some over ears AKG experience and some brief encounter with ribbon speakers on 10K+ amp, I would say the first limit of these headphones are the Bluetooth protocol itself. In that regard, the only way to extract the acoustic quality of these is to use the $40 cable.,Ergonomics, the headphones distribute their weight evenly across a stretch mesh fabric. Clever design. The friction required to extend the arms of the headphones is high enough that you will not have to recalibrate the length across time. The buttons have a great feedbacks, and I bought translucent protectors to protect the anodized finish of the shells. The ear cushions are comfortable, even for glass wearer. However, its design forces you to put them back correctly straightforward other wise the head detection system will not work (you can see that the hole does not align when cushion is upside down L-R down instead of up).,What a great segway to bring this important point. This is a not perfect product in its design and integration, from the unacceptable case form and functions, to the headphones poor battery autonomy, to the threat of having the humidity of the head getes into the speakers (read the forum, I think this is true), I got to say, you may have to shell another $50 for the apple care.,Having said all that, from a person being on android, I would go for these. The overall experience and acoustic, reminds me a bit of the third gen ipad, imperfect, but who cares.,Between these and the Sony 1000XM4, even on an Android and the 2/3 the battery life, I would go for Apple one. Better built, better sound, better ergonomics. If you have holes in your pocket go for it and go for the apple care, you won't regret it.

  I love music!  Saying that, when the percussionist in the symphony taps the triangle, I want to hear it.  I have tried cheap and expensive headphones and finally, I have a pair and I can hear all the sounds.  These are just amazing.  Long battery life and the highest quality I have found.  Now what I don't like:  #1:  The cost, these are expensive but I finally have what I need, #2:  The weight, I think these are a little heavy.  They are made with quality material but are not light.,All in all, the best I have used.  I bought blue and the cushions on the headphones can be changed.  They are magnetic and you can purchase separate colors.  With the return policy, what do you have to lose?  You will be amazed at Amazon Music HD or Tidal since they have the best streaming rate.  Enjoy!!!

  After listening to my husband ask repeatedly “What do you want for Christmas?” I finally gave in and confessed I had my eye on these AirPods Max. (I bought them at the big box store). I am Blown Away, let me tell you. They are by far THE BEST headphones I’ve ever owned. YES, they are expensive. I rarely buy anything for myself preferring to spend my money on the kids/grandkids. I guess that is how I justify buying them for myself.,The sound is so rich and clear. I hear parts of a song I never heard before. Wow. They are a bit heavy but I like them that way. I don’t see myself wearing them for more than an hour or two at a time. I love the way that they fit. They perfectly fit over my head.,They paired perfectly with my iPhone. Just a few taps and even a Grandma like me is up and running. The case is even a lot more substantial than I thought and gets the job of protecting the Headphones done nicely. These are my “at home” headphones. When I want to relax and kick back. I ended up getting the Space Grey color. I’d recommend going to a local store just to try them out and see for yourself whether they are worth the price tag. For me they are worth it.

Sabir,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pros- These headphones sound amazing, I've tried Bose 700's Sony wh100xm3's and xm4's and still, these headphones had better sound quality than both. the bass response is incredible, its prominent yet not muddy. the mids and highs are crisp yet not overpowering. when you first get the headphones they don't really sound that good but then you go to headphone accommodations and do the custom audio setup then they sound amazing. also the transparency mode is better than i ever thought, people in youtube videos raved about it but when i tried it, it was mind blowing i could actually sustain a conversation with it, and the noise canceling was also amazing.,Cons- doesn't come with a case, the included bra is useless, I also wish it came with an audio cable and and a charging brick. its also a bit heavy and the clamping force is off, it squeezes more at the top a considerable amount.,Summary- if you have a decent amount of money to spend, have an iPhone, and really care about audio quality then buy these headphones, if you plan to use these with a pc then don't bother, I had issues with Bluetooth that made these un-usable.
"
S. Brown,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very good build quality. Sound is great but not better than what you'd find elsewhere for $100 - 150 cheaper.,Everyone compares these to Bose or Sony (which they don't compare to) when at this price we should be comparing to Master & Dynamic MW65 or one of the Sennheiser PXC 550 or Momentum 3's to which - Apple falls severely short in every single area.,So with these you're paying about $250 for a name and ""Cool factor"" but not for quality.,For $500 I expect the best out and they aren't even in the top 5!
"
RR,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased these directly from Apple.  It took months to deliver, and during the interim I thought many times about canceling the order.  Why? Well, the first thing is it worth the astronomical cost, and especially when compared to a benchmark set such as the Sony WH-XB900N/B ($248 on good ole Amazon)?  The answer is a definitive ""No!""  The Apple AirPods Max are grossly over priced.  Any intelligent buyer would want to compare the ""specs.""  For instance, what are the frequency response, THD, etc. that virtually every high-end pair of headphones provide.  Apple supplies no specs and when I asked Customer Service for them for comparative reasons, I was told that they weren't available. The only comparison is therefore subjective. The AirPods Max came well packaged - an Apple hallmark.  Instructions were not only scant, but written in a faint gray color and in a font size that even an eagle would have challenges discerning. The controls for adjusting the tonal qualities are absent too.  The ear cushions are very comfortable, but after about 30 minutes become very warm.  The headphone are also among the heaviest due to their metal construction, which give a solid feel. The mesh headband is also innovative and very comfortable.  Coupled with the right and left adjustments, they are a pleasure to wear for extended periods.  A variety of colors are offered too, but I went with the space gray and later ordered the red cushions ($69), and yes the price includes both right and left cushions as the Apple ad is vague on that matter.  Overall sound reproduction is above average, but not stellar. The Sennheiser Momentum 3 headphones, in my opinion, are far better as are the Sony XB900, and they are significantly less expensive.  The battery life is very good thus far and has approached 17 hours before needing to be re-charged.  Apple advertises 20 hours. Part of Apple's promo is free engraving on the AirPods Max, which I requested.  They arrived sans engraving.  Customer Service informed me that it was apparently a common error, and offered to provide a full refund or replacement.  I asked about the replacement's delivery. It would be another couple of months. Ridiculous, and shame on Apple for its inferior quality control, but it's par for the course as previous engravings have also been neglected rendering the whole promo a joke - on me unfortunately. So, do I recommend the AirPods Max?  If comfort is your primary consideration, then yes.  If sound quality is your primary consideration, then no. If you need headphones quickly, then it is even more of a headache, and don't even bother with the free engraving.,Update After Three Weeks,The headphones have performed well and reproduce virtually all of my music with great fidelity.  The battery still doesn't last as long as claimed by Apple, but the condensation issues that others have reported have not been experienced even after several hours of wear.  They do, unfortunately, make your ears very warm.  The major problem, and successfully resolved by a very capable Apple Support Member, was a failure to re-connect after charging. The reason(s) is still unclear, but after charging the headphones were totally ""dead."" The factory re-set was attempted three times unsuccessfully.  After re-starting all (Mac) devices with current OS systems, verifying Bluetooth connections, etc. the AirPods Max seemed doomed to a factory repair while still under warranty.  I then re-connected them to the Apple charger and the green indicator light appeared - a good sign! I then paired the headphones again with all devices and they regained functionality at 100% charged.  The Apple Support Member and I were both surprised and relived.  At least, I established a logged case and reported malfunction should it happen again.  Bottom line - for the exorbitant cost one would expect better quality control.  My opinion is that the AirPods Max were rushed to production in efforts to meet a high demand and quality suffered.,And a rumor among others that strong magnetic fields can effect a shutdown will be followed up on later, and after mine pass through airport luggage scanners, loose connection near microwaves, etc.

  But it’s worth it!  I got it at the Apple Store but it’s actually cheaper here.  I got the green ones but really want it in purple but doesn’t exist!  I listen back and forth between these and Beats Powerbeats Pro and the latter sound like mini mono speakers compare to these.  Firstly, $500 is nothing because I paid $5000 for audiophile headphones but you don’t really need such headphones.  Not practical.  They are wired and open cased so you can’t use them in a plane and you’ll disturb other ppl.  They don’t leak sound but actually acting like speakers!  If that’s not bad enough, you’ll need to plug them into a DAC with a power source.  Did you actually think your tiny MP3 player or phone will power such headphones?  Also gonna be hard for iPhone and Apple users with no jack output.  Lastly, mp3 format is extremely lossy format and not as good as CD or wav files but wav files are huge!  Can you even buy music in wav format?  My point is just get these, it’s beautiful, practical, no wires, and perfect for regular listeners of mp3.  Ariana Grande sounds a beautiful song bird with these headphones.

"
John Doe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Definitely worth if you’re looking for open earbuds. Sound quality is solid, size is compact, and the bass is very punchy in quiet environments. However, I ended up returning it because my right ear hurt too much. I was actually quite upset about this because AirPods Pro and previous AirPods fit nicely in my ears.
"
Nicole,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound is great but I can’t wear them for long periods of time without my ears hurting. And head tracked Spacial Audio is a gimmick your never gonna use. If you don’t care if earbuds have a cable or not, get a pair of KZ ZSN Pro X/ ES4 or KBear KS1’s.

  Received used AirPod pros with the former owner’s Apple ID still connected to the AirPods. The noise cancelling did not work, nor did the transparency mode because I kept hearing a clicking noise when either of those modes were turned on and it was not my music. Don’t buy Apple products from Amazon unless you want fake and used products.
"
Amazon Customer1,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The right airpod had some sort of popping sound in noise cancelation and a hissing popping sound in transparency, I don’t blame the manufacturing of apple but the ones of Amazon because now I know this crap is secondhand or refurbished hence the price drop and I’m never going to get AirPods from Amazon again!!! Who ever is reading this comment should know two facts, one the products are definitely 100% secondhand/refurbished and two, the product will become faulty at any time and is not worth purchasing at Amazon.
"
Ernest,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Wanted for long time, waited for $ drop then sale price, still pricey compared to no name. Quality build, easy connection from iPhone to MacBook Pro and back. Like how both AirPod and cases  battery charge state is shown on iPhone, Sound is rather good for its size, noise canceling function  can only be as good as fit of each ear. They do “loosen” and come off white activity like  bending over/bike riding, so I “reset” them in each ear when they feel loose. Careful while in the WC.

  Apple has outdone themselves. These AirPod pros have great sound quality, are super light, and very comfortable. If they have a weakness I would say it is th noise cancellation. I really don’t notice a big difference when I toggle it on and off. That said, With a good seal they are naturally noise canceling.
"
Raging45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am upgrading from the first gen AirPods, which didn’t fit my ear well, they had a tendency to fall out. With these, that won’t be an issue! So far I am extremely happy with my purchase! Others claim that there is an issue with these products that are produced in Vietnam, but that isn’t the case mine. The active noise canceling is absolutely amazing, I wore these while vacuuming and could barely hear the vacuum at all! I love my AirPods and wouldn’t hesitate to purchase again!
"
gary,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've never been one for apple products other than the iPhone. However these are a game changed. In addition to some absolutely insanely impressive sound, the noice cancellation will have you questioning your own sanity. I have many other earbud / headphone sets with ""noice cancellation"" but these blow my mind. Finally the last touch that I love is the ""transparency mode"" which allows you to have normal conversation and hear everything as if you have no headphones in at all.
"
Levi Leeder,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like to take walks, and I often workout at a very loud gym, the voice canceling software is great, it mutes out the noice at the gym, I have not yet tried running in them, and I’m not sure if they will stay in place in my ear while running, but when it comes to lifting weights they are perfect.,They can respond to text messages and that has voided some issues because it will try and send a message to someone while I am having a conversation with someone else, but I just try and be cautious about it.
"
Dani,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased a set of these for my son for Christmas.  He tried for an hour or so to pair with his iPad.  When he finally got them paired, the left AirPod would not work.  He put them back in the charing case and it was at 80% charge.  After an hour he checked and the right AirPod was at 100% while the left was at 0%.  We tried putting these in another charging case with the same results.  In the end, we returned this set and a waiting for a replacement order to arrive.

Usually one charge of the case lasts me a few days of while I use them at work. The sound quality is crisp and clear and the surround sound with the noise cancellation almost like they’re right there next to you kind of clear. Best earbuds I’ve ever owned and I definitely think it was worth the investment.

Right when you put them on, with no sound you can feel the noise cancellation. They are truly worth the price. I use them when i go to the gym and workout. I put them on and “ Its On Like Donkey Kong” i get into my zone and its me against me with my Airpods to keep me focused. If you were wondering. I WIN EVERYTIME👍🏼

  excellent at blocking out noise when on phone calls. the listener could hear me in what must have been 80-90 decibel noise - I was walking by a v.loud construction site, apologized for the noise, and the listener said they could hear me perfectly and had no idea what noise I was talking about. blew me away, that's never happened before [I regularly use and love my Jabras, Sonys and Sures].,uncanny 'spatial' audio. every third time I wear them [in the evenings when my home is asleep], I literally take the airpods off to check if the audio is filling the room or its just in my ears.,normally critical of Apple products, the airpod pros have blown me away.,note that I bought 3rd party 'memory foam' ear inserts 20ish bucks for 3 of the same size to make them fit properly. now they don't fall out.
"
E.Gonzalez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These were a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He's a chef and the cord to his old headphones were getting in the way. He absolutely LOVES the AirPod Pros but unfortunately he can't use them while at work. The noise cancellation works too good to the point where he can't hear anything the people around him are saying. The goal was to get him better earphones to help make a more pleasant work day, not get him fired. Haha. But hands down, they were a great purchase!
"

"
Ernest Boyd,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Simple, intuitive setup and surprisingly good sound quality and construction.  Battery life isn't fantastic, but it's okay with case recharging. Beware that the batteries are not replaceable and pods will be trash after they die. Could be a few years but who knows., I cancelled the order because Amazon changed delivery date. However, I bought them $10 less than Amazon's $179 sale price from another retailer. AirPod Pros are very much worth buying from Amazon, though.

  Pricey, as usual from apple.,MagSafe or corded charging.,Very nice integration to Mac and iPhones.,Supports “find my device”.,Very comfortable.,Great sound.,Should include some kind of ear hooks or safety cord/strap, at that price.,I wish they came in black or other colors, but knowing Apple, that option would be $50 extra 😩

  I gave the AirPods Pro as a gift today and when we tried to connect it, the Noise Cancellation doesn’t turn on in the Bluetooth settings. We updated the iPhone, made sure everything is fully charged, placed both headphones and still nothing. It would just stay at “Off” or “Transparency”. What’s going on!
"
Val Pizarro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods are very comfortable and easy to use.  I love how easily it connects to different devices (iPad, laptop, phone) What I love most is the noise canceling feature. I can now sit in the living room while my husband watch his shows on TV and I can focus on what I am studying without interruption when I use the noise cancelling feature.  It works extremely well!! The sound is crystal clear when I listen to music or talk on the phone, even when I’m not close to my phone.

  My guess is most of the reviewers had them not long before they gave them 5 stars. I hate them. They are constantly a struggle to connect to my iPhone 12. They are always waving flags on my screen telling me where they are. They are always asking me to use Siri and to use Apple music. Yet they won't connect. I hate them. They are more of a malware than a listening device. When you can get them to work, the sound is great. I have to turn my desktop off when using them or they start playing iMusic from my PC when I am 2 floors away trying to use the phone playlist, I hate them.
"
B. Menke,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Another winner from Apple. Are these headphones expensive, yes. Are they worth it, yes! These are the best sounding bluetooth headphones I have ever heard. First off, the noise cancelling is amazing! It doesn't shut out every noise, but close to it. Then press the button on the headphones and you can hear everything around you. Like your not even wearing them. This is great if someone is talking to you while wearing them. The sound quality is really very good. Listening to music (depending on the recording) I can hear instruments I have never heard before in a song. Everything is clear and the boosted bass is a welcome addition. The bass is not too heavy, it seems just right. I really enjoy listening to them. The battery last for days/weeks if you keep them in the case. The one downside (the case) it's ugly. I bought a case on Amazon that works just as well and looks a lot better. Long and short of it, the Airpod Max's don't do anything perfect. However, they do everything really well! Disclaimer: I bought mine through Apple, not Amazon.
"
elnadav12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've seen reviews online saying it's similar in sound quality to the Bose QC35 II, but damn, It's not even close.,After daily driving the QC35 for 3 years, I could tell immediately that the sound is clearer and less distorted. The AirPods Max complimented many genres of music, from rock and pop by AC DC, Coldplay, Maroon 5 and modern house music by David Guetta and Oliver Heldens. Bass punches harder while vocals stay as sharp as a razor. The sound is deeper with more vibrance and contrast.,Noise cancelling is way better than the QC35 and even better than the new XM4 by Sony. Transparency mode is incredible and way ahead of the competition - even better than the AirPods Pro.,My only 2 complaints - the stupid Smart case and the weight. They are less comfortable than the Bose. If you're looking for something to wear on a long flight go for the Bose or AirPods Pro. I'm very sensitive to clamping pressure and it's quite strong. The case - built from nice ""fake"" leather but absolutely no protection. Throw it away and buy a replacement from Amazon.,P.S. I haven't tried the THX panda, but they miss too much features in my opinion.
"
Star,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  There are pro's and con's.  on the pro side, the sound is ok.  it's not $1000 nice but it's better than the cheapy airpods.,On the con side, bluetooth is still terrible.  The microphone in meetings is terrible.  it's either off - you cannot hear yourself at all or all the noise in the back ground is amplified significantly and you can hear everything!  there is no between - it sucks.  You either feel you are under water and yelling (hoping others can hear you) or you turn off noise cancellation and you hear EVERYTHING amplified.,How about noise cancellation and hearing your own voice?!
"
Zach,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As everyone has stated, battery life isn’t the best but if you are reasonable with your usage and charge frequent it’s not an issue. For me, these will hardly leave the house unless I’m flying. I like to enjoy, primarily, music (often after a few drinks) or to watch YouTube videos in bed.,The audio is very clean and adds a lot of depth and separation to the mix. Unlike other headphones, it doesn’t feel like it is leaning bass heavy or boosted in vocal range (2,000-4,000hz) and I would not at all say these are “tinny” in fact the upper frequencies feel great and the overall sound is balanced.,I had did have to return my first pair to repurchase at a lower price (it went on sale $50 less than a week after I bought them!) and my first pair maybe fit a little better? Not sure if that’s placebo or what- but had I not had that pair I wouldn’t notice or say that they don’t fit great, because they do. My new pair just feels a little more loose.,If you enjoy listening to music regularly, and I mean really enjoy it, then these are for you. I wouldn’t sell my kidney for these, but a couple days worth of hard-work? These are definitely worth that imo. I plan to get the cable to hardline them for even better sound in the future. Maybe around Black Friday or cyber Monday?
"
swq,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had headphones since cassette walkman age. And by no means i am some ‘audiophile’. However I have owned plenty of noise cancelling headphones over the years. These by far are the best if you need exceptional sound quality and sound stage. I use Spotify to stream all my music, and I just enjoy every time I put them on. When you open the box, you would instantly recognize the built quality is top notch and attention to detail is second to none. Noise cancelling is very effective, along with Spatial audio which makes movies and music more entertaining and engaging. Gone is the ‘swipe gesture’ stuff on ear cups. The digital crown works effortlessly.,Also about the case: I totally love it. Its elegant, and functional. And very easy to slide the pods once listening is over. No need to buy a third party ‘Bose’ style suitcase.,Ignore those often funny ‘expert’ YouTube reviews. Most of them are pretentious folks attempting to appear ‘audiophiles’
"
cluigi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you are already in the Apple ecosystem this is a no brainier. The set up, noise cancellation, acoustic fidelity, & note with spatial audio support - honestly nothing compares to them under $700. I’m a bit of a audio headphone collector, it’s a bad and costly habit seeking sonic clarity and fidelity all the time. Such as it is … I’m very impressed with these I compare them favorably with those units costing 2x their price. The controls are like all things Apple intuitive and easy to access. Just smart design throughout. As I said at the outset, if you are using an Apple device already and in the market for a top of the line over the ear headphone under $500 which performs like studio units more than twice their cost - look no further.
"
Adamchristopher,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Im honestly not sure what to think about these. The sound is good for wireless headphones, although I really wasn’t blown away by it. I think I’ve realized that I just don’t care for the sound wireless headphones produce. I much prefer my AT-M50s (wired) to these, and they’re only $150. The sound level is awful. These are pretty quiet. Granted, I have damaged my ears from years of concert going and loud music, but I don’t like having Apple decide what my max volume should be. The construction on the AirPods Max is stellar, but the fact that the only way to turn these off and save battery is to use the strange little case is a bizarre design move im not a fan of. I don’t use the ANC cancelling much because it makes my head feel weird but it’s good. These sound better than the AirPods Pro, but if I need to listen to something on the go im grabbing them over these. I don’t quite know what Apple was going for but I wish they would have just gone full on and made these wired and made these sound like $500 audiophile headphones.
"
JV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Products works flawlessly if you are into the Apple ecosystem, changing between Apple product is a breeze with them and you don’t have to click on anything they will automatically connect to all your apple devices. They are a bit heavy (I have been a BOSE QC25/35) user so I’m still getting use to the weight but you don’t feel it in your head surprisingly. The noise cancelling function is better than BOSE but can’t say that is justifiable to pay over 100 over the BOSE but if you’re practical and care more about integrating then is ok.,If anything negative will be the overall size they take even when putting on backpack they take a lot of space.
"

  the sound quality of this airpods not worth it the almost 500 houndred dollars you pay. the noise cancelation is great and the transparent mode too, but the airpods put too much,Pressure in your head to the fact that your ears star to feel pain!! the airpods are very heavy when you use them. I think the worst is the sound quality and the price. I have a TOZO T12 Wireless Earbuds that cost 29.99 and the sound is better than the airpods max!!!! please I buy this airpods for you to tell you and warn you that is not worth it the purchased you will regret it.

  These AirPods are great but have some room for improvements. Since these AirPods are universal fit, they should be okay for all ear types. For me, they keep falling off and doesn't set in place.

  This is the best consumer noise canceling headphone out there, but NOT worth the insane price. It does everything beautifully but there are obvious problems with the product that either showed a lack of care from apple or a rushed product.,Pro’s,1. Best noise cancellation against competitors,2. Sound quality is arguably more tight with fuller and richer and sound,3. Beautifully crafted,4. Apple integration is seamless,Con’s,1. Price price price. for 200-250$ more than competitors, there is NOT A 250$ enhancement in the headphones themselves.,2. Scratchy ear cups. They use acrylate as a gluing product and the ear cups are very itchy when wearing them. They took a while to break in and still feel itchy when i grow a beard.,3. No case. The flimsy “bra” case is the saddest excuse for a headphone case that I’ve ever seen. This thing truly SUCKS.,4. Not easy to use with non apple products. Plain and simple. Integration is not great,I cannot recommend this product. Am i happy with them? Yes, but not 550$ worth of happy with them. Wait for a sale or gen-2. They’ll last for a long time but i find it ridiculous that i have to shell out extra money for protein leather earcups and an actual headphones case. Disappointed in what I got for the money, not necessarily the product itself.

  These headphones are great in every area except for the dumb case and this major engineering flaw that ruins the headphones when they are used. If you use these headphones for long sessions then condensation will build up and destroy them.,I have had these headphones replaced by apple 3 times now all of them died because of condensation. They won’t refund them but they will continue to send you replacements to the end of time.,If you only use headphones for short sessions then they might work for you but they will die on you if you use them for longer sessions daily.,Don’t buy them if you want to use them for more than an hour or two a day.,Worst apple product I have ever owned.

  I bought these mainly because my previous pair (Beoplay H9) was difficult to connect (it sometimes required several attempts) and could not connect to more than one device at the same time. I expected the famous Apple system integration and hoped for better noise cancellation and sound quality. It is only with noise cancellation that I am truly satisfied. The Beoplays were not exceptional in that department but while I have no direct comparison to the Bose or Sony competitors, I can easily believe AirPods Max are up there with the very best. Also, the transparency mode really is excellent. I understand that someone switching from the Sonys or Boses can appreciate the higher quality of the materials, etc., but the Beoplays were certainly not cheaply made, the ear cushions were leather and the whole headphone (despite using metal!) much lighter.  I expected more from the sound. Again, maybe this is because people underestimate the Beoplays (and compared to Sony MX4 or Bose 700 there may be a significant difference), but when compared to my almost 4-year old H9s I could not see any drastic improvement. The sound is a bit more spacious (the soundstage wider), but that's about it. I definitely did not have the experience of hearing my favourite tracks anew (something I felt when switching from Bose Q35 to the Beoplays). What is most surprising is how poor the vaunted Apple integration is. Yes, they are easy to pair for the first time, but let’s be honest. You only do it once. Then it gets worse.  The Airpods may be laying on my desk (ostensibly not in use). Someone calls me on my iPhone. Even though they are not on my head, the call gets redirected to the Airpods. I have to manually override this and return it to the iPhone. The same happens when I am the one making the call. The automatic pairing could be disabled, but then what would be the difference to a third-party product? When I am using my MacBook Pro and putting the headphones on, they rarely connect automatically. I have to click to connect. Not only, then, is the “integration” and automatic switching moderately useful. At times it is simply infuriating (a few minutes before writing this  was trying to answer a call in the kitchen, the phones were on my desk in another room and the call went to the Airpods!).  I can only hope software updates are coming.

  Truly incredible sound, if you want to be an audiophile,  it you’re too lazy to research and set up gear this is a nice compromise for amazing sound with minimal effort. They’re best for when you really want to enjoy the music or audio. Best for when it really matters. I still use my regular AirPod pros for working out and phone calls as they’re much much more comfortable, but the audio is incomparable.,I don’t think it’s the best sound ever. There’s probably other headphones that are better but it’s the best I’ve ever heard and the Apple experience is as easy and seamless as always.,Luxury? Yup. Worth it if you care about sound? Yes.
"
Rebecca Monroe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No lightning cable (yes these us lightning) or aux cord included but whatever. These are easily some of the best sounding and feeling headphones I've ever worn. While they are comfortable, they are made out of metal so they are heavier than most headphones so if you wear them for too long you can really start to feel the wight, additionally since the ear cups are attached magnetically you can remove and replace them quite easily. They sound really nice and are awesome for spacial audio and both noise cancellation and transparency mode are incredible. They have nice controls (I just LOVE spinning the digital crown) which consist of a digital crown for volume that you press and hold for siri and a separate button similar to the volume buttons on your phone which is used to switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode as well as skipping and reversing songs. My only real bone to pick with these is the stupid carrying case. It is ugly and annoying, as it is the only way to get the headphones to turn off without manually turning them off in settings. in addition it does not protect the headphones at all and the magnet that holds it shut is kind of loose, furthermore, when you take the headphones out, the ear cups clack together which can cause light damage to them down the road. However, an easy fix is to just buy a different third party case that can turn them off and is just better in basically every way. Thank you for reading, and I hope that this was at least somewhat helpful.

  I bought these to replace my Sennheiser Momentum headphones which do not have a mute button and was really disappointed to find out the apple ones do not have a mute button and you can't configure the buttons to perform mute function.,Music quality is worse than the Sennheiser Momentum and skype/zoom calls are bettter on the Sennheiser Momentum - the apples headphones almost sound like they are not full duplex in a call - similar to bose quite comfort and most lower quality headphones on the market.

jacob perkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These were my first noise canceling pair of headphones. I wanted something to use in the mornings while I edit video while everyone else is asleep and I absolutely love these headphones. I bought them their all time high and I don’t regret the purchase at all. Great headphones for that killer listening experience. I have AirPods too and each has its own function. If you want something for leisure listening these are a pair I recommend if you have the budget for it.
"
ALASTAIR McNEILLIE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The first time I turned on the noise cancellation feature when i was in my living room, the only thing I could hear was my heartbeat (which was honestly unnerving at first.) The noise cancellation and the comfort are the two places that I feel like these headphones shine. The audio is great, but falls behind my other pair of headphones, the Sony XM4’s, once you use the equalizer feature that only sony offers. If you are going to be using your headphones for a long time in a noisy environment, these are probably your best bet. Is it worth the hundreds of extra dollars for the improvements over the competition? Thats up to you, and I’m not even sure of that myself.
"
John Adams,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is in a league of its own. No other headphones have as good noise cancellation as these.,The bass is on the weaker side but enough to enjoy your music.,Downsides is that these headphones are too heavy. The weight paired with the earpad's material makes them very uncomfortable. The ear pads kept rubbing the skin around my ears and my skin was irritated.,If they were much lighter in weight and the ear pads were softer then I would have kept them. I had to return them.

  ..Unless you are a “pro” user utilizing high level software. I’m loving this model and don’t even feel like I’m missing out on Touch ID. But I’m not a fan of the Magic Mouse.. would’ve preferred if Amazon offered a Magic Trackpad upgrade like on the apple website for $50 but otherwise this was a great investment for the value.,For folks in need of a desktop/family computer but who are also working in areas where space is constrained- this is an ideal  all in one package for you. I already feel attached to this mighty yet sleek piece of tech due to all the personalized color details and quick performance. No apple product is perfect but this one is certainly once in a generation type of hype after over a decade since the last iMac design update.,**Update** After a few days getting used to the machine I love it even more! I’m surprised by the great selection of games compatible on the gorgeous Retina display. I did have to buy a cheap backlit keyboard for night work and hope for apple to upgrade their next magic keyboard with backlit keys…

Matt Eye,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This iMac is a cheaper alternative to the more meaningful likes of the original iMac and iMac Pro, but there are drawbacks. Most of the ports are available on the back, and the speakers are about as good as iPhone 12 Pro Max, which are quite good for an iMac this compact. However, the M1 chip is focused on VR and AR, not performance. Intel is an industry standard, M1 is new and still relatively unknown to the industry. Mac OS is too hoggy on resources, and doing any kind of simple task is as good as you can do. Photoshop, video editing, gaming, etc. You need 32 GB or more of memory (RAM) to do such work reliably, as just running the system alone uses half the memory. You can hardly run Mac OS at all on 8 GB. The system is showing a few hundred MB available just after booting the system. Yes, the display looks great, but the webcam is average, about the quality from the fourth generation iPod Touch or second generation iPad from late 2010. Just go back to the Intel processor and offer up to 128 GB of memory so that this can do something productive. This new M1 iMac just looks like eye candy only slightly better than a Chromebook. I don't recommend this product unless you do the most basic of tasks or do light productivity on 16 GB of memory, which is no longer enough for any Apple computer running Mac OS in 2021. Too bad, you cannot use Boot Camp on M1, but if you could, and installed Windows 10 through Rosetta 2, you would only be using about half a GB of memory, because the Windows file system requires very little memory, but instead utilizes enormous virtual memory (paging file space). Mac OS is not much of a paging file or virtual memory accolade. Two different animals there. Just beware, these new Apple products with M1 are not as good as many say they are. Even the availability of the new iPad Pro models are very few in production because of this 'radical' change that may require a complete rewrite of Mac OS, or forego unified memory, which is a different way of wording integrated components. Like the different ways of wording corn syrup in food products to 'con' the buyer into something 'healthier.' Three stars in that you will probably have difficulty doing much with this new chip and unified memory setup (you want to get at least 512 GB of storage, or maybe 256 GB is sufficient if you do not have many photos and videos to download).
"
Brian M. Murphree,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The headline says it all. Yes, the M1 chip is powerful, but few real software programs utilize it's awesome power. The list is growing however. In the meantime, I've spent a little time with the 24"" model, and I believe I walked away soon after I realized how poor the refresh rate is of the screen. Even the true accurate color wasn't enough to keep me from losing interest. Refresh rate is crucial.,Look, I've used a Mac mini M1 for months and I can honestly say, it's really GOOD! It also supports my 4K display with no issues and just as well as my 2020 Intel mini (in fact, better!). The new iMac has such power, and there's going to be an explosion in raves once software developers can eliminate the need for Rosetta2, the Intel translator that comes with the new iMac. Again, the display loses me.,All that said, Apple is doing exactly what they planned and it's going to be an amazing and thrilling ride. WATCH as they begin to show the rest of the PC community what real CPU/GPU power can be got for well designed hardware, in a thin case, and low-heat.,Pros: M1, slim shape, colors, and style. Even price is not so bad, if you think about it. just don't go for the extra storage. You'll be fine with fast USB-hubbed storage, or cloud storage where you need it. Plus, external or cloud storage will lower in price faster than this iMac will lose its value.,Cons: Display refresh and lack of ports. The display refresh rate seems awful to my eyes compared to other displays, and with only two (2!!) Thunderbolt/USB-C ports. Here's the reason you'll see people dumping these models shortly. They'll want more ports and Apple knows exactly how to tease.

Zac & Des,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Okay. So I work in the media production realm. Live video, post production etc… my organization is Apple crazy. We have iMacs, Mac Pros, MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, Apple Watches, we even keep an urn with ashes and because we don’t know who they belong to, we pretend they are Steve Jobs’.,Personally I was a PC guy before I started my work in the production world, but quickly fell in love with the simplicity and cleanliness of Apple machines. As we moved on from High Sierra through Mojave, Catalina and now Big Sur, I’ve learned that Apple removes support for the most random crap on the planet. And it just happens to affect so many things that we use in the production world. I could make a list here but that’s not what the review is about. This review is about the M1 iMac.,I had really high hopes for this thing. As a desktop, it’s great. If you want something you can run a business from and do some decent editing on, this thing is great. But it has a fatal flaw. If you want to use extended desktops, or send content to a video wall, projector, or stream content, you need to make sure that all of your equipment is from the last 18 months or so also.,Firstly, it only supports 1 (that’s right, one) external display. Though it has 2 (that’s right, two) thunderbolt ports. Secondly, I could not get the computer to consistently recognize external converters (HDMI to SDI, scalers etc…), these are important for those of us in the production industry. Thirdly, the issue is with the drivers (or Kexts for you Mac nerds) in Big Sur. It’s been an issue since 11.2 and persists through 11.6. There are forums and articles all over the web addressing the issue, but here we are.,THE FIX: Rollback to MacOS Catalina! Yup, just download it from the Apple website and away you goooo……. WAIT!!!!…..,It’s an M1 Mac. Catalina only runs on Intel based Macs. Bye.,Also… they gave up support for interlaced resolutions. That’s right, no more 1080i support. Which we use for some environments where older projectors or video switchers are being used.,I get it, it’s an older standard…. But so is 480p which is still supported lolz. I wonder what the gain for the end user was to remove interlaced resolution support. So weird.

David,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't have an iPhone, but Apple is pushing other people's text conversations with me from my non-iPhone to my Apple email account when they reply on their iPhones. This means that when they reply to text messages with me, it is not texting but sending through iMessage. That means I don't get their replies on my phone -- they only arrive on my Mac via iMessage.,So if you don't have an iPhone, be careful about getting a Mac, because it just might screw up your ability to text with people using your entirely different device with no associated Apple account. This is truly shady and monopolistic behavior by Apple to try to force someone who buys one of their products into their other products.,Apparently, just like all the other companies, I'm the product to Apple -- they just want to bilk me for more money and force me into their full ecosystem. And I don't even know how this can be fixed.

  Apple is overpriced and non-functional based on today's standards.  Was good at last Mona Lisa in the 80's, but now is just bloatware and crappy OS,  Do NOT buy.  If you are married to the interface, just load one onto Android or Windows and you get same experience but at  fraction of the cost and twice the horseepower.

  Coming from a 2013 i5 iMac the upgrade has been epic.,Everything runs at lightning speed. Installations of new apps is almost instantaneous. I click approve for install (using the awesomely convenient Touch ID button) and it races thru the steps and ready to open in a literal blink.,So glad I got 16g RAM. It’s wonderful to have everything open at once: a movie playing, 10 tabs in the browser, 7 other apps and downloading library to my SSD.. oh and all while e-mail history is loading. The monitor stayed fairly consistent at 10g RAM so 8g would have limited my fun.  Everything ran incredibly.,I wasn’t really fond of the style when in the Apple store, but now that it’s on my desk,  I simply can’t believe how gorgeous it fits in my home. The white bezels are perfect for the ‘home’ use and I’m glad they chose.,Overall I can tell this iMac will last even longer than my previous and stay future proof for years to come.,It looks, feels and performs exactly as a high end purchase should.,I insist you purchase one so you too can revel in the joy of an excellent decision you will appreciate for years to come

  I will start off by saying that I didn't buy this from Amazon, but I did buy it, whether I show up as a ""verified purchase"" or not.,This is a great upgrade to Apples desktop line IN EVERY WAY.,* Thinner,* Lighter,* Quieter,* Brighter,* Sharper Screen,* Faster,* Better Camera (important for today's video calls,Important things to know:,* you don't need to buy the upgrade one to get the features.  You can get the Touch ID keyboard for $50 more.,* You can get the ethernet for $30 more,* The 8 core GPU is not worth the additional $200.,* * Gigs of RAM is plenty for the average user.  The M1 chip makes it even more powerful,I love the look and feel of the computer, mouse, and keyboard.  Very premium.,It is expensive, but you won't be in the market for a new computer for a while and this one will age well.  You get what you pay for.,PS. I went with Blue. Looks cool.

  I'd been using a 24"" Dell monitor and desktop since 2013, and was looking forward to getting at least a 27"" screen this time round. Only problem was that I needed a computer right away as my Dell had it's HDDs stolen together with its USB backup drive.,Thank goodness I had a separate backup on iCloud from my MacBook Pro !,Anyway, I've got the 8-core 256GB Silver model with 8GB ram. The screen somehow feels bigger than its 24 inches. Text is crisp and images are sharp. I don't notice the white bezels at all. It's the best screen I've ever used.,Speakers are excellent. There are complaints that they're not loud enough; frankly speaking, if you need it any louder than it is, there's something wrong with you. The speakers are plenty loud.,I bought the iMac from Apple as I wanted the trackpad and keyboard with numeric keypad. I love the trackpad's Force Touch, and the keyboard's great to type on; the keys are tactile enough while being quiet: much better than obnoxious mechanical ones.,Finally, I'd to say something about the ""Hide My Email"" feature. While browsing, I came across a website that requested my email address. When I clicked on the Email field, macOS Monterey automatically offered to generate a proxy address instead of using my real one.,That's awesome !,Just one of the many ways Apple and MacOS are superior to the rest.

  These are a truly phenomenal pair of headphones with the best noise cancellation and transparency modes i’ve ever experienced before.

  If you’re indecisive about buying it, here’s a tip/something you should know about the AirPods Max. The AirPods are strong in sound and you could feel an orchestra in your ears.

Michael Richmond,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These sound amazing, something you would expect at this price range and the long standing reputation of the brand. Taking a star off for the quality of the charging case. The lid feels pretty flimsy and I am able to move it side to side as well as forward and backward when it is in the closed position, it also doesn’t close as snugly as my wife’s, who got a pair when they just came out. Due to these issues I actually checked the serial number with apple to make sure they are legit, and they are. The only difference between mine and my wife’s is that hers were made in China and these were made in Vietnam, this could explain the dip in quality I guess.

If you're willing to pay more for serious quality audio, these are a no brainer. Just get them already.

  No issues so far. Easy to set up. Came with damage to the power cord. Called Apple and after much frustration of being tossed around like a beach ball was able to talk to someone who knew what they were doing. Upgrade to the touch finger print. Well worth the extra cost. And buy the blue color or the silver. I think it looks the best and it's easier to sell later on. Also 24 inches is a lot better than 21.5 especially in  4k.

Touch ID is bs that’s on a keyboard does not allow u to share screen with other devices which would help excuse the investment it’s a pretty screen but feels Iike a massive down grade going back to needing a mouse all because they probably just want to sell touch pads ugh huge fail Apple

  It’s super fast and the screen is fantastic. Speakers and camera are some of the best I have used. I do wish I had gotten a full sized keyboard with numpad.

  Machine is well designed and very easy to use. It has sufficient capacity both in memory and storage to handle hundreds if not thousands of photos. If you are considering switching from a PC based system, this is the way to go.

  Box and packaging is true Apple style.,Love this iMac so much.,There are cords that match the blue as does the keyboard. I welcome time away from laptop now.
"
Jong Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nice machine and it is light. 24” is a bit small in my opinion. The amount of desktop footprint it takes is much less than the 27” previous gen version. I did find it annoying that the out of box setup requires to pair with the bundled keyboard and mouse. I swapped out both, especially since if you place the bundled keyboard on top of the base, it is metal on metal scraping.,None of the written reviews talk about this, but the display can be tilted with a negative tilt angle a few degrees. And the glass is one continuous sheet including the chin. It is just a different color but still covered in glass.

  These instantly pair very easily to my iPad, Apple TV and iPhone.  The silicone ear tips seal in sound. Absolutely wonderful on a plane or bus in noise cancelling mode.  On a recent flight I had two screaming kids sitting besides me.  Not only did the noise cancelling get rid of the jet motor noise, it cancelled out the screaming kids.  What would have been a nightmare flight was so very pleasant.  These are the best !

  Love everything about the airpods pro Except I had to go and purchase a new brick to plug in to wall to charge.  Should be included since it is a different brick than a phone charger brick.  No where in ANY description does it say that you pay $200 for something but it has a missing piece.  Apple is all about making money since they keep you buying new cords (a 3 ft cord doesn’t even go from wall to nightstand).  THIS NEW BRICK SHOULD BE INCLUDED OR STATE CLEARLY THAT YOU NEED TO PURCHASE ONE AND OFFER THAT OPTION BEFORE CHECKOUT.Because of this I give it 3 ⭐️ .

  These are labeled new, however as soon as they were paired with a phone they were labeled as “Christopher’s AirPods”. If these were new why were they named.
"
Toddd L. Tomlinson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The airpod pro's are awesome.  I got them for a great price during the black Friday sale and the only regret I have is not getting them sooner.  I have a tshirt and laser engraving business and these solve two problems - a) they filter out the background noise from the equipment and b) I can finally hear music / Amazon Prime Video / etc.  I did have to buy an additional power brick as I didn't have a USB C model.
"
W. R. Fowler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I found the sound quality to be a substantial improvement over my first Airpods. I was hesitant to buy because my first Airpods simply wouldn't hold a charge after a couple years. These have had no battery lifr issue this far using them for as long as four hours. I find them a bit uncomfortable for long use. The big surprise was how good the noise cancellation works; easily as effective as my Audio-Technica's or Bose Quietcomfort 3 and much more compact of course. The sound is not quite as good as expected which is why its a 4 star for me. I don't find that the spacial effect is particularly noticeable,
"
Stephen Halstead,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound is great for my limited knowledge and intended use. Unfortunately, they do not stay in my ear very well. Working out is extremely frustrating but even just walking around the house and doing single chores makes them fall out of my ear. I’ve tried all three sizes of silicone tips and even spent more money to get silicone tabs to help the problem, those didn’t work at all either. Rather disappointing going up near $200 for something this poorly designed, at least the sound and battery life are good when they actually stay put.
"
John Constantine,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great sound!,But - I have no idea how long these were kept in a wear-house but the case battery is degraded. For only 4-5 hrs only of use the case have to charged twice a day! Now Apple have to replace them.,Amazon is selling old pods.

  These AirPod pros from Amazon are not compatible with the normal Apple cable chargers, you have to by a special one for another $20 which can be a problem if you leave it at home and you go out of town not to mention it is just another cable to worry about.  However, if you by them from COSTCO, they ARE compatible with the normal Apple cable charger (of which I already have several - one for travel, for home and for work all of which work with my iPad, phone, old AirPods, and now my new AirPod Pros).  If you don't want to order additional cables just for your AirPod pros, I recommend ordering from COSTCO versus Amazon. They are about $20 more expensive but the normal cables work for charging.,ALSO, some of the reviews refer to the pods being made in Vietnam and therefore being poor quality.  The ones I ordered from COSTCO (I returned my Amazon ones due to the cable situation) also were made in Vietnam so that is a mute point. I believe those of poor quality probably ordered from a bad reseller on Amazon, just a guess.

"
M. Fargo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've owned around 7 ear buds, and these are by far the best experience I've had. First, the fit is solid and you're not constantly concerned they'll fall out, in addition, they're remarkably comfortable. The bluetooth connection is reliable and strong; there is rarely any drop of the signal. The sound and ability to alter (balance, volume, battery use) is what others advertise but don't deliver.
"
John Kish,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My kid wanted them for his birthday so I ponied up the coin. It seemed high for a pair of headphones but since he’s got them, it’s been silent in my house. You can’t put a price on that kind of peace in a house with teenagers. I feel like I sold Tim Cook my soul but the beautiful silence is worth it.
"
Priscilaoliveira ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very happy with my purchase. Got a 200$ gift card from Amazon and bought this pair the moment I saw it was on special for $179 ($192 with taxes). I’d perused them for a long time and was a little skeptical (I’m not a typical online shopper and I’m always afraid stuff will not be what I expect). Battery is fine till now, only charged the case once since they arrived last Tuesday (today is one week after, the case was at 79%). The charging is pretty fast, less than an hour with an iPad 12w charger. So far no complains!
"
Comatose,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely will NOT stay in my ears more than 4 or 5 seconds before popping out, usually into the dishwater, food, etc...you get the picture, go with the BEATS, I hear they are intelligently designed to actually fit your ears, what a concept!  lol  If you've already wasted your money on these, they DO sound great but you will definitely want to invest about $10 for add on wingtips or over the ear clips to ensure that you don't loose these the first time you stand up, speak or do anything that moves your head, jaw or body in the slightest.
"
Cris Wimer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased two pairs of these for mine and my wife’s trip to Maui so we’d have simmering quality to listen to on the long flights. THESE THINGS ARE WONDERFUL!  They are so small and lite that you forget you have them in (but this doesn’t mean they are sub-par because they are anything BUT sub-par). The batteries are fantastic (much better than you’d ever expect from this size). AND…OMG, the noise canceling is incredible. When turning noise canceling on during the flights it literally blocks out all the airplane jet noise and inside passenger noise.  Let’s put it this way…you’d never regret purchasing them.
"
Craig Mack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the 2nd gen AirPods and decided to upgrade to the pro’s since they were on sale. They’re great. The transparency mode is really cool and you almost can’t tell they’re in your ear. The battery life is about 4.5 hours. Although that’s not great, I use them one at a time so they last all day and they do charge really fast. My only complaint would be that Apple really needs to improve on the background noise cancellation. My 2nd gen pods almost seem to amplify background noise and these pro’s aren’t  much better in that area. I was outside one night when I used my 2nd generation pods and my buddy asked me if I was surrounded by crickets. CRICKETS ! that’s how bad the noise cancellation is on those. He said the noise was pretty loud.
"
VDV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was skeptical about buying them but as soon I charge them and set the easy process. I can’t put them down. Noise cancelation are super. I have to adjust them to make sure I hear around me.

  I ordered some Samsung noise cancelation pods and the noise cancelation seemed non existent. I almost settled but then I remembered trying my friend’s airpod pros and how good they were. I decided to return the Samsung ones and bite the bullet to get the AP Pros. The noise cancelation is AMAZING. Seriously can’t believe how well they work. I love going to the gym and then turning on the cancelation and having everything go almost totally silent. So cool. The different settings are fun and work perfectly. Highly recommend if noise cancelation is important to you.
"
Halle M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I did a ton of research and was very torn about what kind of wireless earbuds to purchase. I ended up getting these for a good price and am so happy I did. They work so well and they work flawlessly with my other apple products. I think the sound canceling could be a little better it’s not to the quality of over the ear sound canceling headphones but I guess that’s to be expected.
"
H.P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Yes, I definitely recommend the AirPod Pros! Perfect fit in my ears right out of the box (and they have 2 more ear cushion sizes included) The noise cancelling is so good that at first I had to get used to just how much sound it cut out... without that ""white noise"" of the other noise cancelling head phones. And, they have ""transparency mode""(had to look up what they call it)  so that I can hear the surroundings while driving (I use one for phone calls). Battery charges up quickly.
"
abby,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Got exactly what I wanted and shipping only took 2 days. My AirPods arrived with some sort of defection with the right pod where it would make a ticking sound whenever transparency mode or noise cancellation was on but all I did was take it straight to my local Best Buy and I was easily able to exchange them for a brand new pair which work perfectly fine. Great product and service
"

  I love mine. These reviews about cords and such not arriving in the box had me EXTREMELY anxious as I waited for the package's arrival, but it came in perfect condition...I'll admit I felt a little bougie unwrapping and opening the box. Early Christmas present...wasn't disappointed at all.,Battery life is still pretty good, though I know the next gen of these is going to make it matter much more to me in the future.,Authentic, really good sound quality, and worth the money, considering this is a steal ANYWAY with this type of discount.
"
Dominic Bialek,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not a product for me. I tried using them and had to return them because they just wouldn't sit in my ears. They sound good, but because of the suction not being good they never sounded any better than my gen 1 AirPods. I am disappointed in them because normally everything that Apple makes I love, but these were a miss. I am happy for anyone else who is able to enjoy them though.
"
Brett Duvall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These cancel noise from equipment in a loud machine room very effectively. Don't drop the case; a 2-foot drop onto my desk caused the lid to pop open and both airpods flew across the desk and onto the floor. No damage, but I am now looking for a case for the case of the airpods pro.
"
Tyler62290,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ill be honest, I'm an android person. I had the pleasure of putting in some air pods from a friend. They weren't the newest but they still sounded good. I listen to music constantly and talk on the phone for my job quite often. I consider myself a little bit of an audiophile. I have audio engines in my kitchen to give an example. These are quite incredible. I'm hearing stuff that even my 500 dollar kitchen speakers can't produce (not knocking audio engine... they are incredible). Regardless, they are awesome. Deserves credit... the noise cancelation and transparency is crazy. Noise canceling had me looking back like someone was behind me the first time I turned it on. 10 out or 10..... would recommend to a friend.

derekl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Positives: I love how you can adjust the transparency mode on your iphone and can enhance conversations or amplify surroundings!  Spatial audio sounds really, really good, including with movies!,Negatives: I like that Apple tries to give you different size ear tips, but I ended up going with some memory foam based ear tips that get an even better seal, comfort, and provide more bass.  Last very slight negative is noise cancellation is not as good as Airpods Max, but you can't expect them to do as good as Airpods Max due to their size, but compared to my old Track+ ear tips these are def better at noise cancelling.,Delivery: Amazon delivered next morning, even though tried to get it out for the evening, but hey, next morning very early is still extremely great service!  Top notch!!

  My AirPods were 100% authentic but one of them had glue on outside of airpod and wasn’t aligned properly. Ordered a replacement and will update!,UPDATE: Was super easy and I got new AirPods very fast. 10/10 and still 100% authentic (you can look up serial # in apple warranty checker). The ones that were made in Vietnam did come defective as someone mentioned previously but they were awesome about exchanging and I already have my new ones. The packaging is even different (no little tab on Vietnam ones just plastic). Either way I’d buy again!
"
SmileyPAIN,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The pairing is very clunky, sometimes it works great often times you must fiddle with it to pair and then maybe you don't get both of them. If not already paired and you want to answer the phone just answer it then get the buds out and wait with phone to ear for a while. You cannot update firmware without an iPhone or iPad.... Just save your self the effort. I wanted the transparency mode which is pretty sweet, but the hassle just isn't worth it. It's a bitter apple if you're not all in on Apple. I put my toe in and eh nope sorry Apple too much BS for that amount of $$$.

micdud,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Originally my wife and I bought a different brand. I could not get mine to stay in the one ear. Being how I had an iPhone, I bought these. They stay in my ears great. Overall great sound in all genres. Bass lacks a little, but sound quality is still excellent. Noise cancelling is okay. Transparency mode is good if volume is middle to lower. Taking phone calls on them is superb. Overall well worth the money.

  Si están dudando en comprarlos, dejen de dudarlo y simplemente comprenlos. Jamás había tenido una experiencia con audífonos como la tuve al usar esta maravilla. Es excelente, el noise cancellation es sensacional y la calidad de la música es buenísima. Le doy 4 estrellas por el hecho de que no incluye el adaptador para el cable, lo cual me parece inutil ya que el tipo de cable no es común y conseguir un adaptador de ese tipo puede ser complicado y un gasto innecesario, lo bueno es que igual puedo cargarlo con el cargador de mi iPhone, pero fuera de eso todo perfecto.

  I got these for my wife for Christmas and she loves them. Easy to link with her phone and good battery life of about eight hours.

  You get what you pay for.  These are expensive, but so far I think they are worth it.  My old 'plain' Airpods started losing battery life so I sprung for these new ones and they are better in every way.  They stay in my ears better (I had to use silicon ""wings"" for my original ones). They sound better, and the noise cancelling is a really nice touch.  Plus I got them on sale.
"
Lindsy  Malinoski,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered these yesterday in a panic when I could not track down a pair at Target. After reading several reviews, I decided to take a chance on them. Upon opening the package, everything felt legit and looked legit. I called Apple to verify the serial number and they approved the serial number and told me that they were a legitimate product. They ensured me that they even have a one year warranty based on my purchase date. Interesting case you are in a situation like me, just order them! They’re authentic! (At least what I received was.)

Reggie from Nintendo ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Was expecting these to be very underwhelming but they were actually pretty good, and with the big Amazon markdown, these were a steal.

  Please don't advertise these as new.  They are not.  I received mine with no plastic overwrap, They were completely dead. I charged them fully with another charging cable as it didn't come with one.  One ear did not work at all.  When I paired them to my phone they said ""momma's airpods"".  lol.  Also there was a small black hair in the case when I opened it..  yuck.

  I ordered brand new set but what I got was used. They had none of the wrappers and original cardboard pieces. The ear pieces had something black on them and the foam ear piece had black on them as well. Like $30-$50 difference for new and used so I definitely was cheated. Plus when I connected them they were linked to someone else’s email. Please don’t buy these. You will get burnt

  Truly disappointed in these headphones!  I have an older generation of basic airpods and was so excited to replace them with the newer airpod pros but the NEW ONES will NOT stay in my ears.  They fall out constantly!  Total disappointment because I need them for conference calls for work as well as taking the pup for a walk.  I almost lost one on a recent walk when it fell out and I had to find it!  Does anyone have any ideas?  These were too expensive to add any bands or hook fixes!  I also never write bad reviews.  As far as sound quality, they are great IF they stay in my ears.  Thank you!

  The sound on these if pretty good, better than I expected. I had tried the Sony Wf1000mx4's and their sound was spectacular. The problem is they didn't fit, they were too large to fit in ear canal. These don't fit perfectly, can fall out, but I would say they do fit okay.  I prefer having some volume control on the buds. Overall I'm okay with these.
"
Street_Chief,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The highs, mids and lows is really good. I can hear details I didn’t hear with my Air Pods 2. The Beats are garbage compared to these. The noise cancellation and pass through feature is amazing.

"
Dr. Manhattan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  All the new features minus the noise canceling and in ear tips, small, light and great sound, play and pause by taking them out and in your ear, worth the investment
"
Peter Riney,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love these! As always, excellent quality from Apple. I’m a little concerned that they may fall out of my ears during a sweaty workout by so far they’ve stayed put.

"
VladK,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  pro: works out of the box,  t1 for workout integration,  premium sound, especially with iOS, OS X,cons: noise cancelling is not very powerful,  works without advanced options with advanced android devices, though, private listening mode with roku puts the iPhone in charge of the sound, so, maybe, able to pipe DD that way
"

  I just got these a couple weeks ago and brought them to the Apple Store to have them looked at because they were they weren’t working late and they confirm that these are not legit Apple AirPods. Buyer  beware.
"
Crzymomof3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The air pods came uncharged but in the original box with everything included. The only blemish was a minor scuff on the back that could only be seen when holding at the perfect angle in the light.  I bought these as “used-acceptable” but they were more like “used-like new”.  Love them and love the bargain price of $142.99 almost as much as the air pods themselves.
"
James England,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They wouldn’t sync up to my phone. Apple store has to send them off for replacement. This is my second failed set from Amazon to send working air pod pros. I just took them to the apple store and they are making it right on both sets
"
Lisa Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The noise cancelling and spacial audio features are really fantastic!! I have really small ears and they felt a bit big at first, even with the smallest ear tips in, but I got used to them pretty quickly. The sound quality is really excellent and they pair (and stay paired) super well, especially compared to my old AirPods! I really love them!
"
PACH AND  COMPANY INC.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The rubber ear tips cause my ear so sore in 5 minutes. My Airpods 2 fit way better than the pro. I purchased the Airpods 3 and fit so nice on my ears. I guess, the fitment depends on your ear. The noise cancellation when disable, they cause screeching noise on my ears because the hood on my jacket rubbing the black things on the ear-set.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the best thing to touch my ears since... ever. I cannot express how impressed I am with every feature. First, the noise cancellation is absolutely exquisite for a headphone this small. Second, The Transparency mode helps me hear better than if these were not even in my ears. Finally, the specialized stereo is absolutely heavenly (I recommend listening to Hurricane by Kanye).,My only complaint is that the battery life could be a little but longer, but if you don't mind taking  5 minute break to let them charge in the case, which I don't, there is literally nothing wrong with these. (And for all of you who say they don't noise cancel, use different ear tips).
"
Brent C,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The product said ""NEW"" AirPods Pro. When received, the box had already been opened and the internal contents had been opened and played with as well! Ended up returning and buying from BestBuy for the same price.
"
J. Nix,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These were a great Christmas gift I received. Initial impression is I need to get the foam tips. These have fallen out of my ears 3x already and would hope that would help. As for the noise cancellation, I don’t hear much of a difference. Maybe it’s just me. All-in-all I’d say I like them and will more so after I work out a few “bugs.”
"
Ahmed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  AirPod pros are my go to option for everyday headphones I had a pair since they came out 2 years ago and I broke my first pair and I’m on my second one and I don NOT regret buying them at all especially  when it’s $159 RIGHT NOW on Amazon which is a steal. If you are looking for a holiday gift this is the right one

  Apple's Airpod Pro are excellent earphones. They are super easy to connect to any iPhone and work immediately out of the box. I like the sound quality and they fit just right in my ears. The battery life is good and overall they are my everyday go-to. Also didn't help that I got them at a good price during the Black Friday sale.
"
Karen K Sauer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am impressed with the sound of these earbuds.  I also like the ability to have them set in transparency so I can still hear things around me but the music and podcasts come through with amazing clarity.  Then, if I want I can set them to noise cancellation, which works well too.  I just love how well these apple earbuds work.
"
Nancy Hurtado,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have airpods, the older gen, and my hubby has always wanted his own pair, so for our anniversary I got him a pair of the newer gen and comparing the two, I Love the new gen air pods! The battery life is longer and the pods are smaller which helps when one is wearing earnings. Also love how its easier to clean any ear wax! haha
"
Christina R. Rice,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've loved the original Airpods for years now and was excited to upgrade to the Pro model.  Super disappointed that they won't stay in my ears for more than 5 minutes, even if I am sitting perfectly still.  Tried all the tip sizes, read instructions multiple times on how to put them in to make sure I did it correctly, but no luck.
"
nakedrider,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the sound quality but the fit is a problem, the same reason I switched over to my Caldwell set. The picture showed the silicone ear pieces which I wanted because they work so much better than my original AirPods, what I got is a better version of the originals (sound wise) but the same configuration. Uncomfortable and they fall out if not careful, my fault for not paying more attention but still a disappointment.
"
Dee,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very upset because I received a faulty pair of headphones as soon as I opened them. The right headphone had a continuous ticking sound and would not stop even when nothing was playing the second you out the headphone in, the ticking would sound. This was a BRAND NEW ITEM so there should not have been anything wrong with them.
"
Melo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love Bluetooth ear buds! These AirPods pros are the best at everything - except staying in my ears! Doing dishes? They’ll fall onto the floor or into the sink. Vacuuming? Same thing. Eating, taking, or quietly sitting at a desk doing nothing? They’ll fall out every 5-20 minutes.,They are the best product I’ve ever owned that cannot be used. Bought a pair for my girlfriend - she has the same problem. Weird, neither of us had this problem with cheap buds. We are both switching to Bose and selling our AirPods :(,Note: We both tried every size ear tip and also bought expensive aftermarket tips. Aftermarket helped but the buds still fall out constantly - really sucks the joy out of music. Selling both pairs of AirPod pros to a person with ears designed for them.
"

"

  This product sucks. Requires yet a new cable you don’t have after spending hundreds to just get the buds. Hate them And haven’t even charged them yet. Apple sucks.
"
Luke,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not sure if Amazon got the unwanted stock from Apple but the first pair I ordered had a problem with the battery life in the left airpod. After 30 minutes it would drop from 100% to 0%. The second replacement pair had a problem with the right airpod, when noise cancellation was turned on I would get static crackle. Disappointed and doubtful I'll buy through Amazon.
"

  I just got these today. I upgraded from my old AirPods that I’ve had for about 3 or 4 years to these and WOW what a difference. Can’t comment on the battery life yet and can’t tell you if they charge fast, because I can’t charge them. I don’t have the right kind of charger. I would have ordered one had I known that it required an Apple 20W USB-C power adapter to charge them. Going to buy one tomorrow. Otherwise I am super happy with these.
"

  Got these as a gift for my daughter.  She was leery of the Air Pods, mostly concerned about losing them. But once she got them she loved the connectivity with her iPhone.  Having seamless functionality is a huge plus.  And there is a way to find lost Air Pods that put my daughter's mind at ease.  Really good product!

Hugo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  En mi caso estoy utilizando las gomas mas pequeñas. Se ajustan perfectamente. Los audifonos no se caen ni salen de las orejas. La cancelación de ruido es casi completa. El sonido, para mi gusto, le falta algo de bajos, pero suenan bastante bien . La batería de cada uno de los fonos dura el tiempo suficiente como para mis necesidades. Aún no se me han agotado mientras los uso, y el tiempo promedio es de 4 horas continuas.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What an amazing improvement from the original version which I had been using for several years. The sound quality is great, the noise cancellation work fantastic, wore them on the plane even when not listening to anything. Battery life is about the same as my old pair when they were new, not the 30 minutes I was a getting after a few years of good use.
"
alittlebitofeverything,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the second pair of Pros in the family and we will continue to upgrade them as time goes.  The only issue I have and really it is minor, is that the battery life is just a bit shorter than the regular AirPods.  Not a big deal, put them back in the case and after about 30 minutes they are ready to go.
"
Justin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these in Jan 2022 thinking I was getting the newest model. Instead, I was shipped the A2084 models, made in 2019. These have known sound issues, specifically with a loud crackling noise when noise cancellation or transparency features are on. Sure enough, right out of the box these are unusable with noise cancellation on. Taking to Apple store today, may need to return. DO NOT BUY UNLESS GUARANTEED THAT THEY ARE NEWEST MODELS

  This is a upgrade for me from Gen 1 AirPods. I didn’t want the pros due to the eartips (i hate them!) I like the 3’s, they fit good in my ear, even though it’s a slight difference from gen 1. Satisfied with the sound quality. Would recommend if you don’t like eartips.

Jay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was skeptical of purchasing airpods as I had a pair of Bose QC 35s, which are amazing. However, I went ahead and got these thinking that if I don't like them, I'll just return them and stick with what I know. Needless to say, that won't be happening. They sound good, cancel outside noise very well (although Bose over-ears remain superior in this regard but that's due to different design), and I can use these seamlessly with Siri whenever I want to listen to some music or take calls. Love 'em. Oh, and I went for the Pro model as I needed the noise cancellation feature to help me focus while studying/working.
"
J.P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got these for my wife thinking we would share them. Jokes on me, she loves them. So my review is for the 10 minutes I got to play with them after charging. The sound quality is amazing. The noise cancelling is a huge asset for loud environments or mowing. I guess I will have to get my own pair now
"
Tia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Absolutely love the noise canceling, now of course with any earbuds if you get really sweaty during a workout they may try to fall out after awhile, but ifs not super frustrating bc it’s not a consistent issue, you can simply take them out dry the inside of your ear a little, pop them back in and get back to jamming while you workout! Highly recommend buying the AirPods Pro’s if your looking for an upgrade.
"
JH,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Flamingo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I did compare these to the Bose.  I liked the Bose, the sound seemed better.  But the Bose seemed bulky and stuck out of my ear too far.  Also, they didn't seem as easy to use.  Bose did not come with very good directions on how to use.  the Apple Brand was very easy for me to operate and had very nice clear directions compared to the Bose
"
pmanirojana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought AirPods Gen 3 and used it for a week, It didn't fit my ears canals, Got the Airpods Pro With a MagSafe Case during Black Friday Sales. I thought ANC will come in handy if I were to travel on the plane.,The only downside is the battery life for the Pro is 24 hours VS AirPod Gen 3 30 hours.
"
Trevor B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Was so excited to use these when I received them, until the right Airpod started having a ticking noise when using noise cancellation or transparency modes. Tried to get a replacement pair from Amazon, they couldn’t. Troubleshooted with Apple, they took them in for repair, sent them back saying that they were fixed, and the right airpod is still making strange noises. I’m sending them in again to get them looked at, however, I almost wish that I had just gotten the refund. Not happy at all so far.
"
Harriet Booklover,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Its functions - sounds & noise canceling etc - are fine.,It may work for many people but doesn’t fit in my ears.  It keeps falling off while running. But with the Comply foam, AirPods drops only sometimes and become usable.  I am still not sure if I can use AirPods for trail runs.
"
Tyler Busse,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nice things cost a lot. It's kind of a theme in life. These AirPods are nice and cost a lot but not as much as some other pieces of plastic that usually end up being shoddier or more difficult to use (looking at you Sony).,For the money, these are probably the best in ear noise canceling headphones with stupid long descriptions that you can buy.
"
N.J.G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  **This review is not based on the performance of this product but addresses the authenticity of the item(s).,These were ordered during Black Friday and arrived ahead of their ETA. The packaging was intact and looked ‘official’ however upon inspecting them out of the package they looked like they may have been previously used/owned. There was a white stain on the right Airpod and the seams on the pods looked dingy and had random debris on them.

  I assume a lot of people will like these but they simply do not fit my ears. For me the 2nd Gen airpods are a much better choice

"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  the worst apple headphones. Too large to fit the ear, always slipping out even at slight head shaking. The buttons instead of sensor is a nightmare: it is hard to find and the headphone is always out when you're trying to push it... total crap

"
Aitor Sánchez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  He sido un fan de los airpods desde que salieron al mercado. Creo que es el producto de Apple más disruptivo después del iPhone. Esta versión, la 3, mantiene la versatilidad de los originales, pero con un sonido y una batería mejorados. Además, con un tamaño más compacto.

Over and Under,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Well, I don't know if it's the angle or the size of the buds. They don't sit in my ears. Fall out too easily.,I've got two previous models and the Pro. The best ones are the I pod 2's. Think I'm going to change make when the time comes

  I delayed the purchase for a long time, not being sure about the convenience, but they are great. The sound is really acceptable and I have a lot of very good headphones at home. It is known not to be a hifi but that's not the point.  They are great for everyday use.
"
Kaitlyn Nichols-O'Neill,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These were advertised as ""new"" - they were NOT. There was literally earwax inside both ear buds already. Disgusting.

  good!!
"
David,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s perfect. If it doesn’t fit twist it a bit when it’s in your ear and it’s good. It has everything pros have but just no noise cancellation/transparency mode. It counter back tho with better battery life so imo it’s really good. Highly recommend to get.
"
Austin P. Murkland,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s designed for a very specific type of ear; mine is incompatible except for one veeeeery specific position that is difficult to find. Loved the original AirPods. Wish these didn’t hurt so much.

"
Brandon Adams,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Theres no arguing that these are good headphones however I have had many problems going from Iphone to Mac. I was drawn into something that could ""seamlessly switch"" between the two and to my great disappointment this just doesn't happen. I have constant problems getting my Mac to detect the airpods when they auto connect to my phone. I have also had the headphone just have terrible audio quality until i disconnect and reconnect them to my Mac and occasionally all sound will stop playing until I disconnect and reconnect again. The bright side is if you are getting these purely for an Iphone I haven't had a single problem well connected and/or getting connected to my phone and the audio quality has always been great.
"
carol,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Did not know I needed cellular. By the time I realized, it was too late to return. I need cellular to have unlimited WiFi - this was disappointing. I thought I could exchange.

"

  This is my first 'ipad'.  Have owned various other tablets in the past.  Because I prefer Apple phones, decided to try the Apple ipad.  So pleased.
"
Martin J. Champagne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I never liked the wired headphones that come with the iPhone so I was reluctant to buy these. However, they fit well and I especially like they don’t come out when running. Work well for phone calls. These are the first Apple headphones I’ve had that I like and I even retired my Bose over-ear headphones in favor of these.
"
MJZemore,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sounds really good, compact, fits in ears nicely however, it came with a charging cable that doesn’t fit. What am I supposed to do with the cable? 🤷🏼‍♀️ I had to buy a separate charger which I think is ridiculous being I spent so much money in the first place. That part is very disappointing.
"
Moishe Yidbaum,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I listen to audiobooks while on a treadmill at a gym. Although I have to frequently push them in they are great at cutting out the noise.
"
Bike Guy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They came in a resealed package, had polishing compound on them, squealed and were previously paired to another device. Returned for refund
"
Linda Stella,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are great. The one thing I was not expecting was that it felt like having a terrible cold when your ears are completely stuffed up. It took a bit to get used to, but the sound is great! It also cancels most noise on my side for those I’m talking to. I can have the car window open while talking on these AirPods and the person I am talking to can’t hear that!
"
saxmanlady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had for many years used a Jabra for my Bluetooth. When I went to order new, and I guess being out of the market myself I discovered all ear buds were in sets of 2. I researched earbuds and these rated the highest, and I love them. They paired themselves to my iPhone and iPad. The sound and comfort are exceptional. Well worth the money! Kudos to you Apple!
"
Tanvi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received the item tampered. The box had clearly been opened and re-taped. My mailroom is secure and has cameras so it had been tampered with before delivery. I opened the box and the airpods were missing. Only the charging cable and instruction manual was there, the airpods were stolen.
"
Matthew Haber,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received these in the mail today with nothing in the box but the various ear pieces. Unacceptable.
"
Jake Bullet,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple, is it enough of a money grab for these expensive earbuds that you PURPOSELY did not include a power adapter, just so most normal human beings with no USB-C power adapter have to shell out another $20? Has the greed level reach a new high? This was a Christmas present, which WAS NOT OBVIOUS it was missing crucial parts make this ""work"". WOW. Get over yourself apple, and thanks for ruining a Christmas present.
"
@PlusModel_Drake,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Buy them they’re legit. I was nervous about buying these from Amazon thinking they would be knockoffs but im pleased to report i was wrong.
"
Sailoosha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Before buying I heard that as soon as you keep it in your ears the sound becomes very clear. And it is true. I really liked how it is linked to the phone, for example if one of them falls out of your ear, it pauses the video, it resumes the video once you keep the ear buds in ear again.
"
Brenda Marcy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m so angry! I don’t know if it’s Apple or Amazon that no longer includes the ability to charge Apple devices. I feel cheated. I can no longer trust both! It is deceptive & unethical! The top line on ur descriptions should read DOES NOT INCLUDE CHARGING BRICK & it’s different than before.
"
Datruf,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I waited way too long to buy these but I’m glad I finally did. Perfect for airplanes, blocks out almost everything when in noise cancellation mode, even without anything playing. Sound is clear and they create a immersive environment when watching a movie or show. The charging case is awesome too. Highly recommended.
"
TheProblem,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm not an apple fan.  These are for my son. I think these buds look like his ears need help draining or something and the color doesn't help. He loves them but couldn't charge them so he only used them once so far.  For the price I feel like I got stiffed on the charger.  To be fair.  Samsung does the same thing.
"
Bynn,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  i love most of the features that they have like noise-canceling or transparency,it fits in your ears nicely and stays there,it says that they last for 4-6 hours fully charged but i tend to find that it depletes batteries really quickly if im using the noise cancellation,no other problems,connects to apple products really well
"
Omar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The AirPod Pros are a pretty good overall earphone when used with your Apple products. Great sound quality, nice perks in noice cancellation and spatial audio. Much better fit in the ear verse the original AirPods, so if you’ve had a problem with ear fit with the original AirPods then these are a much better improvement. Battery life is decent, not the best (ran me about 6 or so hours off of multiple charges in the case) A word of caution, the charging case did stop recognizing the right bud when being placed in to charge, but not sure if this is due to a defective case I received or something else had occurred. Regardless, I’d recommend these as the standard earphones to get with your iPhone.
"
JL2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound quality is excellent, better than my old LG Tones that they replaced. Battery life s the one Draw-back. The charging case also seems fragile. Over all, they work well and I am very satisfied that I purchased them! I won’t go back to the around he neck style now that I’m use to the in ear pods.
"
Lisa Schmidt ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If your sitting on the fence on this one, get off! Sound quality is incredible. Great battery life. I got sone and lived so much I purchased these for my son!
"
Joseph,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Probably some of the best sounding earbuds I’ve EVER heard. Too bad the noise cancellation messed up my ears a bit after long use making them feel clogged.,Perhaps this won’t be an issue for you but it’s worth mentioning.,Note: you can turn off the noise cancellation feature (but you may as well buy the AirPods 2/3s for half the price if that’s the case)
"
abby,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  iPad Air offers so much more than the base iPad. It's worth taking the step up if you can afford it. For the increase in price, you get a larger screen, stronger audio, faster networking, a much more powerful processor, better Apple Pencil support, and a superior build. That makes the iPad Air a good long-term investment.
"
Jadayne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm happy with it. The body feels great and doesn't show finger prints. The screen is vibrant and responsive. The battery lasts 1-2 days on regular to moderate use but dies much faster on long video calls.,The main issue I had was with Skype and Zoom as it would drop the audio. I just needed to update iOS in settings. Works fine now.,I use mine for drawing, animations, entertainment and work and I have not had any permanent issues with my device so far.,I got the higher storage option and I think I made the right choice based on my needs.
"
Dominique Salandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased this for my adult daughter.  She is always pleased with all her Apple devices.  This continues to be a great addition to her other devices.  She bought this to compliment her Macbook Air.  She uses it to mainly take notes at univesity, draw portraits, and so much more.  It arrived well-packeaged in mint condition.  We continue to be pleased with Apple.  Thank you for another great product!
"
Tnjrichter,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The screen tends to not recognize touch. The battery life is very limited when using it. I purchased this for my home business and it is not user friendly for many things. The tablet freezes up at times. Many apps will will work only in portrait mode. I am not impressed.
"
James Goodrich,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's awkward to use and is not user friendly.  My ipad 2 was a better tablet.  The slide one's fingers across the ipad to open an app or close is really not the way I want to operate a tablet.  Buying this apple tablet was,a mistake.
"
Lantzer1116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Replaced my broken ipad2. This Air4 is AWESOME. Solidly built. Picture quality is amazing. Fast processor. With dongle can download and edit GoPro video from card.,Quickly and seamlessly, no jittering.,Had iPad for 6plus years. This should last much longer. I Love Apple products. I am impressed with this Air4
"
G. Gardner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Really liking the new Ipad.  Set up was a breeze and screen quality is perfect.  Get the Zugu case to go with it.  A bit disappointed at how fast the battery runs down, could just be I have a lot of apps.  Pleased overall.
"
cazguy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my third iPad upgrade over the past 10 years (and yes they all still work).  New chip pops color and speed and when coupled with the keyboard, stands in for your laptop when attending meetings or traveling.  Works seamlessly with iCloud.  Love the compatibility with Apple Pencil 2.0 for quick on the go notes if the keyboard was left behind.
"
Binita ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  its too heavy to use everyday. wanted to replace it with another iphone or kindle, but return window was closed already.
"
John Marshall,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love the new iPad Air 4th generation.,Disappointed there is a new connection for this device:  USB (C). The 3 ft cord included is adequate for charging but not for use while charging unless you haul out an extension cord. Guess I’ll shell out some coins for a 6 footer.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple once again demonstrates their total disdain for the consumer!  After waiting for the watch to finally arrive, SURPRISE!, Apple doesn't send the watch with a power block to allow you to charge the thing.  But wait, you can purchase one from Apple, for additional cost and then wait for that item to arrive.  I'm one customer waiting for the karma bus to roll all over Apple....
"
Jeff,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Used as a watch and a fitness and health tracker.,Disappointed that the mobile apps are overpriced and require a monthly subscription. Also requires the the wireless Apple headphones and additional monthly data subscription added to phone bill to make full use of the product capabilities.
"

   I love the watch and capabilities. Make sure you’re running latest iOS. This will save on setup time. You will need a USB c adapter to plug the charging cable into as only the cable is included. Mobile access requires you to be the account owner on your cellular account. Not negatives, just information. Battery life is 8-10 hours.
"
kim meara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Could not charge watch didn’t have or know anything about the charger cube needed! After spending $530 battery lasted 24 hrs! Waiting on delivery of adaptive cube to charge it and finish learning  how to use watch.,Christmas present without the batteries! Co e on Apple you could afford to send a charge cube!

  This new Iwatch 7 is great! BPM gauge, connectivity, look, make it outstanding! I liked It!
"
Ellen S. Predham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nothing to do with the watch but I long for the days when you got a printed booklet to refer back to when you had a question on how to do or resolve an issue. You can download but I personally that annoying especially if you have issues in syncing your watch with your phone.
"
Joanne Smith,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the 4th IPad I’ve purchased for family members and it is the only one I received with a dark mark along the Apple Logo on the back of the IPad.  It suggests it was used or Quality Control is not what it used to be.  I have no choice but to keep it since My last one was on its last legs and literally died after I was able to transfer everything to this new IPad.  ....however, I feel as though Apple standards are lacking.  I never thought I would feel this way about Apple!.  A long long time user of Mac/Apple going back to 1978.
"
Val,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My husband asked for a tablet and being a Mac user I thought this would work perfectly for him.  He scoffed at first, but after he played with it a bit realized it is a really great tablet for drawing and other use.  He loves the ease of use and particularly loves the drawing application.  It turned out to be a nice birthday present for him.
"
Lynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this to replace my iPad 5th generation. The difference in the screen size is amazing. I’m still getting use to not having a home button and holding the tablet so that the Touch ID is in a convenient place. But other then that I love it.
"
Frances Livesay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had five iPads, they are all in use. iPads are so easy to use when compared to other tablets. I carry one with me at all times, I watch movies on them, check my e mails, use them for texting, use internet when I research and have questions, take pictures and use them for video books, record videos and I am sure I have forgotten other uses. Oh yes, FaceTime and some phone calls. I also watch videos on you tube.
"
Evita,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received by iPad it tried to set it up. it told me to do a quick start using my phone but would not allow me to do so. I tried to do it manually and it told me to choose a wifi network but there was none to choose from. I then choose to set it up using my Mac and I finished it but they wifi button was gray and wouldn't let me click on it. since I didn't get cellular I could do nothing on my iPad. I tried to get it replaces since it said I could when I bought it but amazon told me I could only return it. because of tax I lost about $50 dollars this way. Im sure it works fine for others but mine did not work. they will probably try to resell mine though so be careful. maybe just try being from apple instead.
"
Mr Big Face,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Beautiful display, nice and smooth. Really everything I wanted from a tablet. Buy a better charger for this because it won't be the best charger as far as length.
"
Princess1529,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The ipad is beautiful….however, 5 days after having it, it was getting heated then I noticed the screen started lifting from the upper left hand corner, down the left side almost to the center. I was so disappointed. However I was lucky enough to purchase the warranty from Apple so I’m currently getting the battery replaced. Do NOT buy from Amazon. Buy directly from Apple. This is ridiculous.
"
Marco Antonio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered the sky blue and it’s very elegant yet simple. I love it, I’ve already downloaded so much from jwapp and hasn’t slowed down at ALL. I also downloaded two art apps as well and still works like a charm. The speakers are outstanding, the touch sensitivity is extremely accurate, etc. Worth the wait and buck.
"
Kim Holland,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have the iPad Pro 2018 and 2020 and this iPad Air is just as good. I love the color which is complained about the most. It’s meant to be a light green and it doesn’t disappoint. I don’t get why apple won’t make their iPad pros in different colors (same with the phones).
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like the tablet this the second time I buy a iOS on Amazon and both times the tablets were legit and brand new , it came with App Store arcade subscription for 3 months and my other iPad which I also bought off Amazon came with Apple TV free 3 months as well. Haven’t had issues with either of them and they are legit but cheaper from Amazon then the Apple store by like $50. It still comes with a warranty just as if u bought it straight from Apple
"
Aaron m.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The noise canceling feature literally makes it feel like the air is getting sucked out of your ears to create a airtight seal… it’s not actually doing that, but it feels like it. It’s literally life changing. I wear these around all day and the transparency mode acts almosssst like a hearing aid. It’s not the best for conversation but i swear it strongly increases ambient noise in my surroundings. For example: I was grocery shopping with these on just on T mode and no music playing. I was jamming out to some music that the store was playing overhead… I took them out and all of a sudden I couldn’t hear the ambient store music anymore! Overall love these and battery life is pretty great!
"
B,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love everything about these ears buds except that they dont stay in my ears. I love how compact they are and they sound amazing, but anytime I do any activity other than sitting they fall out if my ears. I tried all three size ear tips and the result is all the same. Sad to spend this much on a pair of earbuds and I cant even do any activities while wearing them.
"
Ryan C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound is incredible and the noise cancellation is like magic.  These stay in my ears where the original AirPods would always fall out.  I bought them because the noise cancellation allows me to focus and hear the content.  Second reason was looking for a pair that stayed in my ears.
"
Erica,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I tried two different pairs of these that are off brand and only $30 or so. Horrible horrible. Finally splurged on the AirPods and I can’t believe what I was missing. Great sound, notifications for texts and calls, nose cancellations, don’t fall out of my ears. Love them!
"
Carl McLain,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  There is nothing I dislike about the Apple Air Pods Pro.  The sound quality is fantastic and the comfort is outstanding., The experience of having the capability to listen to Spacial Sound via Bluetooth in lieu of having wired head phones is a real nice feature.
"
Seagrl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had to get these because Apples are the only thing that stay in my tiny ears. The sound quality and noise cancelling are great! Wore them to the gym and I’ll admit I still had one earbud fall out a couple times but way less than others I’ve used and mostly to do with my smaller ear opening.
"
Rethink,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great at noise control, making everything go silent.,Transparency mode is like a hear aid kinda,Great audio performance and sound,However they still need to work on keeping it in the ear. My left ear keeps bushing it out, making it drop
"
Freddy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had the AirPods 2nd and it had no issue with connecting. Not the care for the AirPods Pro. Right airpod is always not pairing. I usually put in both AirPods into my ears and their always connected and in sync. These are not and now the case is flashing white and will no longer show up on any Apple device when opened.
"
chantelle anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They are great! I read the reviews and got worried but the ones I received are clean no seem true apple airpod pros. Couldn’t ask for anything better. Was amazed by the noise cancellation, but can still hear my rock tumbler a bit. Love how it still lets you hear a person talking to you, so cool! Bass is not bad, not as good as my wired beats but they are good. Bought for work so I can eat lunch and watch my phone and not bother anyone, so these will be perfect, also wireless charging works really well too! Just be super careful not to put a hard case on it unless you want it on there for awhile, really hard to take off a hard case.

  The sound was amazing and I was surprised when I could not hear other people talking. The battery life is great. The only problem I have is they do not stay in my ears. I have changed the ear buds and they still fall out. I want to love them but I’m afraid that I will lose them.
"
Anamaris R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Have had it for about a month. The charger stopped working after it fell from average-ish height (my desk). However, the watch itself is great. I use it for my runs, the phone feature when I’m driving, and the health app. The best feature is the find my iPhone. I use it daily and it saves me the time of logging into the app. I rate it 4.5/5 because of the fragile charger.

Sid,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Got my watch series 7 41 mm through Amazon. I was skeptical at first to receive a fake watch for all this money. Well, the watch is real and works perfectly, paired instantly with my iPhone and is so far so good!
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Shocked & dismayed that for a $500 piece of technology, Apple couldn’t supply a wall plug for the mag charging cord. Of course it’s a USB-c fitting so can’t use older USBs without adapters.
"
Draama,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THIS WATCH  IS THAT IT IS SO COMPLICATED.
"
Patricia W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had a Series 4 for3 years- supposedly charger magnet became dislodged by a possible power surge and unfixable. Battery on new phone lasts long and like the new features but should have a trade in at the least
"
PhotoShots,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had a Series 2.  Major upgrades since then.  Love being able to track pulse oxygen levels, etc.,  throughout the day.  Much more medical info available on the 7 as opposed to the 2.  Very happy with my purchase.

Sozi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had to replace my old iPad mini after it became so slow and a lot of apps are not working on it. This one is the newest and I hope it will last for 5-6 years like the other one . The battery life is the same pretty much.,But the screen resolution is a lot better and it is fast in navigating websites and apps. I really like it.

"
Nick,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  BEWARE!! Product serial number invalid upon checking apple device online, and then calling apple representative confirmed fraudulent item. Will return for refund as soon as possible. Should have heeded the advice of the comment/review section stating that it is not authentic but went ahead and bought due to it being sold directly by Amazon. Rolled the dice, took an L.
"
Nick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been putting off buying these AirPods. I finally bit the bullet for Black Friday sales, and I’m very glad I did! These are an amazing Apple product, sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation feature is awesome! Invest in these bad boys. You’ll be glad you did!
"
Jose,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  La carga de los AirPods 2da generación era más duradera que la de estos , pero el sonido bloqueo externo del ruido es muy bueno.
"
Albert Martinez,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After my daughter had them up and running and working properly with her phone, we loved it! But, the next time she use them, they were not able to sync with the phone. I tried on my phone and they still didn’t work. I sent them back for a refund and ordered new ones
"
Blue Alligator,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These earbuds offer high-quality noise cancellation and audio quality. Annoyingly, these can’t be added to your iCloud devices. Most frustrating part is how I constantly have to push the earbuds in every 4 minutes to avoid them from falling right out. I tried the other sizes but the issue persisted. I have a rather average-sized ear and put the earbuds into my ear canal every time. The wired apple $15 earbuds fit better than these $250 wireless earbuds.
"
Loyal Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I returned the AirPods  sealed and unopened. Amazon claims the item was not present. This is a scam or theft. Amazon can do nothing to internal trace the problem. BEWARE.
"

  These don’t hurt my ears like other Apple headphones. I’m glad I bought them. GF loves the pair I got her also.
"
Jhonny,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These airpods is good with the noise cancellation, but the quality of the audio is not better then others, you can buy other earbuds for $60 or $70 and have better audio
"
Lesley Harlem,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First of all, the rubber pieces make it so that they don't fit in my ears. These fall out of my ears nonstop not to mention they're not comfortable and it doesn't even work for noise cancelling so it's pointless. Then you have the squeeze to play/pause/skip. This is the worst modification. Every time I squeeze the Airpod it messes up the position in my ear. I love Airpods but the modifications on the pros are just disappointing and the better sound quality doesn't outweigh the other negative aspects. I'm keeping my first generations and bought some Bose to use when I need noise cancelling.
"
Michael Guzman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got the AirPods Pro and I am not happy with what I got. The noise cancellation is good and all but, the battery life is a no no. There’s some features that I like but the amount of time before you have to recharge them are not what I expected.

"
Bhas,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple gives a cable type usb c to charge the watch, but not the power adapter. Unless you already have one such, you can't charge and use this apple watch after paying  $300+. You need to buy 3rd party product to charge this watch. Not expected from Apple.
"

"

  Watch is very versatile and looks great. Easy to use and an abundance of info. Be careful, our first box was missing the actual watch and one band. Seems like the seals were broken. Amazon replaced immediately.
"
Norma Masaki,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this watch.  It's easy to setup.  The only problem is the battery does not last too long on standby.  I have to shut it off but even at that, I still have to charge it every so many days.
"
Carol,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch is fantastic. It’s like taking all other watches and super sizing them. It was definitely worth every penny and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I thought the watch was a waste of money until I got it.
"
Carla S. LeLaCheur,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have no idea if I will like it or not. My first Apple watch and I live in a small town with not many places to shop and you don't include a $10.00 charging plug when I pay $800 for an apple watch. The end won't fit in any of my charges. You really should disclose when I ordered or send me a free one. One would assume for that kind of money I would be able to charge it without having to search to find a plug. I AM NOT HAPPY The reason many of us shop online is because we don't have a Best Buy or Apple Store just around the corner.
"
Lau,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a great smart watch. It is very useful and keeps you updated even your not beside your phone. It helps me maintain my daily exercise and health app. This is the best smart watch and I recommend it. Its a bet expensive but it comes into clutch anywhere, anytime.

  I've had the 3,5 and now 7. I love the bigger screen and all the new functions. The battery lasts longer and you can now type on the screen for texts! I love it for working out and running as well. However apple needs to give the charger a home and stop sending just the cord. But overall the watch is great!
"

Fred,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So far, not impressed.  For the price paid for the watch you would think they could throw in a charging adapter.  Seriously!  It comes with outdated charging wire without adapter.  That’s kind of like buying a car without a gas tank.  Very disappointing.
"
Kingsley Jephter,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nice one, but the battery drains once it is not being charged (whether it is worn or not). Thus, it has to be continuously charged 24/7. Not a good one.

  It’s a cool product that basically extends your iPhone onto your wrist, but I just have trouble finding a reason why I need it. It doesn’t really do a whole lot that your iPhone already can’t do besides heart rate monitoring and the activity app

"
Yvan Del Valle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Don't buy it if you are not 100% sure that you will keep it. Amazon will not approve the return if you open the box and try it. Better buy it on Best Buy, Apple store or someplace else where you can return even if you open the box.
"
Russell Pickman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Miles better than the Bose 700s, which I had to return. Build quality, connectivity, battery life and noise cancellation are top notch too. The case sucks, but I don’t even use it. Sound profile is bass heavy. Not the brightest sound, but I prefer that. There are more expensive headphones that sound even better, but these are worth the money.
"
Cincinnatian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They’re clunky, the case that comes with them is trash, and the battery life is nowhere near what I would call acceptable. I’d still give them 5 stars.
"

"
RichJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sounds wonderful (when the dialogue isn't lagging when watching movies) and perfect for the Apple user, which I am.,BUT $500+ is way too much, so I'm returning it. Also the ear muffs had this funky smell to it.,So unless you are a rich Kardashian with no sense of smell, these are not for you.
"
Ian,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Just buy drop+THX pandas. Look better, sound better, feel better
"
K M,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This headphone is premium quality but it has several design flows.,First of all, if you have relatively big head, ear cups won’t fit well. Also when you try to store the headphone into the case, metal parts of ear cups scratch each other.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are great. I’ve bought almost everything when it comes to headphones. Not sure how much money I’ve spent. But these stand out. Great great product.
"
Andrew N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sounds like you’re in the center of a movie theatre when watching content with Dolby atmos. Incredible sound quality. Best noise cancelling I’ve experienced and transparency mode is remarkably good. Great investment!
"
Eduardo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Short answer, no. Long answer depends if you have the money, because for me they are great since I have big ears and not all over ear headsets fit comfortably. This one is good at what it does. And looks amazing from the outside.
"
Michael Burkhardt,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They’re really good but are only worth it if you really love Apple products. Sony WH-1000XM4s are a better value and just as good, if not better, in most areas. They’re also $200 cheaper.

Bgoode,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great ear buds. Very nice pairing and interaction with the IPhone. Sound quality is much better than the JBL buds I’ve had previously. Bass sounds good. Battery life hasn’t been an issue thus far. Have yet to exceed battery limits. Noise cancellation is decent. Very comfortable to wear. Would highly recommend getting a silicone case (with an attached top) for protection. Wireless charging is a big plus. I recommend this product.
"
heather,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These were a Christmas gift to my husband. He uses them ALL of the time and is extremely impressed with them. They have all of the bells and whistles that you’d expect with an Apple product. The noise cancellation is excellent, sound quality is amazing, and they’re lightweight as well.
"
Dallin Larkin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm honestly not the biggest Apple fan. I'm mainly an Android/Windows user, but these have no nonsense connectivity and just work. The noise cancellation is top tier, the soundstage is great, and pretty comfortable buds. I do dislike it using the proprietary lightning cable, but it's an Apple product, so I'll have to deal. All in all fantastic buds, and do recommend them if you can find them on sale.
"
TinCupSFA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods Pro’s are worth every penny of the $179 I paid.  The sounds is great and the multiple tips that are included makes it easy to get them to fit properly.  The spatial audio and noise cancellation are pretty amazing!  I’m very happy with these earbuds.
"
Tom C,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had seen these everywhere and particularly the gym. They don’t seem to hold on to blue tooth in the gym for some reason and they keep falling out. I tried the various sized inserts but the mediums fit best, but i really can’t use them during my workout as they keep falling out and then I have to stop and look for them. Very disappointing for the price.
"
Marjorie W. Dunaway,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Marjorie's husband writing this.  She likes them quite a bit. I can listen to the news and she's happy listening to her stuff, especially study stuff.  Small light wt.  Just when I try to talk to her I can't tell she's got them on and ignores me ha ha.
"
Evan Rodriguez,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got mine, and right out the box they were magical. Great noise cancelling, customizable fit and a case built like a bullet. I thought they were really nice, but I noticed later that the case's hinge was clicky. I figured that it was dismissable, but they weren't done with the issues yet. Earlier today in the car, I was listening to Home by AAAMYYY and they cut out. Immediately after, they played the most deafening static noise I've ever heard for about 20 seconds straight. When they were finished with that, they skipped the song entirely. That was pretty frustrating, and I'm trusting them less and less.
"
LoloniSadie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my second Bluetooth headphone after trying the Sony $250 but ended up returning since I was not happy with the sound quality.  This was on sale $70 off and gave it a try and love it.  The sound was great, with perfect fit and all the integration with IPhone.
"
Denil,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Now I am not saying it’s a bad product, I’m saying it’s bad at what it does. I ordered my AirPod pros while at vacation, and when I got to the airport and went through tsa, I lost them. Now I’m thinking thank god “find my” is a thing because now I can find it! And guess what? Opening the app, I come to see that Apple basically told me “yeah, no” and didn’t bother tracking my headphones from after I woke up. Looking into the app, it only shows me where my AirPod pros we’re when I first woke up, and didn’t keep track afterwards, so here I am without something smaller than an apple, and costs more than one.
"
Stephen P. Murray,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had delayed in purchasing these for quite some time until I saw a killer deal ( saved 100 bucks), and now I know what all the fuss is about. I'm presently dealing with a right arm in a sling for six weeks and I'm dictating this into my iMac through my AirPods without any difficulty whatsoever. Just do it. (Oops sorry wrong motto...)
"
mike9199,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have tried Bose, the Airpods Pro and the Galaxy Buds for my Samusung flip phone. The Airpods Pro come out on top. Better sound quality and if you like the Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos experience, the Airpods Pro are the way to go. I am not a fan of the placement of the answer calls button on the Airpods. The Airpods Pro are small which makes it difficult to touch the button to answer Calls.
"
Rachel_FL,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ordered the Airpods on 01/11/2022, received them on 01/12/2022. Yet the warranty started on 12/30/2021.,Be careful folks and please match your purchase date to the warranty start date.
"
Davis Kleven,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Was leery about these, because headphones like these tend to fall out for me. But these nestle right into the ears and stay there. Haven't had a battery issue yet, and I'm done listening to music before I get any sort of battery warning (a complaint I had with my last Bose pair). As with seemingly everything with the Apple name attached to it, just a solid piece of engineering.
"
hypnerotomafia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Purchased item in new condition (not used, not refurbished!) and upon opening box the headphones were clearly used with ear wax from previous user! The case was also scratched and used. Definite miss.
"
Shari Fullenlove,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are great ear pods.  quality sound and great at blocking out background noise... just don't stay charged long. i have to recharge the pods and case almost daily.  that my be normal but I'm used to my BLUETOOTH earpiece and it last 10 hours!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nothing compares.  I especially love the noise canceling.  The box has it's own charge and can charge the headsets several times before you have to plug it back into the wall.  Essentially you can carry them all day and use them several times.
"
BGraham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My Apple air pods can brand new in box undamaged wrapped in plastic with a charging cord ( you do not get the block) I’m ok with that I have a MacBook Pro. The air pod Pros have great sound love the noise cancellation, they fit perfect in my ears, I really liked that they come with additional tips. I highly recommend buying if you are looking for wireless earbuds. They are so very easy to set up and connect to your iPhone even the Apple Care sets it self up when you connect your Apple air pods so your iPhone. Very easy!
"
BRIAN SLOAN,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are awesome.  We have three pairs in the house and everyone loves them.  I was skeptical about the cost and the fact that I have lost several cheap versions but I’ve had mine almost two years.  The “hear through “ feature is outstanding when exercising outside.
"
StickyMsgs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first AirPods. I have Jabra 2 and those were great as well. Noise cancellation and conversation features are great. Although I hope there’s an option to choose adjust the volume. Fits my ear canal and snug fit. Good bass and sound

  The size of the ninth generation iPad remains the same as before. The thickness is thick.but system update is very smooth. The most important thing is that the battery capacity is small. It need to be recharged every day.inconvenient.

  Are they worth 550? If you have an iPhone yes. Android or anything else, maybe not. The iPhone will give you audio editing/tuning options that you will not find elsewhere. On the iPhone make sure you are updated to the latest iOS that help the phone truly recognize the headphones, and then update the firmware of the headset itself. I consider myself an audiophile, and when I try new headphones, the sound test I put them through is fairly simple, and I play 5 key songs of different genres that I would say have “hidden sounds” or instruments that cheaper headphones would not catch. These pass the test, and surpass the Bose and Sony headsets in separating instruments, the “soundstage” effect. If you are a person who can’t tell the difference in good headphones versus others, don’t waste your time, because you won’t be able to justify the reasoning for the pricing. The comfort is amazing, and I can wear these for 4 hours plus with no discomfort. They look great, and noise cancellation is amazing on these headphones.

Ambrose,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had actually just recently bought the latest Sony noise canceling over ear phones when these came out. Because I am a big Apple user and have been happy with the AirPods Pro, I figured I wanted to give these a shot.,Pros,- Build quality - nothing beats it. The metal makes a big difference. Am curious how well the mesh will hold up. And the earpads are easily replaceable, so I expect long life.,- Looks - try as I might, I always felt the Sony phones looked too big and bulky, and often they would not sit evenly without some effort. And they are just plain black plastic. I'm not trying to win a beauty pageant, but I prefer how these look for Zoom calls. :),- Knob - OMG, I LOVE the knob/button (similar to the crown on the watch). It is soo much nicer having a physical control to turn the volume up and down, as well as easily pause and play. One thing I kinda hated about the Sony (I had an older model as well as the more recent) is how stupid easy it was to accidentally trigger their touch controls. Also, sometimes swipe up/down was interpreted as forward/back. Just not good. But the knob is way better and far harder to accidentally use.,- Sound Quality - I'm not a crazy audiophile, but I am one. These are just better sounding out of the box for sure. Very clear on mids and highs. Not muddy on lows but enough punch unless you are a bass head, maybe. I like bass, but not too much on headsets as it quickly becomes tiresome. These do a find job of finding the right balance for most types of music w/o touching the EQ. And in fact, I find most of the EQ changes sounded worse than better.,- Ease of Switching - I admit the latest Sony's made it relatively easy with their app. But pairing and switching between (Apple) devices is almost seamless and pretty near impossible to beat given their special support for their own headsets. Every so often, I have to manually tell it to use these, but most of the time it switches smartly. Sometimes, though, I don't want it to switch over when it does, but no big deal.,- Sharing Audio - not technically specific to these, but it's pretty slick to share audio on the Apple TV, so my wife and I can watch and listen w/o disturbing the sleeping little one across the hall.,- Pause/Resume - specifically when taking them off and putting them on. Very responsive and works almost perfectly.,- Spatial Audio - I first noticed this on my AirPods Pro. I kind of couldn't believe my ears. It's a neat effect. I hope they add it for Apple TV.,Meh/OK,- Noise Canceling - It handles a lot of the more obvious white/pink type noise, but it could do better with things like kids yelling in the background. I want to say the Sonys are a bit better on this.,- Standby Battery Use - I do not understand why yet, but when I just hang them on my headphone holder on my desk, they drain relatively quickly while not in use. Supposedly Apple claims they should go into low power mode without putting them in their case, but I'm not convinced. I think they should essentially lose no power when not in use, but they do.  Playback is fine/good as other options, so far as I can tell, though.,Cons,- Price - obviously. I've bought various sets for around $3-400 in the past. So these are by a good bit the most expensive set I've owned. But for all the Pros above, I think it is justified--especially if you are heavily in the Apple device ecosystem.,- Case - everybody hates it. I don't personally care cuz I only use these at home, but if I had to use that thing a lot, I think I'd not be happy with it.,In Brief,I think these are a great headset, especially for Apple folks. I sold my Sonys in favor of these. If you care about the Pros listed above, and you can afford (or want to afford) it, definitely go with these, as of now.

  They do compete with the Bose and Sony $300-400 offerings - the extra $200 is strictly for the brand. Which the logo would be nice to have on the product since you pay soooooooooo much for it. So the ANC is both qualitatively and quantitively lesser than Bose - it blocks out not as much and has a quality to it that exacerbates the ""pressure in my ears"" feeling. The transparency mode is class leading though, have to give them that. They're pretty comfortable, though when the ear pads rub together, the sound and feeling make me want to die. And finally, the sound is mostly sub-par - nice around mid-low and bass,  contemptible at mid high; all else is unremarkable. If you want audiophile, buy real headphones and if you want ANC, spend much less on better products.

Ian D.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I see people raving up and down about the perfection and wonderfulness of these headphones; I’m not as completely blown away by them as those people are. Quality of construction does seem to be excellent (although because Amazon doesn’t lower all prices at the start of Prime Day but only lowers some of them well after Prime Day has begun, I had to send back the first pair I bought and purchase another pair to get a discounted price, and the piston things for extending and compressing the size of the headphones was smoother on the first pair I had) and they’re comfortable enough to wear for extended periods, but while it may be a limitation of Bluetooth (I don’t know), I haven’t noticed myself being amazed by their bass response. No, in fact I just now watched the video for Shake It Off and listened to a couple of Lana Del Rey tracks and these headphones are definitely lacking in bass response – as in, there’s very little, and what there is gets completely lost under any midrange and high-end sounds that may be playing at the same time. They’re tinny-sounding. I have to wonder what the people are listening to with these who are praising the sound quality so enthusiastically.,On the other hand, I don’t ordinarily listen to music anymore, but only to talks and lectures; While I’m watching movies is probably the only time I’m going to really want big bass, and I watched The Revenant last night and didn’t feel like I was missing anything…,So their construction is much more solid than that of probably most other headphones on the market, they’re comfortable to wear, and there’s a nice ecosystem of accessories out there, but I personally find the sound quality quite lacking and I’m going to have to decide whether to hang onto these or return them.

B. W.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Overall these things are amazing. Battery life is great, transparency mode is amazing, isolation mode is jaw dropping, and sound quality is very impressive for Bluetooth. Buttons are excellent and controls are intuitive and accurate.,Things I don't like:,Occasionally, they just won't connect correctly or turn on, I have to do various button combinations until it decides to turn on and connect.,Sometimes while charging and listening, there's a horribly loud sound squealing/hissing out of the right side right into your ear, also happens when pressing any buttons that cause a sound to be generated. Almost painfully loud!,I'll be contacting Apple support about this.,Edit 7/15/21:,I dropped the headphones off at my local apple store on 7/2/21 before the holiday weekend in an effort to get them in for repair as quickly as possible, but apparently they got lost and magically found again on 7/14/21.

  The AirPods max sync perfectly with my iOS devices. I got mine in space gray and they look and feel amazing. The obvious question you may be asking is, is it worth the price? And honestly, if you can comfortably afford it, yes! I am not an audiophile by any means but I have listened to my fair share of headphones, and these are at the top of the ones I would consider to not be audiophile quality. The noise canceling is superb and the battery does not drain once they’ve been left alone for 5 minutes.

StephanieL,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  What I liked the connectivity with Apple products was great. I did not find the sound quality exceptional for the cost of the headphones although I do use them I found them extremely heavy about twice as heavy as the Bose headphones I used prior. If you don't mind a really heavy set of headphones maybe these are for you but I would recommend the lighter Bose headphones.

  I'm losing my vision, so sound has become more and more important for creative stimulation. No joke, these AirPods Max were a bit much on the wallet, but it's been a long time since I've experienced so much satisfaction from an extravagant purchase. I've owned decent quality bluetooth ear buds & headphones, and I've listened to ultra high end headphones with a dedicated amp that were WAY outside my budget reality. At a certain price point, the performance curve of audio equipment tapers off and it becomes an escalating expression of gaudy esthetics. Like most Apple products, the AP Max's have an attention to detail that transcends the market. Their simple ergonomic design, surface textures and materials feel like $550 worth in a way I didn't expect. These aren't the disposable electronic design I'm used to, but harken back to the expectation of quality and design of the past. The weight of these phones is significant but well distributed over the mesh rest and ear pads. I'm not going to say it isn't noticeable, but it's pleasantly reassuring to be reminded I have something special on your ears. Truthfully though, the tactile part is a distant second to the sound quality of these headphones.,Driving your new Ferrari for the first time, you won't likely find satisfaction on a dirt road. That said, to get a sense of what the Aripod Max are really capable of, steer clear of the streaming Mp3 dirt road and open them up the best mastered music you can find. I used the 24bit mastered album Point by Yello for this, and the 2021 collection of bineural 8D Audio recordings by 8D Tunes. I thought I'd heard these recordings, but my AP Max's reproduced a whole new range of dimension and detail.,I've played with different settings listening to the same song and turning the noise canceling mode off does produce a slightly higher level of depth and detail. The design quality, sound reproduction, and  noise canceling of the Max's is better than the Bose I got my Dad for his B-day. I understand total sound isolation would be dangerous, but Apple still has room for improvement there IMHO. The transparent mode on the other hand is nothing shore of holy crap remarkable. Very natural sound like taking the headphones off with a button. I don't know if it denigrates any sound quality, but I admit I like to turn on the extended bass in the sound settings of my MacBook and iPhone.,Thanks Allie, I'm more than satisfied.

mmp1953,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Having had the opportunity to own most if not all of the big guns, Sony WH10003 and 4, Bose 700 and currently living with Apple AirPods Max and Shure Aonic 50. I do have wired Shure  SRH1540 and 1840 used with a HiBy FC3.,Now, the AirPods Max are definitely to my ears one of the best at reproducing or presenting music the way I like it. I think this is where sometimes things can get a little off track. This is my preference and to my ears these things present a huge sound stage, almost on a spooky level. Hence my title question. They just have such a full and rich presentation and from the top to the very bottom these rock!,I could never get into any version of the Sony WH1000 and after a couple pair of those I gave up. The Bose 700 I found to be very good to my ears but the annoying voice if I made a change to noise cancelling it would pause my music and for some reason it happened more often than not because my fingers couldn't stay away from the buttons, whenever I adjusted the headset I would activate something (my bad) but I still liked them a lot and kept them until I tried the AAP Max's. The Shure Aonic 50's I've decided to keep as well because these things deserve a listen too.,The price is not right for these things, too too expensive but I have to admit compared to every other headset I've had the AAP Max's put them to shame with the premium feel.,I like every aspect of this headphone and could complain about not having the ability to turn them off, or the dumb ""Bra"" you have to use to put them in low power mode and whatever else other people are not liking. But when i use them  I forget about all those things because what these do, they do it well. Even the ""Crown"" knob, for me it works great and for some reason I naturally turn it in the correct direction for my purpose.,There are definitely other notable BT headphones I've owned but the Bose 700 are now gone, my open back Shure's are gone (I have so Sennhieser 700 in stash and some AudioTechnica things) and my HiBy and closed back Shure's now see less duty because things aren't getting any more clear and defined pleasing, and just darn right enjoyable without the wires.,Your mileage will I'm sure vary...

  You can buy a head set of the same quality for a max of $150. This is a dumb wasteful buy. Apple is junk. Stupid expensive for no reason but the name. Its greed. DONT BUY THIS. But razor, or hell even bose. There so many that are cheaper and better all around.

Joseph Ricci,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these headphones about 7 months ago. Initially, they worked flawlessly with both my iPhone XS and iPad Air (4th gen); was able to connect instantly via Bluetooth and had no issues switching between iPad and iPhone audio/microphone control on demand. Sound quality and noise cancellation is great. However, it has gotten to the point where I need to hard re-boot these headphones almost every other day in order to get them to connect with my iPhone & iPad. For a ~$500 pair of apple headphones interfacing with other Apple products, this should be UNACCEPTABLE. If you are planning on spending this much money on a set of Bluetooth headphones, look elsewhere.

  The headphones are fantastic although I’m not sure if it was worth the repo man coming to repo my car after I wasn’t able to afford my car payment when I bought these headphones from Apple.

"
DRx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound is flipping phenomenal...hearing nuances I've never heard before in music I've been listening to for decades. Coming from a pair of Sony XB900's which has great sound, but not as good as the APMax.  Lows, mids, highs...they all deliver...no lack of bass, nor is it over powering. Noise cancelling is second to none and the spatial is the bomb.,The ability to seamlessly switch between devices is awesome and is what eventually pushed me to order them.  If you're not invested in the Apple ecosystem then these ""may"" not be for you.  My Sony's were a PITA to switch between and have to be manually paired when switching every time.  They connect and disconnect just like the regular Airpods.,These are built to last, look and feel great.  They feel heavy in your hands but are comfortable when put on and don't feel heavy when being worn.  Charging cable is Lightning to USB3/TB3, so if you have a Mac computer you can charge from a Thunderbolt port.  Or if you have an iPhone you can use the USB to lightning that came with your phone, it just won't charge quite as fast.,If you have the means to pick these up, don't be dissuaded by poor (lame) reviews from nimrods who aren't verified buyers. Trolls gonna troll.,Deduct 1/2 star for the relatively lame case and higher price, but round it up to a 5 star AMZ rating.  Would buy them again and couldn't imagine going back to the Sony's.
"
Sun,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The biggest problem with these is they are very heavy and made my ears sweat badly after an hour of using. I wish I would have kept the Bose 45 instead but sent those back and got these hoping that I could hear voices and neither set was very good with letting in outside sounds the AirPods Pro buds are better but they fall out often. I can’t win. These give me bad headaches to tight fitting I returned.
"
JayCook,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing feel, high quality comfort. Superb sound quality and comfort.,I did not want to spend the money for these but every time I put them on I am glad I did. I purchased these along with the Sony XM4 and the Bose 700 series noise cancelling headphones. I got them all at the same time with the intention of taking two of them back to the store. I wanted the XM4 to be the best because that was the cheapest of the three. After 1 week cycling through all three, I had to give the win to these with Bose coming in second and Sony in last place. I will not bore you with all the details so here is a quick rundown of all three.,Apple Air Pods Max- Not only did I enjoy the clarity of the sound but they were by far the most comfortable of all three which I found odd because they are quite a bit heavier than the other two. I could wear these for hours without feeling any kind of strain. The metal and fabrics used in these are top notch and give you the feeling of quality when wearing and handling them. The magnetic ear cups also just pop off if you ever need to replace them.,Bose 700 Series- Also very comfortable but I found the sound a little thin and not as full as the AirPods Max. Otherwise these were also very good. My issue/complaint is from past headphones of Bose where the ear pad material starts to flake off after 8 months to a year.,Sony XM4- Last place, not as thin sounding as the Bose but the bass was enhanced to the point of being too much for different styles of music. I think if all you listen to is Hip-Hop/Rap, etc you might not mind them all too much. My main complaint with these is they felt and looked cheap, almost toylike in your hands. Very plasticky and also had me questioning the ear cup material. Another issue I had with these was switching from my phone to my computer had to be done through an app on my phone through Sony. Very cumbersome.,All in all, after almost 1 month in and buying them in the Apple store at full price, I am still smiling every time I put them on. If you can get them at the current Amazon price of $479 than that's even better. The initial financial hit hurts but if you love music and need something that works well for extended time then you can't go wrong with these.

Ed K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm one day into ownership, having bought an AirPods Max sight unseen.  I saw the box at a Best Buy, but the few they had in stock were all under lock and key.  Is it heavy?  Yes, definitely, but I am in that adjustment period where the weight is being mentally depreciated on my AirPod balance sheet.,There is an additional issue with weight for those of us who are bald or thinning on top.  It is easier for our unbelievably pricey device to feel like it is going to slide around a bit.  I have found that, when outside, wearing a baseball cap diminishes that issue greatly. A cap serves, in effect, as a hair substitute.  My indoor use of these earphones should not be visualized as slipping and sliding as much as a fear of slipping and sliding.  Perhaps it is my imagination, but I am getting the feeling the earphones are adjusting to my head.  Why shouldn't they for the megabucks they cost?,The audio is excellent (but not significantly better than my wired Bose QC15's), and the build is outstanding.  All the things said about easily incorporating the AirPods into an owner's Apple universe are true--effortless even for a clueless user like me.,Would I have bought the AirPods Max if I had been able to try it on, even if just to see how it felt?  Probably not.  The weight would have scared me off, and it never feels heavier than when you first wear it.  Will I come to love it as time passes?  I am guessing yes.,It just seems to me there is a material out there that could have been used in place of the aluminum  earphones that would lighten the load.  Would carbon fiber work?  For what these cost, it does not seem any material would be too expensive as an aluminum substitute.,Addendum from week or so later:  I have accommodated to the weight of the earphones.  Of course they remain heavy, but I have become accustomed to the heaviness.  The sound remains excellent and the price remains excessive.  I get a bit of ear soreness on one side because the cup seems to be slightly too narrow, but I have touchy ears so that is not only bearable but expected, no matter the brand.  Having had my few days of AirPods Max experience, would I purchase them again?  Probably not because their outstanding build means they will outlast my interest in them as new models with new features arrive from Apple and others, but it is a close call because I live in the Apple Universe.  In sum, I might take a different path if given the chance for a re-do, but my purchase decision is bittersweet, and not so bitter that I harbor buyer's remorse.

Truthful Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I took a chance and purchased the Air Pods Max because I’m a big fan of noise cancelling headphones and already own the Sony XM4 and the Bose QC35.,Note: I used to own the Bose 700 but returned them because the head band was so tight it gave me headaches and I couldn’t wear it for more than 20-30 minutes.,Here is my experience with each.,Best Noise Cancelling:,  Air Pods Max,  Sony XM4,  Bose QC35,I use all 3 headphones with televisions in the background, small children and outdoors. The Air Pods Max is very close to the XM4, I would rate it as a 10% difference – it’s almost tied. The QC35 on the other hand, I can hear faint television/small children in the background, even at high volume.,Long Term Comfort:,  Bose QC35,  Air Pods Max,  Sony XM4,Nothing will ever beat the QC35’s. I can wear them all day and take video and phone calls however, it does give me a slight disorientation effect and minor vertigo, similar to diving or moving to an elevated height (driving up a mountain for example).,The Air Pods Max are comfortable, and the ear cups surround my large ears just like the QC35 however, there the clamp is noticeable – this may go away after some time; the clamp causes minor discomfort with glasses; I removed my glasses for the purpose of this short review and the discomfort has faded, even after 60 minutes of listening – it does clamp more than the QC35 and XM4s.,Something to keep in mind is the XM4 earpads are not thick enough and my ear brushes against the speaker area; this also makes my ears get hot after 30 minutes and I eventually have to take a short break – this does not happen with the Air Pods Max – there is lots of room for my ears and the cushions are thick enough that my ears do not touch the speaker area.,Microphone:,  Air Pods Max,  Bose QC35,  Sony XM4,I completed several zoom video/audio calls, Facetime and regular calls. I asked my friends/family to compare my voice quality on each headset and every time, the Air Pods Max was the winner. Bose QC35 is still great in this department however – I was using them as my primary driver for calls prior to getting the Air Pods Max.,The Sony XM4’s are below average; people cannot hear me clearly. In-fact, I stopped using them entirely for business calls because colleagues would make remarks about my microphone. They are ‘okay’ for personal calls, but not desirable for me at least.,Synchronization:,  Air Pods Max,  Bose QC 35,  Sony XM4,I place the Air Pods on my head and it immediately connects to my phone. I do not have to touch anything on either of my devices. When I place the Air Pods Max around my neck or left one ear cup, the music pauses. When I place both ear cups back on my ears, the music auto resumes. I tested this for several hours and it has never failed.,As for the Bose QC35 and XM4’s, no matter if they both have multi device pairing, I am always having issues. Both headsets never switch to my other device without me having to manually disconnect 1 of 2 devices (the one I’m not using). This is frustrating and I hate doing this multiple times per day.,Music Quality:,  Air Pods Max,  Sony XM4,  Bose QC35,The Air Pods Max I would rate have 30% better music quality than the XM4. I tested Hip-Hop, Bossa Nova, Jazz, Classical, Deep House, D&B, Techno, Trip Hop, Dubstep and Lounge. The must is more engaging, and I can hear the instruments and vocals in more detail – an elevated musical experience. The biggest difference for me was Jazz, Classical, Bossa Nova and Salsa – I would say a 50% better listening experience for these genres.,Build Quality:,  Air Pods Max,  Sony XM4,  Bose QC35,Air Pods Max are easily the highest quality headphones I have handled; they look at and feel premium and are crafted exceptionally well – even the buttons are strong and durable; these are basically on another level entirely. When extending the headphones, there is a steel connector with resistance when adjusting the sizing to fit your head properly.,The XM4/QC35 are hard plastic – nothing special or extravagant; the XM4 look better than the QC35 however.,Spatial Audio Note:,I was completely blown away when I loaded an Apple TV series on my phone to test the spatial audio feature. It felt like I had speakers surround me in a 360 fashion at the move theatres. I stood there for 5 minutes with my eyes wide opened in disbelief that headphones were capable of offering this level of experience. It is something that you have to try it to believe it. This is what sold me the most.,---,Are the Air Pods Max worth the price? Based on my experience so far, I would say yes. I was actually expecting them to be close to the XM4’s, but on certain categories, they have accelerated immensely.

   Como todo lo que hace Apple, estos audífonos no son la excepción. Los materiales son de muy alta calidad (al menos así se percibe desde que abres la caja). Solo la caja la podrías vender en mil pesos.,He visto reseñas que por la mitad de precio podrías conseguir algo de igual o mejor calidad, puede ser, pero dudo que superen la interfaz de usuario que Apple logró con estos. Acercas los audífonos al teléfono y listo. Yo no soy audiófilo, por eso puedo decir que por mucho supera a mis anteriores audífonos (Marshall II),El modo ambiental es super pro, es como si se modulara el ruido exterior y llegara a tus oídos una onda de sonido perfectamente modulada.

roger b. schroeder,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch would never ring or vibrate on incoming call, talked to at least 6 advisers and 3 were senior advisers. None ever made a promised callback or offered any solution. I had to return the watch to Amazon for a refund.

  Hi I just received my Apple Watch but I’m upset that it was missing the plug to charge the watch. I payed 300 dollars and things were missing and now I just had to spent 12 dollars to get the plug and now it won’t come in until one day before Christmas Eve. Ugh

"
Keegan ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch is great so far. But I can’t believe how cheap Apple is to not even put in a charging adapter. When your paying over $400 dollars and you get a watch you can’t even charge and then you have to go out and buy a $20 dollar adapter it’s ridiculous.
"
Maribel Butten,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Everything was perfect, but apple man, I forgot they never bring in Power Adapters with their products. Just a quick little reminder, most if not all apple products (including this) will not bring a Power Adapter and you have to buy one yourself

Gabrielle A. Perez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They have two sizes for the bands inside the box, medium/large and small. I liked this concept better because I could never find a band that would fit my wrist. The screen is bigger than the previous generation, and the keyboard is a nice touch when texting.

"
Gregory Hoffman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The product was a Christmas gift & came defective, unverified by the seller. Returns only done through 3 day ground ship to seller, 8 days later, still waiting for refund. I don't recommend Apple products through Amazon as long as products remain unverified by the seller & returns are not done through walk-in centers or through local apple retailers.
"
Suman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No power adapter. I don't have one, so returned the watch. Isn't it unfair trade practice to sell a product that can't be functional.  FTC are you hearing?,I went for Fitbit Charge5 which is way better than Apple Watch. Charge 5 got all the features, if not the most important features - heart beat, sleep, SPO2, ECG, EDA, notifications etc. Its inexpensive so not to worry to about watching the watch. Great charge5.
"

"
Mustafa Nawab,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s the best AirPods can get especially with a discounted price, but there should be more sizes like a size between medium and small because they want to kind of come out every time and medium is too big for my ears. The base is a little weak and the noise cancellation is just OK but overall it’s a great in your headphones. Could use some more color variations.
"
STG,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality and sound cancellation was outstanding.  I did not care for the shorter stubs as it is too hard to adjust the buds in your ear without accidentally cutting off phone calls.,Will be swapping them for second generation  ear buds.
"

  Have avoided the Apple Watch because of inaccurate heart rate readings from the wrist when exercising.  But the series 7 pairs with the Polar H10 chest strap for very accurate readings.

  While the product is excellent I was greatly disappointed to see the same product with a different colored band for sake on Amazon for $50 less AND it included the watch charging device which I had to buy separately after my watch arrived without one. Poor customer relationship marketing. 🙁
"
Garry C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
DJ179,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought the new Series 7 watch after having a Fitbit Sense - Fitbit is complete garbage compared to the Apple Watch, not writing that as an Apple fan boy, just stating a fact coming from having the Fitbit Versa 2 and then the Sense, would never buy a Fitbit again, Apple Watch light years better by comparison, very happy with it!
"
J Herr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Honestly the battery doesn’t last long compared to a series 3 with the raise to wake turned off. But having the watch charge super fast does somewhat make up for it.

  If you don’t have an Apple Watch or are thinking of upgrading then do it thank me later you won’t regret it! Yes I am aggravated like everyone else that there is not a adapter included and if you don’t have a USB-C 20 adapter you will need to get one make sure it’s from Apple and enjoy the super fast charging that won’t damage the battery.

"
AG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love this new iPad Air. It is very light, beautiful, and easy to use.,I’ve a good desktop, but I wanted something portable for watching video and reading books. My phone has too small of a screen sometime. I’ve tried multiple devices: dual screen android phones, folding phones, android tablet, chrome tablet/laptop and the iPad always comes out ahead. The iPad Pro is amazing, but very expensive. I felt bad spending a thousand dollars for a device I was using just for fun. That’s where the iPad Air comes in. I got a great deal from Amazon warehouse. It’s like new, no scratches or anything. I’ve lost s bit of warranty, but there was a 25% discount on retail price, so I can’t complain.

k,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  been waiting so long for this, finally happy to get my hands on it. it’s an amazing tablet for those looking for budget friendly compared to the high end models such as the pros. I got the 64gb version, as the 256gb would’ve made the price closer to a ipad pro 11 inch, and thus rendered the ipad air a poor choice. Can easily buy a portable ssd for less and have more storage. Definitely recommend!!!
"
rob559,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A big upgrade from an iPad 2, which was practically unusable. The speed, screen, weight - everything about this is fantastic. It's nice to get back to using an iPad again and seeing how much has changed since iOS 9 which was what my old iPad could run on. If you haven't updated your old iPad or are thinking about getting your first, this is a great piece of tech!!
"
Junior_Mint,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It does what you think it does.  You pay extra for more speed and a bigger screen, but the bottom-most part of the screen has this annoying ""home"" bar.  It doesn't disappear in safari or in many apps, and it is often quite distracting.,I was also drawn in by the green back, which I have not seen since the day the ipad was delivered and likely never again will.
"
DavidH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Have a iPad Pro, not the latest model, and the Air with the new chip is noticeably faster. Screen quality is awesome. The new charging connector is a bit inconvenient. Have an iPhone and 2 other iPads so there is a charger, for them, in most every room. Will prob replace my iPad Pro with the larger one with the new chip when it comes out.

  I ordered the ipad air with an after Christmas delivery date, was happy to have it show up on the 23rd. The box was in good condition but after the ipad box itself was opened on Christmas it was found to have no charging cord or block so it can't be charged.  If I return it there are non to replace it with. This was supposed to be a new ipad, but make me wonder if it truly was.

  If you’re an artist and love to draw digitally, spend the money, I never thought I would leave photoshop until they started charging $30 a month and I knew I had to try something different. I bought the iPad for procreate and it’s amazing, does so many things better and more intuitively than photoshop with a one time $12 fee. It’s a no brainer. Of course it’s amazing for games and shows and other things as well. Nice to have on a deployment that’s for sure!!
"
Melissa Torres,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
wolfboy001,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Still the best tablet there is.  Love the iPad.  Easy to use, secure, reliable, long battery life, and lightweight.  Apple Pencil is game changing for art/drawing and even note taking isn't too bad.  Tech needs some polish still, but nothing else compares.

  The best iPad for normal everyday use, even for virtual meetings! Love the new bezel, making viewing videos or zoom much more pleasurable. Location of the front camera is not really an issue as you can easily adjust your position to suit your style. The volume is top notch, and the best thing it can be used with Apple Magic Keyboard, which is the best keyboard for a tablet.

Katie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I do like this Air Pad its new to me but I have had a tablet before. Nothing really new just the speed, color, the picture is a lot clearer. I never thought about a color on my tablet before its different but not to extreme. It works well for the things I need to do. I didn’t expect the size to be close to the IPad Pro but that’s ok i am getting used to it and plus my husband likes to play on it at times.
"
Marty Rogers,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the best overall tablet for everyday use. I have never been a laptop or desktop computer user, and smartphone screens are just too small for constant access to the Internet. There are numerous advantages while using a tablet as a home, or mobile device. My device is loaded with a very impressive graphics/photo editing app.,Emails, social media, contact information management, photos, graphic designs, travel, weather conditions, and online shopping are all available for quick and easy access. The iPad Air 4, is a serious computer device for anyone who needs an easily manageable platform for work and entertainment use.
"

  Frustrating!  My accounts transferred from my other iPad.  They should work? wrong.  When  you come back to get into one of your accounts you have issues getting in. Im having to  uninstall them one by one and reinstall.  Updates didn’t even work.beware the WiFi antenna is weak.
"
GO,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nicely designed and powerful but made for right handed people as pen gets in the way of holding the tablet with the right hand or the power button can be put on the bottom. Colors are so muted they are practically non-existent. Sound quality excellent. OS needs work as it is somewhere between IOS and MacOS.
"
William Flanagan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Apple gives a cable type usb c to charge the watch, but not the power adapter. Unless you already have one such, you can't charge and use this apple watch after paying  $300+. You need to buy 3rd party product to charge this watch. Not expected from Apple.

pj hinton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My old iPad Air just up and died, so had no choice but to replace it - and my goodness, wish it had died sooner!!!  This new baby is just so much better and oh so pretty in that new sky blue color!!  Takes a little getting used to, but then, all new things do!  It's a dream to use!!
"
FPC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Picture quality is simply outstanding.  Takes awhile to get used to the new functionality like the absent of home button, but once you adjust its great.  The battery life is great but they keep changing the plug so the cords and te cube are no longer compatible with IPHONE, unless you have a new one.
"
Josh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased this iPad for my mother. She is confined to a bed and was struggling to stay entertained with an old Kindle Fire. This screen is larger and better quality. The accessibility options are top notch. The battery lasts longer than we had expected. I cannot think of a better item to have given her at this time.
"
Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The Apple store didn’t have the color I wanted by the date I needed it so I was pleasantly surprised I could get it here. It came in perfect condition brand new as advertised. I was able to get it quickly with prime just a great experience.
"
Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is an upgrade from my iPad Air 2.  I like the bigger screen, but with case it’s bulkier and heavier.  I may need to get used to this size, other than that, it’s an apple, works great, faster than previous model.  Top tablet in the market.
"
Andrew M Field,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Hairline fracture has developed on the screen, Too bad. There was no insult to the device. Obviously not covered on the warranty and fixing it is same cost as a new one.,Big problem that outweighs all the positives about this product.
"
My honest opinion,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When the original iPad came out I told my friends this is the future of computers and immediately one says in an annoyed way “why?!” And I replied “have you used it?”, It functions exactly how you think it should, that by it self is amazing and it has only improved.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love my new Ipad, the screen is big enough to work on my design projects and it is lightweight!!!! really light weigth, I mean I had an Ipad Mini and this one is lighter than that one! Packaging was flawless as always and the Ipad came in perfect conditions. Head's up, you'll need wireless earphones to listen to music if you don't want to bother those around or are in a meeting. The sound is great, really loud if needed and quiet if you wanted, clear and no interruption. Recommend 100%

"
Kingsley Jephter,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nice one, but the battery drains once it is not being charged (whether it is worn or not). Thus, it has to be continuously charged 24/7. Not a good one.

  This unit was reported lost to Apple.  I purchased this device for my daughter for Christmas, I have just made the first payment.  While traveling to visit us, my daughter forgot this on the American Airlines plane.  We reported this unit lost and contacted the airline, but to no avail.  I hope that who ever has this unit will enjoy it.  I will finish paying this for the rest of the year, and will purchase another one once we are done paying for it.  In the mean time I am sure it was an excellent product.
"
zisme,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had to upgrade because my old iPad’s OS wouldn’t go past 12. I was running out of memory and the battery had reached the end of its life. This one came with the newest OS, 64 Gb of memory, faster processors and a bigger, higher definition screen. The battery life is also amazing.

Para el trabajo es muy útil ya que permite visualizar dos archivos al tiempo. El iPad viene con su cargador en caja y sellado, la entrega fue rápida.
"
Indira,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm a huge display enthusiast and I deeply regret not going for the Samsung S7+ , I have heard great reviews about this ipad so I decided to buy it due to longevity which matters to me. I'll say that the sleek metal frame feels amazing in my hands , speakers are ok , set up was ok as well , not as user friendly for someone new to the iOS environment. Overpriced ? Yes , I can't say I will return to another apple product,  not until the display is changed to OLED.
"
Terry Sharp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My wife has an original iPad Air that she has loved a great deal and uses it a lot. It was time to update to a newer one so we purchased this iPad Air 4, 64gb. She is slowly figuring out how it works without the home button, (not technological at all), and really seems to love it. Now to reset her old one so that I can teach my elderly aunt on how to use an iPad so that we can be in closer contact due to Covid.
"
Esmeralda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Franklin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Best middle ground if you want an iPad for light to moderate work, but don’t plan on ditching your Mac. I do think adding the magic keyboard takes it to the next level but even on its own the Air is great, the battery lasts, and it’s really light (hence the Air). 10/10 would buy again (I’m not but you know ;) ).
"

QuiltingIsMyPassion,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought my first iPad Air when they first came out. This is my third one. I prefer the Air because of it's smaller size and the lightness of feel in my hands. Am very satisfied with this 4th generation device. Do wish the battery would last a bit longer as I use it hours at  time for reading.
"
Chopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

Keegan ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch is great so far. But I can’t believe how cheap Apple is to not even put in a charging adapter. When your paying over $400 dollars and you get a watch you can’t even charge and then you have to go out and buy a $20 dollar adapter it’s ridiculous.
"
Maribel Butten,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Everything was perfect, but apple man, I forgot they never bring in Power Adapters with their products. Just a quick little reminder, most if not all apple products (including this) will not bring a Power Adapter and you have to buy one yourself

"
Nathaniel Pennington,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It has a decent screen quality, Apple always delivers good screens so that’s to be expected, the battery life is okay, but I’ve had it for a few days so I’m unsure of longevity, should be good due to the A14 Bionic though. It is very responsive and smooth, but if you are used to a 120 Hz refresh rate, it might seem a little choppy but it still is smooth even then. The 64 GB base version (which I have) should be enough as long as you have other sources of storage ex: an external hard drive. Other then that, as a consumer product. It works!
"
Jerry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am a University student and I needed an iPad so I can take notes during lectures, and for some minor work stuff, I can say after using it for a couple months with the magic keyboard it is well worth the money, however I must say that even with the magic keyboard I do not recommend it to be you only “laptop”

As for everyday use, I just don't have a large use for it. The iPad though is a great purchase and a great bang for your buck. Couldn't recommend more!

  I really like this iPad Air 4th generation. I was initially hesitant about getting only 64gb but so far I’ve been able to keep up with the amount of storage being used. I mostly use it for streaming so 64 is just fine. I like how it paired up with my iPhone so I can answer texts or calls from either the iPad or iPhone. This iPad so far has worked very smoothly which is my typical apple experience. Very happy with this purchase.

  Macs use to be quite a great computer, however, this computer tends to crash with certain programs (adobe and blender.) No ports for SD cards, or USB. (I bought numerous external ports (spent at least $60 on numerous devices) and still I am always forgetting them. I would at least love this feature to come back and/or will to pay extra for this feature.  This is probably fine for most users but for anyone working with arts, graphics and using different programs etc. this is a real inconvenience. Mac has continued to make its products less compatible with other computer brands.. Overall this will be my last MacBook, the drop and drag, and numerous features that made this a great computer and easy to use, were awesome but are no longer worth it. Oh yeah, also I lost numerous movies that I had purchased off of my iTunes, I contacted the iTunes customer service and no help.  Pretty much I am sad, and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules, like not only needing memory space on the computer (which mine is not full) but my icloud is full, after only 5 or 7 months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop.  So I watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless, and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them. So now I changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and I can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop. Apple has been a throne inside and I caution those who are working on arts, coding etc. to save the stress and frustration and stray away. This computer is pretty much an iPad for people that don't want ipads...

Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First off, let me say, I'm speaking as a tech enthusiast with a decent understanding of gizmos and gadgets. I've owned Windows PCs, a MacBook Pro 2014, and a few Chromebooks. This is, by FAR, my favorite computer that I've ever used. Period. Let me start with my favorite aspects/features, in lovely bullet points for your viewing pleasure:,-Battery life. Oh my god. I have to TRY to kill this thing in one day. Full brightness, playing The Sims 3 or World of Warcraft, Spotify playing, Safari AND Chrome open in the background... I went from about 100% to 85% in an hour. And that's the most I could do. Usually, I start the day at full battery, then use it on and off all day, and the lowest I've gotten so far is ~40% by bedtime. It. Is. Insane. Not to mention the standby, which is basically 1-2% drop in a day. I cannot stress how amazed I am by the efficiency of this machine.,-Speakers. Okay, I know some people don't mind a tinny little laptop speaker because they use headphones. But I am not that person, I like to be able to just play music or videos out loud and enjoy them. Well, these speakers are also the BEST I've ever heard on a laptop. It's got such a full, defined, crisp sound, I can hear a lot more of the dynamic range and background effects than any other laptop I've used. It also gets LOUD, I can use it to fill my room with sound, and in fact I've had to turn it down a bit at night because my roomies down the hall can hear it. The bass is the only point that isn't a home run, but for what it's worth, I can definitely hear the bass. It just doesn't boom. Overall, amaaaazing!,-Keyboard. Short and sweet, this is my favorite keyboard. The previous spot was my 2014 MacBook Pro, but this surpasses that. The keys travel well, I make less mistakes, and it's quiet and comfortable. Not much else to say, it's just really good.,-Screen. Still a gorgeous Retina display, crisp, bright AF, colorful, and easy on the eyes thanks to True Tone. I'm not an artist or video editor, so this is just coming from an average consumer.,-Touch Bar. I know this is a divisive opinion, but I personally really like the Touch Bar! Some apps take advantage of it, and it really helps. Spotify keeps the controls on the bar, so I can switch and adjust music without having to switch back to the app. The sliders for brightness and volume are easy to press and slide, and frankly I just enjoy it. Touch ID on the corner is also LOVELY for logging in, making purchases, or filling forms out on webpages. One touch and you're good. Brilliant.,-Form factor. I love this skinny slab of aluminum. I'm a minimalist, and it just pleases me to hold and look at. This is completely subjective, but I'm a fan.,-Speed. Oh my god. This thing is legitimately the fastest computer that I've ever used. I'm honestly shook at how easily it handles anything I throw at it. It runs World of Warcraft on High settings at 60fps. No other MacBook could do that, the 8 core graphics chip really lives up to its specs. I can have tons of tabs open, a game, things updating in the background, and this guy doesn't break a sweat. All while absolutely SIPPING battery.,-Fans. Yes, the main difference between this and the M1 Air is that the Pro has an active cooling system. That being said, I've heard the fan come on about 3 times in 3 weeks. Even when running all that stuff I said before. I'm befuddled by how great the thermal dissipation works in this thing. It's good that it has fans, even if it barely uses them.,Less good but still aight:,-USB-C ports. Yes, there's only 2 on the left side. Yes, I had to buy an adapter for HDMI and USB-A. Am I mad about it? Not really, I only need to use those things when I'm docked at a desk anyway. I use a bluetooth mouse or the touchpad, and I have AirPods for headphones. So I don't need to plug many things in anyway. But if you do, definitely invest in an adapter. I use one by Anker, with 3 USB-A, an HDMI, and an ethernet port.,-To add to the USB-C impressions, I still miss MagSafe, so I actually purchased a ""magnetic"" USB-C cable, which you put the receiver in the MacBook USB port, and the cable magnetically attaches to it, just like the old MagSafe. This makes me feel safer, because a firm USB-C cable sticking out the side makes me nervous, if I were to drop it or hit it on something and mess up the port. Highly recommend a cable like this.,-Price. It's expensive, there's no way around that. But I'd consider it an investment, because generally speaking, Macs last many many years over their Windows counterparts. And since this is the first to use Apple silicon, I'm sure it will be supported for a long while.,-Webcam. It's just not great. The AI enhancements are definitely noticeable and make you look better, but at the end of the day, its a 720p webcam in a $1300+ computer. Come on apple, is 1080p that hard to add?,-App compatibility. While I have had almost no issues, some apps may not play nice with the M1 right now. The only real issues I had were that The Sims 2 Deluxe collection does not work, which I discovered is an issue for everyone with the M1 Macs. But luckily the devs say theyre working on a fix, so hopefully it's just a small number of apps with issues. Other than that, every other app has worked great.,Verdict: I love this computer. Sometimes I just sit and marvel at it. Sometimes I pick it up just to feel how nice it fits in my hands. It is legitimately my favorite computer, and if you're willing to make the investment, I think it's a fantastic computer for most people. If you don't need the Touch Bar or extra oomph from the fans, the M1 Air might be for you. But for me, man, the M1 MacBook Pro is THE laptop king. Or queen. 5 stars from me!,Update: I've had the MBP for about 2 months now, and I'm still completely in love with it. I stream on Twitch, and I can run OBS, a game like World of Warcraft, Spotify, Discord, Safari... all without a hiccup. The only real time I get the fans running is when I do this. I have seen the temperature of the cores spike to about 204 degrees Fahrenheit under load, but it's never shut down. It throttled once, as I noticed a slowdown, but I was running literally all those apps plus a discord video call, so I assume either the 8GB of ram couldn't handle it, or the cores got too hot. I was really pushing it though. Battery is still amazing, and I can run WoW Classic on max settings easily. Overall, still impressed, and still my favorite machine EVER!

  Let me start off the apple ecosystem is great but what really disappointed me after 2 months of use the screen starting getting bright spots along the bottom and left side and eventually turned into a mess of different colors rendering that part useless. I got a quote from apple for 755 dollars to fix the screen including parts and labor and a 2 month wait time. I also had major connectivity issues with usb products using apples adapter too. It seems as if apples quality has gone down hill lately and this has pushed me away from apple. This will be my last apple product I purchase sadly

book reader,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  On a positive note, keyboard problem has been solved. But new annoyances have been introduced. I'm back to transferring pictures by wire. Airdrop is too hit and miss, works, but barely. Internet search for solutions shows me I am not alone. I've been on for three hours now, charging, and I've gone from 13% to 9%. Sluggish connectivity with bluetooth and internet compared to my Macbook Air of 2018, sitting next to one another on the same wifi network. All kinds of little annoyances also with that bar on top. It is useless, but for sound you have to use it and it is more cumbersome than the simple old way. Overheats once a day. I wish I had not bought it. The screen quality is great and I have a TB of memory. But as far as speed and ease is concerned, this thing is a trip back in time, back to Steve Balmer's Microsoft and its contempt for consumers.

Nathan Hjelm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am still waiting on delivery of my 13"" Macbook Pro but have been running with an M1 Mac Mini (same processor). So far I am blown away (but not surprised) by the performance. For software development workloads the M1 is 2-3x faster than my 2019 Core i7 16"" Macbook Pro. A compile that takes ~6m on the MBP takes ~3 on the M1 Mac. Performance benchmarks with Open MPI are roughly 2-4x better for both latency and bandwidth. And this is before any additional optimization work.,For gaming I tested the M1 with a native build of World of Warcraft. The game was playable (30+ fps) at ultra (level 10) outputting 1440p on a 27"" display. The fans do spin up but you never hear them. The 16"" Macbook Pro has a AMD Radeon 560 and struggles to be playable at level 6 on the internal display. The Macbook pro also gets incredibly hot.,Tried a couple of older x86 Windows games (Portal 1 and 2 from Steam) with Crossover 20 and they were playable at high graphics. Very impressive given these are running under Rosetta 2.

  1- Connecting an iPhone/iPad will brick all apps that didn’t come preinstalled. I can no longer add music or audio books to my mobile device. No big deal, just cause I travel a lot why would that be an inconvenience.,2- Safari is hit and miss on playing videos (Had to install chrome to play online videos).  So much for not using google.,3- External monitor does not wake from sleep. Requires a restart. If I had known I was, going to have to restart my computer every time it goes to sleep I would have bought a Windows computer.,4- Most of my 3rd party apps are buggy. I expected that would be the case for a while.,5- Bluetooth is buggy, Generally takes several attempts to get something paired.,6- No card reader! really!!! Easy enough to add, but still.,I’ve always known that MacOS doesn’t play well with non apple products, now it doesn’t even play well with their own products.,I am totally disappointed in Apple's quality control.,I didn’t expect to spend $2000 on a computer and have to restart and trouble shoot just about every time I use it. If I could do it all over I would stick with the intel processor.

Pippi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this laptop in late January. By May, the display was suddenly filled with random lines and blocks. The Genius Bar assistant ran a test, found the laptop had no scratches, and promised that only the top case and display would be changed. Despite my skepticism about the quality behind the Macbook Pro M1 that only lasted 4 months of usage, I accepted the repair. One week later, I went back to the Apple store and casually checked the repaired laptop’s case. There were scratches around the top case logo. There was a dent on the bottom case edge. After I brought up these issue, the Genius Bar assistant became nervous and tried to run a diagnosis test. He couldn’t because one of the USB C port was broken. After checking the only other USB C port, the battery was entirely drained and failed the diagnosis test. The cost of the AppleCare repair was quoted $500, but the damages it caused was probably close to $1000 if not more. I bought a brand new $1400 Macbook Pro that in a few months, had turned into a beaten, refurbished product through AppleCare.

  As a reference, I've used PC's since the 70's (Northstar), IBM PC products since the early 80's, and Mac products since the early 90's.  I have used the computer as a consumer, a software developer, and an electrical engineer.,Reviewed Product: 2021MPB M1 Chip 8MB RAM.,I've had four MBPs since 2014 between home and work.,Apple Mac started as a great computing platform, but it has become progressively worse.,Apple is losing their grip.,Problems with this PC:,1.  Fewer ports.  This one has only two, which considering one is for charging, this actually has only one usable port.  There is no port on the right side of the computer, save an obsolute analog audio port that nearly nobody uses any more.,2. Reliability.  This Mac continuously locks up and requires reboots.,The only good feature of this Mac is that the keyboard works, which was not a usable feature in the prior Mac generation.  Funny how fixing something that was clearly wrong in a prior generation is seen as an improvement.,I have not run any different software on this than any of the others, so it is frustrating to see Apple move in the wrong direction.,I'm quickly losing faith in the Mac platform.,On the positive side, battery life is awesome.  I would trade that for the other features that Apple lost the recipe for, like reliability and a usable set of ports.

  Apple reached its peak in laptop design in 2017 with the 13"" MacBook Pro with Function Keys.  It was sleek, slim and powerful.  It was beautifully designed inside and out.  And with its Intel processor, it could also run Windows.,The next version introduced the ugly, tacky, useless Touch Bar.  This turned the beautifully designed 2017 MacBook Pro into something that looked like one of Dell's best effort.  It was definitely a step backwards and very un-Apple like.,Things got interesting when Apple threw in the M1 chip.  Though it lost the ability to run Windows, its vast performance increase made up for that.  Unfortunately, the Touch Bar remained so I held off on upgrading until the 14"" came out.,And when the 14"" model appeared, it was a disappointment.  Though with great pleasure the Touch Bar was ditched, in its place was an ugly notch we see in the current iPhones.  Moreover, the case was slightly thicker and more reminiscent of the Aluminum PowerBooks of the late 2000s.  This was another step backwards.  Plus its starting price was a whopping $2000.,So I decided I on this model, the 2020 13"" MacBook Pro, and felt I could live with the Touch Bar more than the notch.  And after 3 months of use, everything I thought about the Touch Bar still holds true.  It's ugly and useless.  I found its constantly blinking display distracting so I made it static, basically turning it into virtual function keys.,But the main reason for the upgrade was for the M1 chip.  And this didn't disappoint.  The new chip is very speedy, particularly when editing in Final Cut Pro.  It handles multi-camera HD projects with ease, where my 2017 machine struggled at times.  And battery life is longer and the machine in general runs cooler.,A drawback to the M1 chip is many old school apps will not work anymore.  So you'll have to spend some time and money looking for equivalent apps.,Despite the ugly Touch Bar, I recommend this machine over the new 14"" model.  It has the M1 chip, a display without an ugly notch, and a slimmer body.  It's fast enough for most users and it's hundreds of dollars less.

  I needed a laptop for school and chose a MacBook since it has a handoff feature and the iCloud stuff gets synced which helps a lot! You can copy a text on your iPad and it can be pasted right away to your MacBook which is amazing! I got mine with 16GB ram and it works great. It never lags and I play sims 4 on it to with over 30GB of custom content (cc) and mods. My game will never lag it loads super fast and works seamlessly. The fans rarely come on whenever I’m doing schoolwork. They do however come in during sims gameplay but that’s normal since it’s a heavy game. It doesn’t get hot either. The battery life is great. I’ll use it 2-4 hrs/day and the battery can last most of the week. The touch bar is amazing! I don’t know why people hate it. I use it a lot of the times and find it very useful! You can unlock your MacBook with your watch as well! This laptop is perfect! It does take some getting used to if you’ve never been on mac and only windows. But it is definitely very similar to my gaming pc! The M1 chip is insane! I definitely recommend and it is worth the money!

P.M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Owned a 2016 MacBook Air that had display issues from the get-go, but Apple said it might be okay if I was super careful handling it.  I couldn’t go without a laptop for 2 weeks so decided to risk it.  After a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump, and after the warranty period of course.  Used it hooked up to the TV only for about a year, but as that was difficult in itself (overheating, prevented sleep function, etc), had to change course.  Didn’t wanna pay $550 for a new display, so…,… bought the M1 2020 MacBook Air instead. Seemed to be operating well until 8 months in, when I wasn’t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out.  Wouldn’t turn on after repeated powering down so called Apple.  They had me power on with that shift-control for 10 secs and it went on again. However, considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to Apple.,They ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn’t working.  That’s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places, in case you, like I, didn’t really know what it did.  Had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way.,Sent in my laptop for repair and it’s now been more than a week without and they’re still “diagnosing” it.  Luckily my old laptop is still semi-functional if I hook it up to my TV.  And I still had a few months left in the warranty.  But what if it didn’t and I didn’t have the old one still functional?,Two times in a row MacBook Air with serious display issues in the last 5 yrs, with no accidental damage from me. Aside from this, has superior speed and processing power, doesn’t overheat, but still takes 20-30 sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the 2012 I used to have.,If you buy an Apple laptop now Apple care plus is almost mandatory.  Will have to seriously consider going back to Windows for my next laptop.,UPDATE (11/27/21):  It’s not only the hardware that has gone downhill, but their customer service as well.  Apparently, when I brought it in to the Apple store to be sent for repair, the serial numbers were mismatched somehow.,That resulted not only in at least a week and half delay (will be receiving my laptop 17 days after I dropped it off) but I had to spend 5 hours with customer service, including a TWO HOUR PHONE CALL (yes, you read that right) where I talked to a tech manager who said the mismatch in store was the 1st time he’s ever seen that in 17 yrs.  And the ambient light sensor failing in a MacBook (usually happens in phone) is something he almost never sees, too.  So either I was extremely unlucky or, more likely, the quality of both their hardware design/q&a AND their customer service has gone precipitously downhill.,And to top it off, was chatting online with one of their customer support reps, who first informed me of the mismatched serial numbers.  I then briefly voiced a couple of reasonable questions on how this could have happened (without being rude) and then this rep then completely ghosted the next 10 comments I wrote over 20 min.  Think that’s the first time I’ve ever been ghosted in a customer service chat.,The one thing I never really had questions or concerns about Apple in the past was its competency.  That’s obviously not the case now and I’m most likely going back to Android for my next phones and tablets, as well.

LC2024,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was really enjoying this computer and just after the one year mark my screen became defective. I was watching a lecture and shut my computer like normal. I came back to watch the lecture and noticed lines along the left side and bottom of my screen (see picture). I spent some time with Apple support and they kept pushing that I should have bought AppleCare. I have bought AppleCare in the past but I usually take care of my electronics so I have never had to use it. If I would have it would have been $269 and anywhere between $99 for display change or as I was quoted $299 for ""other"" damage at the Apple store. By the way, the technician tried to attribute the screen malfunction to the few pieces of dust between the display and keyboard. I was willing to even split the $600 bill they quoted me and just wanted it fixed. Apple was not accountable at all for their mistakes on this one. There is currently a class action lawsuit for this ""Display Gate"". Buyers beware of the ticking time bomb of a display.  I have been a loyal customer but I think I will be looking elsewhere for my computer needs moving forward. Are all the MacBooks bad, most likely not, but they are also not all perfect. Apple make this right for your customers.

M,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is probably the worst experience I've ever had with a company. I received the laptop , everything worked fine for several weeks and then all of a sudden every program causes a the laptop to crash. Brought it to the Apple store twice, they say everything is fine (after a clean format the issue still happens). It was sent out for repair, same issue happening on a clean disk. Their first suggestion is to send it out for a 4th repair... seriously? You would think that clearly their diagnostic tools aren't correct if they are not able to detect an obvious issue like this.. especially for a 1-2 grand computer. I hope I'll never have to run into customer support with this company again.

  Compressive and functional. However there is no free app coming with the apple watch monitoring the sleepingquality, e.g. time of deep sleep. The builtin sleep app is merely a time scheduler.

  Absolutely love this tablet. Only problem is that there is a little lag when you have a screen protector when pressing on the screen. Other than that it works perfect. Very Vivid and super light.

Macuser,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The hype: ""15-20 hours of battery life"" In Reality a fully charged battery is depleted after only 4-8 hours of web browsing which is not much different than the previous Intel Macbook 13 inch.,The hype: ""Crazy fast - faster than a $15,000 MacPro desktop"". Reality: Only slightly faster than the previous Intel Macbook 13 inch.  Maybe 25% faster.  Not a huge difference. Like today a little 3 minute 4K video took 45 minutes to render.,The hype: ""Stays so cool, fans don't come on"".  Reality: Fans come on rendering even a short little 2 minute 4K video.,New Irritations: Since this M1 Mac comes with the newest Big Sur operating system and Mac programs; e.g. Safari/Mail /Pages/iMovie, etc programs, I find the new versions less legible and less easy to figure out how operate.  Also alot of infurting system hangs and BEACH BALLS !!. This slows down my work.  Overall, I think if you have a 2016 on up Intel Macbook Pro, you should NOT get the M1 Pro unless you all you expect is a minor, almost unnoticable speed boost.

  Ordered this MacBook Pro for my business as I already had bought my first one from Costco. One from Costco is still working great, never a problem. Needed a second one for my business and thought oh Amazon has a better price than what I paid for my first one . Went ahead and ordered from Amazon… used 2x and put it away for the next 2 weeks.. Needed to start using it more and surprise, surprise,Beach ball of Death came on! No amount of restarting it fixed it.. Amazon customer service offered to help me fix it…,Whaaat, brand new expensive electronics shouldn’t have to be fixed after using it2x… Returned and will never buy a laptop from Amazon. Had to chase my refund for almost a month till finally it was refunded today .. Be Ware!

naplesinsider,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Don't believe the hype.  With 8GB (supposedly more than adequate due to new design) this is slower than 5-year old MacBook air it replaced. It is also buggy, for example the print queue does not work at all (a known bug also experienced by others).  Massively overrated.
"
Some Guy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded from a late-2013 MacBook to this M1, after believing all the hype about the speed of the processor, etc. The marketing for the M1 and the (probably fake) glowing early reviews made the M1 out to bee akin to the second coming of Jesus Christ himself. Wow, how wrong Apple was! The M1 is buggy and SLOOOOOW. It's slower than the 2013 laptop that I replaced it with!,To fix some of the buggy issues, I've spent COUNTLESS hours in chat sessions and on phone calls with Apple for the past year -- which has all been an agonizingly frustrating waste of time. I'm currently in talks with Tim Cook's office to replace this machine, and by the feel of it, their highest-level executives are about as good as the cheap, run-of-the-mill chat agents I've been screaming at every month for the past year. What a mistake it has been to purchase the M1. I hate apple, and I am seriously considering a move back to Microsoft. Apple is a brainwashed cult -- and an expensive one.

Charles,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Try to do any of the normal, everyday tasks that a professional creator must do - transfer files from one hard drive to another, connect external monitors - anything.  You will find this product makes those things difficult, if not impossible.  Only two ports, one of which must provide power, means a constant juggling act with dongles, most of which will dramatically reduce transfer speeds over a direct usb-c connection.  Try finding a dongle with four USB-c connectors.  You can't.  I don't know why apple, in it's perpetual arrogance, decided us peasants didn't need external connections, but it makes this lightning-fast M-1 chip a real dud.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Really disappointing memory, I have the 8gb and it feels really really slow, I opened 8 sites in the Safari browser, and a few other little things and it's really slow. I constantly worry about closing some of what I opened, which really bothers me at work.,My previous computer moved much faster,MacBook Air 2013 a1466 with 8gb 256 gb ssd  memory worked fine.,The m1 has a really weak memory . I'm disappointed . After 8 years I was expecting a more powerful MacBook Air 2013  with the same level of memory.
"
John R. Pepp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The only reason I didn’t buy this at Amazon as I like dealing with Apple directly in case I have any issues.,First the pros:,1. The computer is fast and very portable. So far I am digging the M1 chip.,2. Surprisingly the computer is reasonably priced and is cheaper to the PC competitors. You can probably find affiliated links to find it cheaper here on Amazon. Like I said I like buying directly from Apple.,The Cons:,1. I wished the screen was a touch screen as I find myself wanting to press the screen. LOL,2. I wish it had more ports, but Apple over the years have been frugal in that department.,I highly recommend this computer.
"
Matt Wegner,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had my Macbook Pro M1 (8gb, 256gb storage) for 2 or 3 months now... I can honestly say I regret purchasing this so much. It works well a lot of the time but there's too many little issues that've piled up at this point. People familiar with Mac, no need to read on. If you are used to working on a Windows machine, read this before proceeding:,Conclusion: the chip is fast and it's an awesome piece of hardware, but the laptop is fairly clunky and buggy when extending to montiors/working together with DisplayLink. If your primary use case will NOT be external monitors, then i think you will be pleased. If you do extend the display, you're in for a treat.,Pros:,Greater battery life - it's true, this thing lasts a long time,Great screen - I am a big fan of the high resolution which lets you see more of the screen, and it's a bright screen as well.,Good sound - the built-in speakers sound very solid,General Performance - when it comes to web pages and the like, it performs well. I am not a power user and thus haven't really 'pushed' this thing with any depending programs so i can't speak to that,Cons:,COMPATIBILITY - I have used this by itself as well as with a Dell D6000 docking station which requires DisplayLink. I am extending to dual Dell 27"" 1440p 144hz monitors. For whatever reason, DisplayLink hates Mac... VERY often, Chrome/Safari will crash on launch. I can't emphasize this annoyance enough. Yes, I've circumvented the problem by finnicking with the DisplayLink program and unplugging/replugging in the Thunderbolt cable... it shouldn't have to come to that.,When i try and listen with my Airpods, a lot of the time the bluetooth connection will drop and the sound will want to play out of my laptop external speakers.,Another thing on performance - as mentioned above, it generally performs well, but honestly this thing takes too long to start up after being fully powered off. I had a laptop with an SSD before that turned on probably 3x quicker than this. And certain programs like Spotify take a surprising amount of time to load. One thought: I saw a video of someone clicking through and opening all the programs on their dock and they popped up immediately. This laptop does not do that.
"
John Erik Krische,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  To start I want to give full disclosure. I didn't buy this laptop on amazon and I have the 16gb model, so my experience won't 100% match yours, as amazon only sells the 8gb model.,To start, I am a pc guy. always have been and still am for the most part. Intel Mac laptops never really were appealing to me as they always seemed overpriced for the performance you would get, and as such apple laptops never really stood out to me. Well that was, until apple silicon released. When I first heard the announcement for apple silicon, I was skeptical It could compete with intel chips. but when I saw the benchmarks, I knew apple had created something special.,First, the battery life. I usually get around 10 hours on a charge with a normal workload of word processing, watching videos and listening to music at around half brightness. a long shot from the advertised 20 hours of battery life, but that figure was taken with ideal circumstances and lower brightness. Now 10 hours battery on a laptop isn't unheard of, but considering the other two strengths of the laptop, performance and thermals, it more impressive than it would usually be.,Performance is great, easily matching or beating much of Intels 11th gen lineup, and thermals are outstanding. In the few weeks I've owned the laptop, I have only heard the fan turn on during benchmarks, and even at full load, the cpu barely gets above 60 degrees c, far lower than the toasty 95 degrees that the intel chips get to under load.,The screen is great, but as an apple product that is to be expected.,Now all of this is great, but it all comes with one massive caveat; Rosetta. Now rosetta is great. it allows basically all intel software to run on the computer, and this is great if you are a pro user waiting on software developers to update to native code, but its bad if you have, for example, chat software that hasn't been updated. even simple programs running under rosetta chew the battery life, and that isn't ideal at all.,In the end, this laptop is great. It is very powerful, quit, cool, and fast. the only thing currently holding it back is lack of native software support, and as apple silicon matures I expect that issue to be solved eventually. Overall I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone that is willing to pony up the steep asking price.
"
Stormie Foster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I went into Apple the other day & got one of the lovely estimates to fix the display of my last pro. I ended up just buying a new computer because of the price & I was a bit annoyed about it. The guy at Apple talked this computer up like crazy & I begrudgingly bought it.,This is the best laptop I’ve ever owned. The keyboard is different than the last pros & feels more like the air. They are so much better. The display feels like when you leave the eye doctor with a new prescription, you forgot there were leaves on trees. It’s beautiful. I haven’t gotten a lag in WoW yet. I’m so impressed.

  I was not expecting to use this as much as I do. I’ve started using in more than my iPhone because of the screen size. I’m regularly finding new ways to implement it into my work flow as well. Also, the magic keyboard is lovely. That said, I bought the keyboard from a friend so I did not pay the full retail price. Retail price for the keyboard is sickening, its almost half the cost of the iPad.,Overall, this is an amazing machine that I highly recommend purchasing as it will add value to your live.

  I loved taking notes on the iPad but it was very hard to use in place of a laptop. Since I’m in college I need to use office to write papers and make PowerPoints. Apples version of Microsoft just wasn’t cutting it. It was very difficult to use and kind of glitchy so I had to return so I could buy an actual laptop. If you are looking for something to just take notes on or something small and portable this iPad is definitely worth it.

"
Hidekel Uriarte,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the seamless integration and interactions it has with my Apple Watch, AirPods, and iPhone. I know people who don't have more than one Apple device hear all the time that having more than one always works great because of the ecosystem but usually only take it at face value. I was one of those people even up until I had my Apple Watch for a while but the MacBook really hooked me in. Once you realize how everything just works you don't know how you were able to do it before. Of course there is the whole walled garden argument everyone that dislikes Apple love to talk about but in reality I don't care if this walled garden is at war the rest of the world it's the best, most simple, and seamless ecosystem for the average consumer. There is a learning curve for those that come from other operating systems like the different feel of the keyboard, shortcuts, trackpad, and overall OS. But I've only been using this device for short while and already caught on super quick. I feel like despite all these positives there is still the high price. I purchased the 512 GB model and it came to around $1400 with a sale so it might take a while for the slight buyer's remorse to go away but I feel like the more I use it the quicker I become satisfied with my purchase. My final thoughts would have to be, if you have the money to purchase this at any configuration then go for it. Simply keep in mind there is a lot that goes into the satisfaction for this product; the ecosystem which would require more apple devices, the willingness to learn a new OS, understanding the added level of security and privacy that comes with Apple devices and the use case for each individual.

Ilya,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Overall a great piece of hardware, if used on its own or with 1 external monitor. However, this laptop does not support more than 1 external monitor. I tried everything, including buying dongles and trying 3rd party workarounds.,There may be a way, if you spend a lot of time and buy extra add-ons. However, for a premium laptop, it is unthinkable that 2 monitors are not supported. My budget ASUS laptop does this without issue.,I have heard that Intel macs don't have this issue. I suggest holding off on M1 if you plan to use multiple screens.

  I have used several MacBooks over the years: MacBook 2007, 2009, MacBook pro Late 2013, MacBook Air 2017, iMac 2019, Intel MacBook Pro 2020 and the M1 MacBook Pro 2020.,Before buying the M1 MacBook Pro 2020, I had the Intel Core i5 MacBook Pro 2020 for a few months and was the worst machine of the group. That machine heated so much that my hands could feel the heat on the upper surface, and the fans were spinning at the maximum speed. The fans were noisy too.  When I googled for solutions, many solutions seemed to suggest that I stop doing many of the activities I usually do, including watching YouTube videos, work etc... I sold it.,This new M1 MacBook Pro 2020 is not only fast and quiet, I have not felt a single reason to stop doing the things I want to do. I know the M1 is a little more expensive but is also more efficient.

Amanda Costa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I already had an HP laptop that had no problems other than the battery life was lacking. So, why did I get another one? I'm about to start nursing school at the end of August which requires you to have a laptop all day (about 8 hours). My dad surprised me this MacBook. I am an apple girl through and through (watch, phone, AirPods). To say that I was over the moon receiving my first MacBook was an understatement. I've been testing it out for about a week now. It came in perfect condition. No scratches or problems with the screen. This computer is FAST when it comes to everything. As soon as you open it, it is on. I seriously can't catch it off no matter how little I open it. Every web page pops up quick and loads quicker. I'm amazed that I can text through this MacBook and it synced all of my stuff from the cloud effortlessly. It has a Touch Bar that is insanely cool and in my opinion, useful. The battery life. OMG the battery life. I purposely did everything in my power to drain it. I am on day 7 of using it without charging it and it is at 41%. Now, I haven't been on it all day everyday. I have mainly used it to write, read, and text. However, I've used for a good 4 hours each day. If you're a college student who needs a reliable computer this one is for you!!!! It is 100% worth every penny. If you want coverage for the MacBook always go through apple. They will give you the best bang for your buck.

I bought the M1 as it is supposed to be the fastest, and perhaps it is, but if I am just on the internet or using microsoft word to write a paper for school. It does not outdo the Intel in my previous laptop.  I put them next to one another to test the speed on chrome.  My entire life is on chrome, so switching to safari would be a pain.  I use it at work and personal.  It is ridiculously slow compared to my old macbook.  I took it back to the store and showed them, and they replaced my laptop thinking it was a hardware issue.  No, it is still the same.  After researching, apparently this is the case with the new M1 - it does not run chrome or microsoft office efficiently.  If you don't need these apps, then go for it, but if you do, you will find yourself frustrated that it takes so long to load a page just going through the internet.

  Apple makes absolute trash laptops and offers no support whatsoever. I bought one in 2019 and it's already broken twice and the cost of a repair is as much as a new computer. I will NEVER buy another apple laptop as they only put out trash. My previous MacBook Pro was from 2011. That's how much the quality of these paper weights has gone down. Stay away. If I can prevent 1 person from spending this much money on literally anything else, I will be happy.

  I got this baby on Christmas and I came from using windows laptops. It was a change and I'll tell you, I won't ever go bac to windows. I love this thing. The battery alone last days! Mine was ordered straight through apple, and it came same day. So far I've been using this thing to browse the internet and do some light work.  I use an external hard drive for photos and music cause  is a 256 and 8g. I have Microsoft office 2019 installed and its working like a charm.

Michael kennedy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  From a build quality standpoint Apple knocked it out of the park.  These feel nicer than the audiophile grade headphones I own which cost $1800.  From an audio quality perspective these are hands down the best wireless headphones I've ever heard.  I almost cannot believe getting this quality from ANC bluetooth headphones, it almost compares to other hi-fi grade headphones which require a standalone amp/dac to function.,From a price standpoint?  Well that's only something you can decide.  Everyone has their own price barriers.
"
Dejan Horgas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Good sound quality with clear bass, miss and highs. Unlike some reviews I did not notice any sibilance that affects the SQ and I find the sound profile to be well balanced. In my opinion they sound much better, richer and fuller than the Sony WH-1000XM4. The headphones are easy to listen to for an hour or more and I do not notice any fatigue. They are heavy, but the headband is unlike anything else I have used before and does a very good job to distribute the weight on the top of the head such that I do not feel that comfort is an issue even after more than an hour of wear. I did not experience any condensation buildup as others have reported. Noise cancellation is best in class and the transparency mode is superior to both Bose and Sony. Unlike the Sony WH-1000XM4 and its XM3 predecessor (both of which I’ve owned), the AirPods Max do exhibit some sound leaking. This may or may not be a problem when listening at night depending on volume level and other person’s sensitivity.
"
Clive Forrester,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I tried my best to love this product, but it simply did not stick and here’s why…,When I first purchased this it was the best pair of headphones I’ve ever owned. Best sound quality, seamless connectivity between all Apple devices, perfect noise cancellation. I was wearing the future.,Then it hit the 5 week mark.,At first it started slowly, but then it started to escalate. Connections weren’t was instantaneous. Noise cancellation didn’t always work. Head detection would drop sometimes. The headphone would connect but the buttons didn’t work. It got to the point were I was doing a hard reset every other day.,So I went to the apple store one day when it simply stopped connecting to my phone. Neither I nor the Apple “genius” could get it to connect. So I returned it. And purchased another pair. And life was great again.,Then it hit the 5 week mark.,And all the problems returned on this new pair like clockwork. Eventually I traded it in and got the M1 Mac mini. Much better use of the money.,What was wrong with both headphones? If I were to guess WATER DAMAGE. Yes. And I never once worked out in it  nor worn it near water. If you wear the headphones for an extended time, 2+ hours, the ear-cups gather water from condensation like crazy. Almost as if you sprayed water inside. The device has a serious design flaw and Apple urgently needs to look into it.
"
J,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Update: It supports lossless audio now. Apple is currently selling a 3.5mm port to lightning cable to allow it for $45! But quite the price Apple!,Quite expensive, but the quality is there. Built quality from the sides made from metal, the removable ear-cups… all are amazing!  However it doesn’t support lossless audio which was recently launched with a Apple Music subscription. I would have hoped a $779 pair of headphones would support audio through the lightning port as well, but it seems like it’s only for charging at the moment. Perhaps in the future through a software update?
"
Marc Perez,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love music! Couldn't wait to get my hands on these. They are to heavy for working out, and the material soak up the sweat. You can't move to suddenly as they shift very easily. Listening to Netflix and Apple TV is very cool. The noise cancelation is superb! I like the dial and the button to switch modes. I love how easily I can switch from one device to another. I would however wait until the features are more accessible to other platforms.
"
Pierre-André Sabourin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Comme à l’habitude Apple sort un produit très bon. Son très séduisant matériaux d’une qualité juste folle !! Cher mes franchement je regrette pas mon achat. Je recommande fortement j’écoute de la musique des films et juste incroyable un vrais travail dans faite par le casque. Mode transparence est vraiment bon et très très claire. La réduction de bruit active est aussi excellente ! Je le trouve très confortable. Donc si vous avez le budget et des produits Apple vous y trouvé votre bonheur !
"
Jay-Ar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very unique sound signature - emphasis on the lower bass frequencies, not on the usually emphasized mid bass. If you love female vocals, look elsewhere... there’s a significant dip in the upper midrange region. However, it comes back up on the treble region, giving the listener a sense of spaciousness a bit. Overall, I like the sound sig, just not applicable to all types of genres.,Connection-wise, here’s where I got a problems. After not wearing them for a while, say 8 hours, when you wear it, it connects for a second then disconnects. You need to take it off your head/ears and re-place them to reconnect. Didn’t just happen once, it happened most of the time making the experience a little bit frustrating.

"
jean-luc Bachelot,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I own all apple things. Totally worth the extra money.,They sound fantastic, however special audio seems a little quiet to me.,Bad is decent, overall sound is great. Well balanced imo.,Can you get better sounding headphones for cheaper most likely. But it pares with all my apple things and that's more important to me than the slightly better sound.,At the end of the day if I'm fighting to connect my headphones I won't use them much. This just works. And they do sound great!,Very comfortable, maybe slightly on the heavy side, but a few hours of coding and they don't get uncomfortable. The solid feel makes up for the weight.,If you want something that sounds great, and feels premium, as in you did not just spend a bunch of money on some plastic headphones. That's will satisfy that.,If you are an audio snob, and have high end headphones get these for what they are. Easy to use, great consumer sound, with a premium feel. Don't compare to the headache of audiophile equipment.

Yes, it may be pricey, but the quality is there.

It didn’t come cracked or broken! The starter “Hello” worked just fine! Best thing I have bought from Amazon.
"
Juan José,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Considero que la calidad del sonido en comparación de los AirPods Pro es bastante similar, y hay que destacar que la diferencia de los precios es considerablemente significativa. Por otro lado, de forma personal, resultaron un poco incómodos, ya que ejercen mucha presión, al grado que después de un par de horas de comienzo a sentir molestias en la mandíbula, esto no me pasa con audífonos de otras marcas.,Por último, en relación con la duración de la bateria, en comparación con los Airpods Pro, efectivamente, una carga de los Airpod Max dura tres veces en compración con los Airpods Pro (sin cargarlos nuevamente en el estuche) pero, en comparación con otras marcas, los Airpods Max se quedan atrás.
"
Simon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought them and loved the sound but it doesn't work properly with buzzing noise on the left side. Tried contacting Amazon to get it replace and to my surprise they said there's nothing they can do as the item can not be return or replace. Took a very long phone call and explaining to actually get them replace it so make sure you really want these before buying.
"
Ver2nine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound coming out of these headphones is very good with no distortion. Unfortunately they are heavy and I struggle to watch a 2 hour movie. After half an hour they start to get uncomfortable on my ears and neck. Sadly, I had to return them. The challenge now is to find another brand with a sound quality similar to AirPods Max’s.
"
Andrew P.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I tested the Sony XM4, Bose QC45, and the Apple Airpods Max. The APM were much better for music quality and comfort, but lack in battery life. They are also terrible with MS teams. I had to switch to my old ear buds in meetings because nobody could hear me with the APM. The noise cancellation was close to zero.,Amazon insists that these are not returnable and has hung up on me when I point out to them that they do not provide this information anywhere on their site.
"
Carlos Valerio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Había adquirido recién unos Bose 700, muy buenos, excelente cancelación de ruido y buena configuración de audio; con los Airpods Max se mejora en la cancelación de ruido y funcionan perfecto con el ecosistema Apple. ¿Son mejores que los Bose?, la verdad no mucho y el precio y es muy diferente, si eres usuario de Apple los recomiendo ampliamente si no busca los Bose 700 o los Sony WH1000XM4.

  Anteriormente use unos Bosé 700 y los sony WHm4 estoy verdaderamente satisfecho con la cancelación de sonido de los AirPods Max e incluso escucho la música a un 50-70% cuando con los Bosé subía a 90% (la calidad de sonido es muy buena) cuando salieron me desanime porque pensé que estaban carísimos tipo apple pero llevo ya 5 meses con ellos y son una maravilla
"
A. Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nice design and noise canceling is very good - better than expected.,Sound is enjoyable, especially the Surround Sound for Movies. Even with Apple TV is quite fun. I have yet to try the Dolby Music but I do like the staging of the spacial music and directional tricks. It makes you want to revisit music you may have set aside in the past.

  I received these headphones from Amazon and on closer inspection there was damage to the left optical sensor (as shown in the pictures, I also attached an image of the right optical sensor for comparison). I reached out to Amazon to return these headphones and they outright refused to return them. They told me to contact Apple, who I did contact and stated that the headphones were likley damaged at Amazon's warehouse and that it is Amazon's responsibility to address the issue. Otherwise I would have to pay $300-350 to fix the headphones. I notified this to Amazon who still refused to return the item and essentially offered no solution. Thus, leaving me with a damaged $800 pair of headphones. Do not buy these headphones from Amazon as you can't trust the quality you will receive. I am truly dissapointed in this purchase.

Bernabe Guido Ayala,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  El diseño y los materiales son excepcionales, como cualquier producto de Apple. El audio es impresionante al igual que la cancelación del ruido. La combinación de dolby atmos y el audio espacial son excelentes. De repente siento algo de presión o algo apretados, pero creo que es la costumbre, son los primeros de este tipo que uso. Altamente recomendados.

Rafael Peñaloza Gómez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are incredible. The sound is awesome, noise cancellation is so great and the transparency mode is “godlike”. I mean, if you can afford them and you are in the Apple world already, just go for it. And for those concerned about the battery life, it’s not that bad. I’ve been away for over a week and, in the “case” they were still at 75%. So it’s pretty good.

JCAZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When I received my new Macbook Pro 13"" with M1 chip, the inside of the white Apple laptop box, the charging cable, and the actual Macbook laptop smelled strongly of mold., I was able to decrease the smell somewhat by repeatedly soaking the waterproof parts of the charging cable, but obviously there's no way to wash or soak the inside of the laptop.  Mold smell is still very noticeable around plastic vented areas at the back of the laptop, even after leaving the new Macbook out of the box for several days to air out. After researching problem in other forums, found that some other customers have had similar problems with new Apple charging cables, USB-C to USB-C cables,  and laptops/laptop packaging.  I never had this happen before, and definitely never expected this from Apple. Real bummer, especially for price paid. (Ordered direct from Apple online store, hoping that customer service might be easier.)
"
Hayden S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought a 13"" MacBook Pro 16GB, 1TB directly from Apple but I wanted to leave my thoughts here in case anyone is on the fence. It is worth it. The new M1 chip is able to keep up with my workflow without breaking a sweat when all the other PCs and Macs in my office have to ramp up their fans to try to keep up. Battery life for me lasts around 10 hours of hard work when my previous Mac would have died within 3 hours. This is truly a next-generation product.
"
Marsha W. Maxwell,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  At a time when so many people are working at home, to release a new laptop that only supports one external monitor is absolutely absurd.  Everything else works fine, as you would expect with an apple product.  So I am back to using my 2019 Macbook until Apple gets their act together. VERY disappointed.
"

  I ordered this macbook pro with an 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 and my old Lenovo passed the speed of this computer 10 fold. I don't even know why I thought it was a good idea to purchase this garbage. It's like personal heating pad, and sounds like an airplane taking off. Tiny holes on the side of the keyboard does not cut it for cooling the pc. Not worth the buy at all.

  I bought this in May 2020 right after pandemic for my son's online school. It worked OK when it worked. After 1.5 years of use, all of sudden one perpendicular bar showed up on the right hand of screen, and one horizontal bar showed up on the bottom of the screen. It was annoying but still functional. After few days later, it does not turn on. I have bought few dozens of Apple product, but this mac book pro is by far the worst product I have ever bought. And, it is not only me. If you goole it, you will find this issue is very common.

L. Doucette,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are dynamite headphones. There have been reviews on YouTube saying,They we’re not as bassy as the Sony but they are extremely bassy and wonderful,And very detailed! All you have to do is turn on extra bass on your iPhone or iPad etc.,In settings. They are phenomenal for movies. They are very well-made and cool looking.,I would highly recommend it if you are able to afford them. They are a little overpriced,Like what I really like about them is that they connect instantly to your device. And then connect to our Apple,Devices just like that.
"
Peenoid,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great headphones. If you are in the Apple ecosystem, you can rest assured and believe the hype. Great quality, great sound, awesome perks (handoff, super easy setup, etc.)… the NC is crazy — on some sensory deprivation type level. You might be thinking it’s not worth $900, but it’s Apple; it is hyper-designed so you feel like you’ve gotten something you’ve definitely paid for. 10/10

"
Cassie T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've been a Windows user for years and recently upgraded to MacOS through the company I work with. After using both Operating System simultaneously for 2 years, it was time to upgrade my personal laptop. Purchasing a MacBook Pro was the best decision I made. It's a very powerful machine with great battery life. It handles all my tasks really well and no lag. 10/10 recommend to anyone looking to upgrade.

  For the things I needed to do for telework, the MacBook Air M1 has been amazing.  I had concerns about not have a newer gen Intel processor but after using this and seeing the battery life, I won't look back and buying more Apple products with this processor.  Highly recommend for this price point.  I can't believe how light and fast this thing is.

  The hardware in this unit is pathetic and is more expensive due to the ""apple"" brand name. You are better off building your own pc and with these specs it would be LESS THAN HALF the price. Stop paying for a name
"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I dont like that the new MacBook is not compatible with many older divides such as CD or DVD players from different brands. You have to pay extra for the extension to connect through HDMI or USB etc .I wish I knew all that before I bought it. The rest is good,  just like older MacBooks.
"
Justin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you're like me and use multiple external monitors with your laptop, you should know that until Apple releases an update to their OS, you can only hook up ONE external monitor to this computer.,I ended up buying a 43"" monitor, so that I could have 1 external monitor do the job of (2) 27"" monitors.

"
Ian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings.,Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life, but it's not far off. This isn't a huge deal for me, as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available, but for someone who needs the portability, the difference is substantial.,UPDATE 6/16/21: I have been using this laptop for over 6 months now on a daily basis. I have done everything from Word documents, email, web surfing, Logic Pro, Neural DSP guitar plugins, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Illustrator, and many other tasks and I do not think that I have even heard the fan come on 1 time. It's pretty astounding. The M1 is still exceedingly snappy and the battery life blows me away. And while more and more apps become native to M1, I'd expect performance to do nothing but improve.

  This new MBP replaces my old 2011 machine. It is lighter, much faster, very quiet and the display is gorgeous! I didn’t think I would care for the Touch Bar but find myself really enjoying a feature not found on the new MacBook Air.,Transferring my images, music and data was simple and quick. If I had it to do over I would by a new M1 MBP.,I have heard a lot of negative comments because Apple didn’t change the physical appearance of the 2020 MBP. Personally, I am quite happy that it still looks like an Apple MBP.

  Well last eat 3 days then turned on and off by itself repeatedly like the was rermfab well piece of junk what else wast of time and money and 150 more than other sellers u think your would pay a little more to get something better also there was a stain that would not come out on eaothsr side of the face of the keyboard areas. Again most like a remanufauterrd unit that should of been sol for half ... thanks for ripping me off

  Apple took a big step back on this one! Beware… This M1 computer only serves one remote display.
"
Maurice Rivera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Apple hit it out of the park with the new M1 chip. It outperforms I7 laptop from a year ago by a long shot. Plus outperforms most while having a over 12 hour battery life. I not no Apple fan, but this laptop is great. Plus they finally got rid of the dreaded butterfly keyboard that would fail even when we’ll taken care of and when back to the older but mature scissor keyboard design. The screen is accurate, if your looking to upgrade. This is the one to get, or even go with the base model with out touch bar and still will outperform the intel macs and other laptops, while having the best power management on any laptop seen to date, while at a finally reasonable price.

"Michael Lacey, Devo Writers",5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's a solid Apple product, and I was WAY overdue to get a laptop. I researched and considered several pre-owned models, but the cost on this MacBook Pro and the M1 chip made it a clear choice. With used/refurbished computers, there are still risks, not to mention lower battery life and physical damage. With a brand new machine, those chances are almost completely gone!,I'm so glad I went with the new MacBook Pro. And if I decide to 'upgrade', I know this machine will hold its value in the used market.

  + Performance.,- 2 USB-c ports - really!?,- My old Macbook had no issues with the wifi signal from my desk. The new one does.
"
juju,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  this is my 3rd Macbook pro.  and each time it gets better.  Much thinner than my previous one, and very light weight.  the only thing I don't like is that it only has the USB c, which doesn't allow charging of other devices.  I had to go and get the adaptor for an additional $20.  Also they don't include the extension cord anymore, which I don't mind, since I already have 2 that came with the other ones.

Julie T,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When I turn it on in the morning it takes up to 5 minutes to connect with the internet.  This happens everywhere I take it so it is not my internet.  The charger port is different then all other apple products so have to spend more money to have an extra charger.  Battery only lasts a few days.  For the money I am very disappointed.

Lance Nguyen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Upgraded from a 2015 Macbook Pro that has lasted me well more than 5 years in school. I expected the keyboard to be like the earlier gen macbooks; however, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were way more raised and offered a much better tactile feedback. In addition, the battery life will easily last a day of school. The only thing I don't like about this laptop is how the M1 Chip doesn't support VM and a few other apps; but that can be changed in the future.
"

henry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This new iPad Air,  It's a bit faster, a bit thinner, a bit lighter, and a bit shinier than all the tablets I've used before, except the IPAD PRO, which was too expensive. But, taken altogether--and taken along with the second-gen Apple Pencil--it feels like an entirely new experience. I haven't been this struck by a new device in a while.
"

  I have had countless laptops and desktops, some that are even more expensive than this one. I've never been more content with a computer before. I don't even know where to begin. The best part is probably how fast it is. I bought it early one and have had it for about a year and a half. I do everything on it from studying, to watching movies, to downloading games. It seems just as fast and smooth as it did before. I even was able to partition the hard drive to get windows and you would be surprised at its ability to run games at medium graphics settings as well. Battery life is also stellar. I don't know what the advertised length is, but just to give you a clue I leave for lecture every morning with 100% battery, use it anywhere between 6-10 hours throughout the day, and always return home with a lot of battery life to spare. No more lugging around chargers in your backpack. Display is awesome.,I don't really have any cons to it. Anything ""negative"" is really just small stuff, and the only thing I can think of is I just wish it had more ports. But that is really nitpicking. I honestly don't use the touch bar that much, but it looks cool and doesn't really take up space if you don't use it so that does not matter. If you're looking for a laptop that is a jack of all trades, this is it.

  Does everything it's supposed to, no problems yet.  But as time goes on the updates won't take and we will have to buy a new one.  Unfortunately, this is not like the old school computers that you can update and make last for years to come.

  Nothing has changed, but the increase of price. The computer like most Apple products runs on the hot side, and after being fully charged it doesn't last very long. The new Ipad is worse when it comes to charging. I am an Apple user for all things so I knew what I was getting myself into. The lack of ports to connect other items to it is very disappointing. You have to spend more money on hubs. With the price being what it is at least give us back the usb, hdmi, and more thunberbolts standard.

Gabriel Paulo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excepcional! Para quem vem do Windows, terá um pouco de dificuldade no começo, afinal estamos falando de outro sistema operacional. O acabamento do produto é excelente e vale o valor cobrado por vendedores entre 9 a 10K, entretanto, pagar mais que isso nesse notebook, como por exemplo os 17K cobrados pela Apple no site oficial, não vale o produto. A mesma análise eu faria para comprar uma versão de 8gb ou 16gb, pagar o valor extra, que faz o notebook chegar a casa dos 15K (vendedores sem ser site oficial) deve ser pensado com muito cuidado e embasado em uma excelente justificativa, pois pra uso profissional o modelo de 8Gb tem sido mais que o suficiente, agora, se sua ideia for trabalhar com edições de vídeo para empresas, com material proveniente de câmeras de altíssimo nível, edição e criação de conteúdos em layers em softwares como After Effects (ainda falando de trabalhos extremamente profissionais, pois trabalhos mais comuns como meros mortais usam, a versão de 8gb também é suficiente), aí sim, vá no de 16gb se também precisar de portabilidade/locomoção. Contudo, se faça a seguinte pergunta: Se for para trabalhos gráficos pesados, por que não adquirir um Workstation?,Abraços e espero ter ajudado quem pretende comprar esse excelente produto.

  It took half a day to set up.  I had to leave it with my iPhone within range of WiFi and connected to chargers while I downloaded a long series of updates and performed a long series of restarts.,The battery life is about 18 hours so I need to take it off to charge while I sleep.  This makes it difficult to use as a sleep monitor and use it as a watch all day.,The watch isn’t very useful without being always linked to my iPhone.  Now I have to have  Bluetooth on my iPhone always on which sucks battery life. Also, the watch/iPhone combo made the decision for me that my iPhone alerts are now silent and the watch will tap my wrist for alerts.  After missing a couple appointments I had to disconnect the watch by turning off Bluetooth.  I searched through the hundreds of settings and couldn’t find the one where I gave permission to make decisions about iPhone settings without my consents.,Apple doesn’t include power supplies anymore and they switched all there power cords to a new connector so I can’t use the 10 old power supplies I have sitting in a drawer.  Seems like a cash grab.  I guess they are out of ideas for new useful products that would increase sales.

tonydean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Everyone that is complaining about the ""surprise"" usb-c charging cable, you need to actually read before you buy. It clearly states in the item description what type of charging cable it comes with. Dont give the 1 star reviews over your own neglect of reading what you are getting. Those that had a hard time setting up the watch also  need to do the same. Do some research, and find out if your current firmware is what is needed to run the watch you are purchasing. So many people just leave negative comments when the item is great, but their lack of doing any reading, or research is their own fault. This is a GREAT WATCH PERIOD!

"
Jeff Gomske,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Okay, I've been an Android fan since, well, since the very beginning...I still am if I'm being honest. I have also spent a ridiculously large amount of $$ on smart watches over the years starting with the original Moto 360 (anyone remember that flat tire?). It LOOKED cool, especially that round face, but performance-wise, well, it was kinda terrible. The battery life was insultingly horrible (it would lose 7% in the ten minute drive to work while just sitting on my wrist doing nothing). But the potential was there. In finally switched to Samsung's Tizen at the introduction of the Gear S2. What a great watch that was. I went on to the Gear S3, the Gear Sport, the Galaxy Watch, the GW3 and then I heard the news: Samsung was going back to Wear OS. This disappointed me greatly. Over the years I have owned well over a dozen watches utilizing Wear OS (or Android Wear before that) and while I loved a lot about many of them, they ALL suffered from the stuttering and glitching that plagues essentially ALL Wear OS devices. Some have managed to work around that to produce the best version they possibly can (TicWatch Pro 3 and the Oppo Watch are just 2 examples) but each had at least something that just didn't work properly - and I don't blame either manufacturer for this. It's an ongoing problem with Wear OS itself. Slowly, I began to warm to the idea that maybe, just MAYBE Samsung will make it work the way it was always supposed to work. So, I bought the Galaxy Watch 4.,Did Samsung fix Wear OS? In a word: NO. It still suffers from glitches, hiccups and stuttering and apps not opening properly and/or timely. At times it works just great (which is more often than not, but still...), I have a fairly expensive watch that ruins what otherwise ought to be a smoother experience than what I'm getting. My Galaxy Watch 3 runs fantastic (it runs on TIzen software and not Wear OS) and honestly, I have had zero issues with it since I got it over a year ago, nor any with my previous Tizen watches including the Gear S2, S3, Gear Sport and original Galaxy Watch. I have had intermittent issues with the GW4 since the day I brought it home. To be fair, I have heard many people who claim that their Watch 4's have run flawlessly since they bought theirs...but I cannot speak to their experience, only the one I've had - but I brought it up to be fair.,I have done a LOT of research regarding all different kinds of smart watches, and you know what you almost never hear from the majority of apple watch owners? You don't hear about not getting a notification, or stuttering and glitches here and there. Sure, I'm sure they exist, but the overwhelming majority generally say the same thing: the watch JUST WORKS. Honestly, that is all I really care about. Does it do what it claims and does it do it consistently? From an Android Fanboy, I can say this without reservation: the apple watch works and does so CONSISTENTLY. I simply cannot say that about my GW4 or any other Wear OS device I have used over the last 6-8 years.,Okay, now why did I switch? Well, when I heard that the apple watch could be used without an iPhone, it really caught my attention. Seriously, an apple watch that can be set up so the user does not need an iPhone?? Well that's just what I wanted to hear. The truth is, once the watch is set up with ""Family Setup"" as long as it's an LTE model watch, you do not need to have it paired with an iPhone AT ALL...however (and this is a biggie) - you STILL need an iPhone to set it up initially. That sucked. But - I have enough friends with iPhone's that I took the plunge anyway.,The watch looks phenomenal BTW. I got the blue model and that new watch face that takes advantage of the larger screen is fantastic. Since this is my very first apple watch, I can't speak to how well it compares to earlier models, so I'm sorry about that. Honestly however, having not used a previous model before, I just don't see that there is a difference that is noticeable when compared to my friends who have earlier model apple watches. The major thing I like is exactly what I wanted most: a watch that is reliable. It took a bit of getting used to because I have been so familiar with Wear OS and Tizen watches for so long, but it isn't difficult, just takes a little time, that's all. I haven't always liked the apple rectangular shape...but slowly, it grew on me. It was always made really well, of that there has never been any doubt, but the series 7 is just great to look at.,The one thing keeping my review from 5 to only 4 stars was the pretty HUGE omission of the charging block. As you've no doubt gathered by now, I'm a android guy and always have been. My last 4 phones have all used USB-C chargers...but none of them came with blocks that the USB-C cord went into, they all had the USB-C port on only ONE end, not both. It's fair to assume the majority of apple users do not own one of these, either. Meaning, it's an unnecessary EXTRA expense you absolutely MUST make in order to even be able to use your watch - unless you have a charger from a previous apple watch which you can still use, but you won't be able to take advantage of the faster charging time. For what apple is charging for this watch, leaving this out is nothing shy of a ginormous cash grab on their part, and it's rather blatant and disappointing. Seriously guys, this is simple greed...and if anyone at their HQ bothers to read any of these reviews will note that there are quite a few upset genuine apple fanatics who really are quite upset by this same situation, so I am definitely NOT alone here. Wise up apple or you'll force longtime fans into the arms of Wear OS simply to make a statement.,With that said, the watch operates extraordinarily well. I have seen zero hiccups that I see each time I turned on my Galaxy Watch 4 (seriously, EVERY time I turn it on, I get a notification that tells me I have voice mail, but when I check, there is nothing there - literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I turn the watch on. After 3 months...it got old...and now it simply makes me mad). I've always heard of the great haptics on apple devices and now I know what they mean. Samsung does a pretty good job as well on their watches, don't get me wrong, but these are just, well, better. It's hard to describe unless you've actually worn one to feel the difference. My TicWatch Pro 3 is actually a pretty good Wear OS watch, it really is...however, the haptics are so friggin' anemic I miss 90% of my notification vibrations due to the poor haptic engine it has. (this is an issue with hundreds of thousands of other TicWatch Pro 3 owners...it's on many online threads if you're curious) That isn't the case here with the series 7. I get ALL my notifications and in a timely manner and that on-screen keyboard with swipe-like ability is fantastic. It's not as good as the Google keyboard, but it isn't far behind...and for quick text input, especially if you're in a loud environment where you cannot use voice dictation, or you're in a quiet place or you simply don't want people around you to hear what you're replying, this is a wonderful tool and it works pretty great. Kudos to apple for adding it. I want to mention the haptic engine again...it's actually quite impressive. It vibrates in a totally different manner than ALL other smart watches I've ever owned. It works beautifully and it is hard to miss a notification due to it's efficiency. I swear, if my TicWatch had a decent haptic engine and better music-transfer capability, I may never have even considered getting the apple watch at all.,This the only smartwatch besides Samsung to make transferring music to your watch pretty seamless. OR SO I THOUGHT. I tried almost a dozen different programs supposedly designed to help convert my mp3's to easily transfer to my phone and then onto my watch. Almost every one would cap you at transferring 10 songs per day ONLY - unless you paid money. Even iTunes was a problem saying that I had to change this setting on my phone in order to transfer music...yet no matter how often I changed the setting, it still said I needed to do the same thing again. I deleted iTunes and re-downloaded it and tried again. Nope. Same issue. I finally discovered a program called, ""SynciOS"" which allowed me to transfer music in a pretty intuitive manner and do it ridiculously quick. Not sure why it took so long to be able to do something so simple, but sheesh, this was essentially the only thing that really frustrated me regarding my series 7 watch. Samsung makes this process STUPID EASY to do and sorry apple fans, is FAR SUPERIOR to how apple does it. All other Wear OS watches are no better at making this an easy process and in fact, can make it even more difficult.,I love how on my hikes, while listening to music on my watch, I'll get updates every mile I've reached. This is another great feature...but its one that is done better with the Galaxy Watches. The Original GW and the GW3 and GW4 all give you this same information but goes a few steps further. Samsung tells you when you've reached that mile, but also tells you how many steps you've taken to get there AND your heart rate. It only takes 3-4 extra seconds and it works great. The difference between Tizen and Wear OS however is that with TIzen the music would halt while the watch reads out that info thru the bluetooth earbuds, while Wear OS it just slightly lowers the volume of music and tells you the information. Apple lowers the music volume much lower which makes hearing your metrics much easier, but still, the more information the better as far as I'm concerned. Yesterday I wore both my GW3 and the apple watch and they each marked every mile within probably 4-5 seconds of one another - or roughly 15-20 feet difference, which says they both were pretty spot-on for how they measured distance. They both were within about 7 steps of each other as well and heart rate were off by 1 or 2 beats per minute. That tells me either they are both accurate, or both are off by roughly the same amount. There may be a few workout routines that apple doesn't cover which Samsung does and vice versa, but they do all the one's I personally use regularly and that's what counts as far as I'm concerned. Great implementation, too.,All in all, you've made this Android user a convert. Though, I still prefer using my Samsung phone. Sorry guys.,***UPDATE***,Battery life compared to my GW4 is simply astonishing - especially considering how much people whine about it online. Case in point: yesterday I braved the snow and 15 degree temps and walked the 5 miles home from work for my exercise. I wore both my Galaxy Watch 4 and apple watch 7. Keep in mind before I left, I topped off my GW4 til it was at 100%, something I could not do with my apple watch since I do not have a spare charger at work like I do with my Samsung watches, which seem to need it more often. I will stipulate that after a few weeks using my GW4 the battery life improved significantly as it ""learned"" my habits and adjusted accordingly. I used GPS on both to keep track of my walk, and listened to music downloaded to both watches and switched from one to the other exactly at the half-way point to make it fair. By the time I reached home, my GW4 was down to 61%. Now keep in mind I had been using my apple watch since 5am that morning and wasn't able to charge it before leaving for home. When I hit home my apple watch 7 was still at 79%. That is astonishing to me...and an enormously HUGE difference. I have suspected the battery life was better, but not by THAT much. I just looked it up, and the 45mm apple Watch 7 has a battery size of 309 mAh, while the GW4 has a battery size of 361 mAh. Sorry, but this is a GINORMOUS apple win here. It seems every other review I read about the newest apple watch, one of the chief complaints is battery life, but when compared to the GW4, I cannot help but be happy with it's performance so far. After having used the apple watch for over a week, using the GW4 reminded me (again) that Wear OS just isn't quite there yet. The crazy glitches that plague this system, the incessant notification of voicemail that is NEVER there 100% of the time whenever I turn the watch off and turn it back on again, the notification that my watch is playing media that isn't there, or that it's paired with a kindle that I have never paired it with, the slowness of opening apps and closing them again, the problem of pulling down the settings menu and how it works about half the time I try to pull it down, or scroll up working only part of the time, or how I close all apps only to discover some still open - apps I've never tried to open since the day I bought my watch...the list goes on and on. You know what glitches I've had with the apple watch? NONE. Seriously. I haven't had one single hiccup since I turned this device on. I truly wished this were not the case with my Samsung. The honest truth is I wouldn't even have an apple watch were it not for my sour experience with the newest Galaxy Watch. I still hope that a future update will correct most of these problems, and if so, I will be thrilled to see them implemented and will gladly state so. Problem is, I don't think this is Samsung's problem, it's an issue with Wear OS and Samsung can only do so much to correct it. I DO find it interesting that my older TicWatch Pro 3 has shown far fewer issues and glitches than the GW4 in pretty much every situation...so maybe its a combination of Wear OS and Samsung's version of Wear OS 3.0. Either way, I've been very disappointed in my experience and wish that they had never switched from Tizen in the first place. Oh well. Time will tell if Wear OS can correct these issues or not.,The body composition feature is cool on the GW4. I really thought it would be more useful, though. I suppose it can be, but - for me at least - it simply hasn't been something that I've been able to get any kind of genuine use out of. Reportedly it can actually measure your blood pressure...but on a watch? I honestly cannot see how accurate that could be using any kind of method the way the watch is set up. Every reputable medical site I have looked at says the tech is far too new and simply isn't capable - yet anyway - of accurately being able to measure blood pressure monitoring. Kudos to Samsung for initiating it, but at this point, I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock on accuracy.,Charging...so, since this is my first apple watch, I can't compare it's supposedly 33% faster charging over previous models...but I WILL say it's faster than the Galaxy Watch 4, 3, Original Galaxy Watch etc. and my TicWatch Pro 3...however, I have an Oppo Watch (which was clearly a ripoff of the apple watch design, but in their defense, they did a STELLAR job with it), now that watch charges FAST. Exactly how much faster, I cannot say for certain, but let's just say all of those other models I mentioned pale in comparison. I just find it absurd that apple did not include a charging block. An utterly imbecilic decision.

David Lewis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I expected the latest watch to work seamlessly with the latest iPhone.  This is the latest watch.  I have the latest iPhone.,I'm in recovery from two episodes of a dangerous heart arrhythmia and my exercise program consists of approximately 1 hour moderately intense walks each day.  At minimum, I wanted the watch to count steps, maybe measure distance as well, and measure and keep track of my heart rate.  I also expected to be able to access this information fairly easily and when I wanted to on my iPhone as well as on the watch.,Apple buried the pedometer if it has one, and if it has one, you can't put it on the watch face I just spent a long time selecting as the one that I liked.  Apparently Apple restricts third parties from creating useful watch faces, so there aren't that many, and there isn't one I could put what I wanted on.,I installed a pedometer app.  I bought the watch having been assured by the salesman that this watch had or this watch even was a pedometer.  What am I doing installing a pedometer app?  This seemed like buying an iPhone and having to install a phone app.  If you know the watch OS, I hope it wouldn't take you that long to set this up just the way you want it, but I didn't have the patience.  I think I got the number of steps to display but then there wasn't a place to put the heart rate.  I expected less hassle for this simple function.,I opened the iPhone Watch app.  I'm sure there is a way to get it out of the Settings screen, but at this point, as I was about to refresh my perception of how this app wasn't that easy to use, I can't get it to do anything except alter various settings.  I can't back out of the Settings into the program itself.  I've only been using computers since 1982 or so, when I studied assembly language on a machine with 1K Ram and cassette tape instead of a hard drive, so it could be that I'm not capable of figuring out how to operate the easy to use Apple software interface.,I even have an Apple Watch for Dummies book, the latest edition.  I ended up looking online for solutions to problems as they came up because for me the book was full of a lot of tips and info except no info on the particular problem, whatever it was, that I had.,Apple doesn't even consider the type of exercise that I am doing at the moment, i.e. fairly gentle walking coming back from a serious heart issue, as exercise.  So they program their software out of the box to ignore the type of walking I do, so people say.  Maybe the watch can be tweaked or if I muttered the right incantation it might decide my walks are exercise,  but as I looked for info on how to make the watch display information about my proposed walks, the first warnings I ran into were that walks are not exercise in the Apple ecosystem unless they are of a certain intensity.  I don't know because I couldn't set up the watch well enough to even take it for a walk before I gave up and told my wife, who gave it to me as a present, that I was going to send it back.,The screen is beautiful.  The 45mm watch seems too big and bulky for me and I am 6 foot 1 inch with big hands.  The aesthetically appealing watch faces are the least customizable.  I made sure to turn the alarm off but it went off at 6:30 am anyway, and it would not manually stop sounding off every few minutes after that.  Etc.  I'm sure I could have found some setting other than alarm OFF that would have made the alarm not be set to go off tomorrow morning, but...

adandelion4you,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As already posted in previous reviews, this watch doesn’t come with the usb c brick that you need to charge it, so buy yourself one when you order your new watch. I already had one because I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro. That and the shorter battery life of this watch are the only drawbacks. You’re going to have to charge this watch every 24 hours. That being said, it’s a wonderful watch. It came in sealed, Apple packaging. The watch box was sealed on both ends. I mention this because of a few other reviews that complain of unsealed packaging and missing items. It has many features and I love that the health app integrates with the watch and you can view all of the data collected by the watch there. I ordered and received the 41mm. I’m a woman and I find that an adequate size for my wrist and I’m actually glad that I didn’t get the 45mm because it would have been too big and I’m not a dainty female with a small wrist. It has a lot of apps available and I took about a third of them off and that made the ones I wanted easier to view. It has a lot of watch faces to choose from and there are watch face apps available as well. I would have preferred a different color but with all of the watch bands available to choose from and different colors of hard screen protectors out there, it really didn’t matter and it’s a great price. I did purchase the offered insurance for $79 as well. All in all, it’s a great watch. The last comment I’d make is that something as basic as a wall charger that’s required to charge the product that you’ve just spent several hundred $$ on, should include it. Are you listening Apple? Probably not, oh well.

  É exatamente o que você viu até agora. Vídeo, foto, podcast, se alguém falou sobre esse macbook falou bem, e muito bem. Então já vou aos pormenores de antemão:,1. Ele é pesado. Uma coisa feita com essa carcaça belíssima, esse corpo perfeito, espaçoso do jeito que é, mesmo cabendo em um envelope de 23x30cm, não tem jeito, vai ser pesado.,2. É pontudo! Hahahaha, se alguém já segurou um iphone12 sabe o desconforto que é apertar ele ou ficar muito tempo na mão sem capinha, isso é muito estranho, mas mesmo com os cantos arredondados se você pretende usar ele no seu colo, vai se incomodar com a carcaça de traços bem definidos.,3. Essa ventuinha está quebrada. Sim! Impressionante, só dá pra saber que a ventuinha dele está funcionando quando você passa o dedo no corpo dele e seu dedo treme levemente, ao invés de derrapar. Nunca vi isso em toda a minha vida, realmente, fiquei besta.,4. Vem com uma base de 225gb de memória livre, na versão com 256gb.,5. A bateria não vai acabar, não adianta. Ela não acaba mesmo não, fizeram alguma mágica aqui. Eu to a dois dias, cerca de 11h usando desde a última carga completa, já fiz de um tudo aqui, até testei mineirar bitcoin com um programa em python. Pois é, a bateria segue firme. Agora fazem 23h, to com ele ligado desde as 15:30 por aí, caiu de 63% pra 20%. Nada mais a declarar.,6. Essa tela é surreal, muito adaptativa, mesmo! Meus olhos agradecem.,7. Esquenta sim ok! Mas só quando eu instalei um monte de programa um atrás do outro. Fora isso, ficou normal, e ele esquenta apenas acima da tecla esc, até o meio da touch bar, em nenhum outro lugar além desse. (acho que o chip fica ali).,8. Acabou, acho que isso é tudo o que eu nunca vi ninguém falar nos vídeos. Se você está pensando em comprar ele, compre-o, pretendo ficar com essa máquina por 10 anos, e acho que ficarei, assim como fiquei 11 anos com meu mac mini.,p.s. Ao vendedor, VOCÊ É DEMAIS! ENVIOU EMBALADO EM 3 METROS DE PLASTICO BOLHA, EU TE AMO <3

  Produto de extrema qualidade. O MacBook Pro M1 é realmente tudo que falam: bateria com muita durabilidade, ótima usabilidade do sistema operacional, diversas funcionalidade que aumentam a produtividade, sem falar do design que é muito moderno e minimalista. Sobre a compra, foi uma ótima experiência. O vendedor foi atencioso, respondeu todas minhas perguntas e fez o envio com muita rapidez. Recebi o produto muito antes do prazo. Satisfeito!

  O Macbook pro M1 é INCRÍVEL, é um computador pequeno, com uma capacidade e desempenho de gigante. Ele é caro? Sim, mas vale cada centavo, pq o bicho é ótimo!,A iiStore entregou muito antes do prazo, com nota fiscal na caixa e eu tinha pedido no chat e eles me mandaram, logo depois que enviaram o pedido para entrega. Foram atenciosos e responderam todos os meus chats, da um medinho pq ele esta num valor muito mais baixo, comparado com outras lojas, mas é original e todo perfeitinho.,A tomada veio padrão americano, mas se vc tiver aqueles benjamin ou tomadas antigas em casa, da pra usar normalmente.,Estou totalmente satisfeito, eu nunca usei um produto da Apple e realmente é tudo aquilo que escutamos por aí, é um produto premium!

  Hello. I’ve been eying the Series 7 for awhile as I had a Series 5 for a year and a half so I finally upgraded. I enjoy the slightly bigger screen, and brighter dispay along with better charging speeds and being able to use my old case and bands is a big plus in my book. To me it’s not much of an upgrade but you’re coming from a Series 3 and below then the upgrades will be major. People that complain about not having a charging brick in the box need to read the description as the description clearly says it doesn’t come with one so why complain about something that you should’ve known from the get go? They should do better research on what they buy next time and plus if you bought a new smart phone or even tablet within the last few years you should have a spare USB C charging brick laying around if not just suck it up and buy one Apple doesn’t include one so it can save on waste and declutters their packaging. The USB C Apple Watch cable allows the Series 7 to charge faster so I rather have a cable that allows me to charge my watch faster just in case if I forget to charge my watch or if I’m having a jam packed day ahead of me and need to charge it as much as I can so I can either get my day started or continue my day.

Ron,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The screen alone beats all else. Once somebody gets to see the screen of the watch, the thirst is filled. The biggest feature is the screen of the watch. I picked  it up frequently to look at it and then put it away.
"
Pyewacket,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have given this a lower rating of 2 because of Apple's stupidity. The watch itself is fine and should be rated higher. However, on the 7-series and on the latest iPad's, Apple has changed the charging cord on both ends. Both the insert connector to the power source and the connector to the watch (iPad) are different from previous versions and are not compatible with previous chargers. The power source can no longer be a USB port as the connector doesn't fit. And old charging cords cannot be used as they don't fit the iWatch or the iPad. This means you have to have double sets of chargers around, including automobile charges It is very annoying and irritating. Why did Apple do this?,In addition, I unplug the charger from my iPad at my own peril. When I reconnect it it doesn't always start charging. I have to fiddle with the connections on both ends, and even the AC adapter until it starts charging. This makes me leery about removing the charger to take the iPad elsewhere. It is not the cords or AC adapter as two sets do the same thing.,Is it just me or do others feel that Apple has gone downhill since Steve Jobs is not longer there.

Myocardium,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So this is my first fitness tracker / smart watch. In fact its my first watch of any kind for a few years. I tried the cellular version and then returned it a few weeks ago for the GPS only version. Primary goal of the cellular was to free myself from carrying my phone whilst going running. too many subscription based apps, however, made this impractical, so the data plan wasn't really of much use. Plus it chews through more battery (more on that later). So yeah I think the tech ability  is finally here but Apple's ecosystem isn't very friendly to bundling your own playlists, so I continue to run with my phone AND watch AND bt headphones. Boo. Friggin. Who.,I am guessing the white band of the Starlight model probably turns a lot of people off, but you should know that bands are really easy to change, and cheap on the after market. I love the look of the starlight watch frame with a colored band. it gives the watch both the ability to be uniquely fun but can also have a more conservative look with a gun metal grey band.,The touch features are fantastic, as are the health features like vital signs. I've compared them to a real pulse oximeter and the o2 readouts are within 1% every time. Even the EKG sinus rhythm appears quite similar to a 12 lead. Remember, though, that this feature will not reliably detect (rule out) a heart attack.,Usability is quite good, also. the mini keyboard is surprisingly easy to use. Sure its not your phone, but it gets the job done. Voice to text is great and I find myself using that more than the keyboard. After about a week it primarily becomes just a time piece on your wrist as the novelty wears off, but appreciable features include the ability to glance at texts without pulling out my phone, and the flashlight feature is very handy as well.,there are a number of plastic/rubber covers on the market. I bought a two pack for use when i'll be out in the yard or an area where the watch may see more abuse. its more difficult to apply than changing the bands, which must come off to apply a protective cover. The screen naturally looses a small degree of touch sensitivity but is still quite usable. Mostly I go about my business without the cover. the 7 purportedly has a more durable screen and in a few months of use now I've yet to scratch it.,My biggest complaint, other than the music options for going running, is the battery life. I find myself charging it two or three times a day. Not that it needs that many top offs, but I don't like seeing any battery dip below 50%. the nice thing is that the charge is quite quick and painless with the so-called hockey puck. I can't imagine how frustrated I'd be with previous generations that don't charge as quickly as the 7.,if you have small wrists go for the 41mm. Medium and large will probably be happier with the 45mm.

Jack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this as a gift from my wife for my birthday and I love it!  I had an Apple Watch (series 2) that stopped working a bit over a year ago. My wife got me this to replace it.,The jump from series 2 to 7 was dramatic!  I did research to find out exactly what was different and I was disappointed to find out that it still had an 18 hour battery life. However, through my experience it can last closer to 30 hours per charge. But I do only use it as a watch and occasionally a timer so I imagine that having an influence on battery life.,It also was fully connected and updated within an hour and came with about 80 percent battery life.,The only downside is that it doesn’t come with a charging brick however this is standard for Apple as they stopped including bricks years ago. You still get the cable though.,All in all I love it and I love the deep red color that this watch is!
"
J. Brown,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Save yourself time and money and purchase an earlier generation.  It's hard to justify this purchase price for marginal improvements from earlier iterations.  The Corporate Greed stinks, with their ruse of changing the prior iteration of charger to a USB system, so you need to purchase new stuff all around.  Yes, they include the cable with the USB-C, but the CHEAPOS don't include the plug.  Further, the one I received a couple weeks ago has been having non-stop charging issues and the battery life has been POOR.  Count on spending another $100 if you want the authentic plug and a second set.  Then again, maybe they're brilliant and they did all this nonsense to raise my heart rate to hit my fitness goals.
"
Diana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been wanting an apple watch, and finally purchased one.  I was a little leary with the battery life only being 18 hours, but it actually lasts for more than 24 hours!  I fully charge my watch each day (because I wear it to bed), and it only gets down to about 40% by the time I charge it again.  The calling and texting from the watch is awesome!  If you have been on the fence about getting one, then get off it, and buy one!
"
Dianne Thornton,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first Apple Watch. I bought it from Apple and I love it. Still learning all it has to offer. I am disappointed, however, in the display. This series is touted to be more rugged than previous series. I am not that rough and, after less than 2 months, I already have 2 large scratches (see picture). At first I had a plastic film on it, but once I got active, moisture accumulated underneath. There are/were no covers available, plus I didn’t want to add bulk to the already large display. Of course the warranty doesn’t cover this. Eventually I will use my AppleCare+ to replace it. :(

Kim R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So I’m only writing to say I have no idea what’s with some of these reviews. Okay no IT doesn’t come with a 9.99 block to usb-c. Big deal. If you can spend $400 bucks on a watch I think we can get that piece. It DOES come with the magnetic charger super fast charge chord that is $30 bucks. Also this watch syncs perfectly fine. I’ve bought 3 so far. For people that claim to be tech savvy but took 6 hours? I’m pretty with it still but other than saying did I want to sync it to my phone AFTER updating the phone it was fine. You buy a tech wifi product and it’s going to need updates but other than it telling and showing you how to sync up your phone there’s literally nothing to this. I bought it for my 82 year old mother . Showed her in minutes how to take an ECG, and pulse ox. Send a message, make a call, talk to Siri, set an appointment , reminder, alarm, Use the calendar , Set and measure her activity and set her ICE so if she falls and doesn’t get up the phone will contact us. For what it is and all it’s features , ease of use, this thing is amazing. I bought it on the $349. Price which really is pretty remarkable for all of it’s features. Lot’s of complaining here for something that’s a pretty amazing and bonus with an emergency alert for her to get help. I’m not sure how much people feel is okay to pay for all of this but for me it’s one of my favorite things and seeing my moms face light up and marvel over this thing makes me say it’s money well spent. Apple is a business, so is Verizon, Cable companies , service providers any many other monthly expenses that overcharge and don’t include all the accessories you need either. Apps are also money makers but some of them make our lives convenient. Go on you tube and look up how to set up your phones/watches. It shouldn’t take anyone 6 hours. From the time my mom opened it, while on a FaceTime call with my brother in Germany within literally 5 minutes it was syncing to her phone. Nothing difficult about it.

W. Herman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The iOS is horrible, frustrating, and counter intuitive. Want a stopwatch? Not on this device! Oh it has a stopwatch that is useless garbage. After one minute, the only thing it displays is 1:—:—. What genius thought of this? It’s not saving battery, the display is still on! You can raise your wrist and the numbers appear, but if I have a heavy dumbbell in my hand or I’m stabilizing it in my lap, I can’t move my wrist. Just have the flipping numbers on screen!! FFS. Do you want to know what minute you’re on after 70 seconds? Tough sh**, the screen switches to the time. So now you’re forced to bring up your wrist. And yes, I’ve looked up and changed every setting possible. Nothing I do prevents this. Well, why don’t you download a third part app? Hey, let’s try that. That was a massive headache itself and after I finally did download a third party stopwatch app that showed all of the numbers, the amazing, intuitive Apple iOS darkens and reverts to the time. Un-flipping-believable. Want to turn that setting off? Tough sh**, Mr. Customer, you can only look at the app for 70 seconds, so screw your three minute timer, peasant. “What you need to do is toggle the hide sensitive complications options on or off.” Guess what, that doesn’t work. Not after 70 seconds. While I’m talking about the display, sometimes an app view screen shows up randomly and I literally can’t do anything to get out of it. The only option I have is to turn it off and back on again. That’s extremely frustrating. Also, they need to figure out which direction the scroll when is used for. One screen the scroll wheel moves the screen in the direction you push the wheel (up is up and down is down), but when you go to move the cursor to edit text, down on the wheel moves the cursor up. Why? Why would they do this? Well we’re on the subject of text, the talk to text on this watch is atrocious. I can say the exact same thing on my iPhone and it works great. The watch simply does a turd job at understanding talk to text. When I do scroll down to go up and select a word to change it to something that I actually said instead of what it wrote, the options simply aren’t there. Ever. Also, when I’m on the workout app tracking my heart rate and I switch to a Stopwatch app to track my time in between sets, I looked down at my watch to check the time and it switched back to the workout app! That’s so extremely frustrating. When I switch to another app I want to look at that flipping app. I don’t want you to change to the time, I don’t want you to change apps regardless of what you think I want to see. It’s little stuff like this that makes me want to ask, will it blend? Sometimes I think putting it down the garbage disposal or in a Vitamix would make me much happier due to the frustration I have with the iOS. What stops me from doing that? The hardware. The hardware is really amazing. I love the way it feels in my wrist, I love the heart rate monitor which never drops my heart rate (unlike every Fitbit or Mio watch I’ve had). The screen is fantastic, the haptics are really nice and not overbearing. For the amount that this thing cost the fact that the software is so crippling there’s no way I can recommend someone purchase this until they get the iOS fixed.

A apple não tem isso, tudo deles cumpre e dura, por isso, no final o produto se paga. Pesquisei muito qual computador comprar e o vendedor e fiz a melhor escolha possível, pelo equipamento e loja! Recebi o note impecável, super bem embalado, e muito antes da data prevista. Antes de enviar fui contatada pelo Rafael, da ByTech Info, ele me mandou foto da pacote, me senti bem assistida e segura.

  Como desenvolvedor de sistemas, os principais pontos fortes são: performance (apesar de 8gb de ram, se comportou de forma flúida inclusive com simuladores mobile ativos), bateria (programando, com simuladores ligados, e brilho alto, consumiu aprox 40% após 5 horas de uso intenso... impressionante) e mobilidade (muito leve, fino e não esquenta muito, poucas vezes ligou a ventoinha). Ponto negativo: por enquanto ainda existem algumas incompatibilidades de tecnologias com a arquitetura arm64 do M1, mas em geral há workarounds para superá-los. De forma geral, uma excelente compra

  Thought Apple neglected to include a charger with a new watch and called customer service to check.. Was told chargers are no longer included to reduce the impact to the environment.

J D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't understand why people - even real techies are complaining about the charging situation of the watch.  Can't you read?  Need to do your due diligence before buying.  It says what's in the box.  You can buy an Apple 20W charging block for $20.00.  I guarantee you'll need it for the future.  You can also buy adapters.  If you just read what's in the box, you could have avoided lots of stress.  Everything would have arrived together.  As to the updates, from what I understand the updates need go in sequence.  If you don't have the latest, you need to update.  If you don't have one or 2 previous updates you need to add those updates first.  I am an old dog who hates to learn new tricks, Apple make things easier and I'm happier for it.  Thanks Apple

  This watch comes with no means of connecting it to electricity to charge it.  It has as C connection and they want another $19 for a plug that allows you to connect to the electricity to get a charge.  I went elsewhere and bought the charger, I refused to give them extra money.  It was not the $19 it was the fact that they would sell a product that could not be used out of the box.

  I speak for many in the track and field world who have tried and tried to enjoy Apple Watch as a fitness device. Problem is the lack of a physical start/stop button makes timing short races impossible. Whether you are timing yourself on repeat 400s or timing other athletes on 100s, 200s, 800s or miles. Fact is we sweat a lot on the track especially during summer workouts. We need a start and stop button!! Apple clearly hasn’t asked a track athlete’s opinion on this. The Watch is a great device for daily life. However it shouldn’t advertise as a fitness device. If stoping the clock during a summer workout is not possible this it is not a fitness device.

  I’m sure the product is fine, I can’t check because it’s a Xmas gift and I don’t want to mess up the setup process for my wife. However, the watch came already opened. This obviously did not come from the factory, nor did they even attempt to present it that way and it’s very apparent that somebody has gone through the box it comes in for who knows what reason. Just takes away from the presenting aspect. My wife now has to open a $400 Apple Watch on Xmas that looks like it came in a used box. Very disappointing.

  I had the series 3 for three years, and never scratched the screen — I use the watch daily and have a very active lifestyle. The series 7, within two weeks, I noticed a huge scratch on it and did not have any incidents where I would have scratched it like this. I googled this problem and discovered many people are experiencing the same thing. Apparently while it's more shatter resistant, it's less scratch resistant. Wish I knew. Definitely get a screen protector, I'm extremely disappointed to have such a gouge in a VERY expensive watch.
"
Philip Chan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My Apple Watch series 7 was a great investment because I use it multiple times every day: day of the month for writing checks, set timer for cooking, outside temperature, outside weather, battery charge, DJIA, tracking sleep. The quarter hour chimes keep my on track throughout the day and serve as a good antidote to procrastination.  The Infographics watch face allows instant monitoring of up to 7 functions (""complications"") simultaneously.  For me, one device on my wrist is more convenient than multiple devices in various locations:  in my pocket, on my wall, and on my desk.

OhioGirl,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing - I received this watch as a gift.  Turns out the charging cable is faulty.  Chatted with them online, they told me to go to an apple store who confirmed the cable was faulty after a long examination.  They didn't have any of the new usb-c charging cables and at first said they couldn't send one to me, that I had to come back to the store.  After pressing them, I was told that apple care would call me that night which they did.  They would send one to me as long as I sent the faulty cable back.  9 days later, it hasn't shipped and support continues to fumble around for a response.  They could send me an older model cable...they could send me a new dual mag cable...but no, they continue without a clue.  So much for a premium product and excellent support.  I'm sure the cable costs them <$1.  What's my time and frustration worth?  What's a bad review worth??
"
Rodney,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch face had a very visible scratch right out of the box. When I contacted Amazon support they directed me to Apple support and said I would have to send the  BRAND NEW watch in to be replaced. I think that is kind of ridiculous that I spent this kind of money on a watch that was damaged before I got it, and now I have to send it to someone else for repair. The Apple support sight is no help what so ever unless you have a software problem. I can't even just send the watch back to Amazon for a refund without going through Amazon support. At this point I just want to send it back for a refund, but Amazon and Apple are making that difficult!

  Performs perfect in almost every category. I use mine mostly with the apple pen and the sensitivity is mostly just right. Amazing speeds as well and incredible graphics. Only problem is the design, without a casing, the extended camera is always first to the base making the lens susceptible to damage. Best value for money if you ask me
"
Stephen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love it.  It looks great. I am upgrading from a series 4 44 mm which I traded back to Apple.  The pulse ox is a nice feature.  the screen is larger.  the usb c charges very fast.  The problem with apple watches is the battery life should last longer.  i haven't tested how long it would last, but i would guess 2 days with minimal usage, 1 day with daily use.
"
Gino V,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  You all know Apple rarely goes wrong. Just got the 7 series 45 gps-cellular blue one sport. Absolutely magic product. So easy to set up with great graphics, features, it’s easily the best smart watch by far from the rest. The only thing, battery needs longer life. Read few comments about setting this watch for 6 hours. C’mon people. Are u serious?? Took me no more then 20 minutes to set it up. Runs like a charm. Great sound on phone calls. Messaging is super. Highly recommended!
"
Alexander Fabian,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not worth the headache it brings. Now on my second apple watch (first one had to be replaced after a lengthy back and forth with Apple), setting up is a pain, especially with cellular. Multiple calls and mischarges to and from my cell carrier later, i don’t think the headache is worth the benefits.
"
人,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Takes hours to charge to 100% using a standard charger, so you’ll need the new expensive USB C charger if you want to cut down the time you’re unable to wear your watch each day. It also has failed to charge several times.,This watch is not that big of an improvement over the Series 4.
"
Seven,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  For all of you complaining of the Apple Watch not coming with a power brick need to learn to read. That’s how apple watches have always been sold. Pay attention before you complain over something so small that you could even get from a gas station!
"

  I received this watch for Christmas. The setup was easy, very user friendly. The device itself is beautiful and lightweight. I love all the health features, the app designs are intelligent and easy to figure out. My only complaint is the lack of a USB-C charger. Since this carver is relatively new, I don’t have one that’s compatible. It would have been nice for one to have been included in this purchase.

  Just bought two watches as gifts and can’t use them or set them up because the phones needed updates and we did that but now the watches are dead and there is only a usb-c cord but no block?! Am I the only one who thinks it’s insane to include a cord but no blocks?? Well I guess I’ll just have to wait for the holidays to be over to have a chance to go buy a charging block and make my gifts useable again. Thanks Apple.

  Hard to believe, but a charger adapter is not included with this product.  Apple was not even kind enough to mention this anywhere.  Would prefer elimination of $20 worth of overly elaborate packaging in favor of a basic charger adapter.  My watch is sitting on a shelf waiting for me to order and receive an adapter.

  I was hesitant to buy one of these Apple watches, I thought they looked a bit clunky and I was not sure I was going to use all (any of) the features. But I’ve been wearing it now for a couple weeks and I absolutely love it. The phone even rings on this watch and I can answer it and speak into my wrist watch, just the way they used to do in the old sci-fi TV shows… :-)),The ECG is great to use, as is the exercise and activity app.  Also I get news flashes.  Just love my watch!
"
Col. Bo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received this watch yesterday. I may rewrite or add to this review later. Day one didn’t go well. The first problem encountered was software update. That took over 30 minutes and then I had to put the watch on the charger to finish updating. An hour later, I began setting up the watch. Each click screen (Accept - do later), the watch froze up. Two hours after starting, the watch finally works, almost. The cellular phone feature didn’t work until 24 hours later. I placed the watch on charge again at 8:00 pm that night. I put the watch back on at 10:30 pm to go to bed with 100% charge. I use the watch as an alarm clock. I was awakened at 7:30 am. The watch showed 79 % charged. So far I have had to charge the watch twice a day. The watch comes with two small bands and no charger.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This was a great Christmas present. My significant other really enjoys to wear the watch, the original band that comes with it is also small enough for people with very slim spindly antenna like wrists to wear comfortably. It has many nice features including weirdly enough a strange ability to read how much oxygen is in your blood that has something to do with lights and colors and sounds and the feeling of being on a giant rock that is moving through space at incredible speeds, you are alive. Look up, look up, I see you now. You look nice, take care of yourself. Enjoy this product by Apple, goodbye!

  The brightness of the screen is the same as series 5 or at least to my eyes. the more disappointing feature is the Milanese band quality is not same as the series 5 one i have. The series 7 band kinks quite often  my series 5 band is constructed much better with a smooth jewel like feel.

  Love it, but I knew that I would. There are a ton of great features to the watch. The short band fit my wrist better and the additional accessories I bought fit nicely. Only downside was the late delivery.

  It’s nice… the price was not. Not sure about what all the hoopla is about with these watches! I took the bait after years of saying no… should have kept saying no.

John,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The 2020 iPad 10.2, which I own, was widely reviewed as the best iPad for most people. It blows away tablets from all other manufacturers, and will do most of what the more expensive iPads will do, albeit not as quickly and not as attractively. It's a great, excellent bang-for-the buck tablet for media consumption and light creative work (email, short documents). If you add a bluetooth keyboard, which I do, you can quickly bang out long emails and longer documents. It's a very versatile and portable device with an all-day battery.,That said, I'm upgrading to the 2021 model, which is a substantial upgrade over 2020 version at same price. Contrary to the statement by another reviewer, the improvement to the front-facing camera is a big deal. The resolution is markedly better, which is good for FaceTime calls, the Center Stage feature, which isn't available even on the iPad Air, is an upgrade for video, and the TrueTone display is more satisfying to many (I like it).,Moreover, the base memory for the 2021 model is, at 64 gb, twice that of the 2020 model which was pretty tight although usable at 32 gb. I bumped up against that limit a couple of times, so I love getting double the memory.,The 2021 model has a moderately faster CPU chip and substantially faster GPU (graphic) function, neither of which matter at this point for my use.,I probably would have hung onto the 2020 model which is adequate to most of my tasks, despite the relatively low memory. But Apple and a blue Big Box store offer pretty good trade-ins on the 2020. By taking advantage of price matching and trade-in of the 2020, I'm able to get the 202110.2 for $80. It's well worth $80 to me for the additional storage and the greatly improved front facing camera. You might be able to sell a 2020 for more than I got on the trade-in, but I didn't explore that.,In brief, the 2021 10.2 inch iPad should be on your short list for tablets--check out the reviews. And even if you have a recent model low end iPad like me, it could be worth your while to upgrade.

Anthony,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Trying to do an initial setup on a celluar model and after putting a sim card in and setup wifi, it starts the transfers from my old iPad. The transfer is using cellar instead of wifi. It took forever to finish it because the celluar signal at my home is not strong and mobile data speed is like 2-3mb at best, like wifi b protocol. I do not know why Apple decided to use celluar instead of wifi to do the transfer and there is no option to choose between the two. Why it cannot even do the wifi direct during the transfer since the data is transferred from old iPad to new iPad, either. Apple has failed to do the initial setup even though this is a good product otherwise.
"
The Doctor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I can’t believe this model costs so much less than the Pro version. This iPad is exactly what my wife needed. It’s still a 2021 year model, so it will be quite some time before it becomes too old to be able to update apps.,If you don’t need the absolute latest and greatest, this is an amazing bargain.
"
nana,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve had this iPad 2 weeks. It wouldn’t respond to my finger print.  I had to call help # & it took 2&1/2 hrs to get it restored. The next day later I went to use it & it said iPad unavailable.  I spent another hour on the phone to get it restored only to have it fail.  I was given mult choices local to have it checked / or new one given to me. I was told I had to have appt but none were close & I have to wait over a week & travel 40 miles!! 🤬

  Our PS4 was having problems, so we needed a new solution for streaming services.  We decided to get this and a chromecast, and it has worked splendidly.  We also got a 'childproof' case so that our little one can watch shows when we are out somewhere and he is feeling restless.  This is a great little iPad without paying the 1500$ pricetag of the 'pro' models.

Ele dura um dia inteiro, e se vc desligar a noite para o dia seguinte ele vai durar o outro dia inteiro também. Mas se ficar dia e noite ligado, só dá um dia! Acredito que seja, pq ele não desliga a tela, fica sempre acesa.,Mas eu amei o produto e o vendedor, o meu pedido chegou antes do prazo.,Vem com o cabo pra carregar, só não vem com o plug da tomada!,Recomendo!

  I am a college student and getting the iPad Air was one of the best decisions I could make. Online note taking makes lectures easier to digest, quick access to pdf files on Blackboard and (or whichever platform your school uses) and quick download/access to apps. Excellent buy!

  I like this iPad in general, from the price point, it's quite reasonable. However, if you are looking for one of these, you will be disappointed:,1. No 2nd gen Apple Pencil support;,2. No Antireflective coating, it's hard to read it under the sun;,3. Poor camera

Vyan Sylgo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Recomendo a compra!! Sabemos que esse produto é de importação então o carregador é pino americano, mas a economia em relação ao valor de compra no mercado nacional, compensa. O produto é original com nota fiscal (danfe consultada e foto da garantia Apple).,Depois de muito pesquisar, qual seria a melhor opção do mercado, optei por este modelo de 2021, os especialistas na área de tecnologia só tem elogios (com excessão da entrada Lightning). Recomendo e podem confiar na loja BLUE CHIPS STORE, a entrega foi via Sedex e chegou com 1 dia, bem embalado e com nota fiscal.,Muito satisfeita com a compra!!

Kevin P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Never did earbuds before, and I decided to try these instead of headphones. They allow me great versatility which I hadn't thought about beforehand. The sound is fantastic, and they work well with my Android. Definitely a good buy.
"
Gregory Burnham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So i have had every cheap pair of buds on the Earth.  I break them or one side dies out and they all sound like crap.  These are top notch and sound so good.  My daughter bought them for me for Christmas and i am very very happy with them.
"
Cat,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased these for my son, who had a pair before, but lost them.  He synced them with his phone, and as he started listening to music, the AirPods kept disconnecting.  I'm not sure these were new at all; maybe refurbished, but certainly not new.
"
Shivraj Biradar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pros: Integrate well with Apple product. Setup was quick and easy. Noise cancellation is on par with competition.,Cons: Audio isolation was good but overall audio quality is pretty flat. I use other premium bluetooth headphones in the past. This one is nothing compared to them in terms of audio quality
"
RandyLandry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have spent years buying and getting rid of different types of air buds. These are perfect. They’re comfortable, they have great sound, and they’re extremely lightweight. I also love that they recharge in their own case. I would buy these again if I ever needed to. I highly recommend them.
"
Jazzie T,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am a big fan of Bluetooth ear buds and have purchased several different brands in search of the best. I finally got these after they made them compatible with my Android phone. And wow! There is a definite difference in the sound and noise cancellation. I am very happy with this purchase.
"
SLam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Connection with iPhone is flawless. Connection with windows laptop is easy. Not much to complain about. The noise cancelation is alright for ear buds. The only earbuds that ever fit in my ear without falling out while running. (Because of the silicone tips)
"
Larry L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Feels solid in the ears. Noise cancelling feature is easy to engage. Sound quality is excellent. iPhone is clear both voice and reception. I only wish I could control the volume on the buttons vs. Siri or directly from the iPhone.
"
Natalie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am soooo happy I have these for an open office! Coming back to a office has been hard with sound for sure. They work great. They do hurt my ears a little when I wear them to long. But I have very small ears. They do come with 3 sizes to adjust. I would recommend for sure!
"
Khaled Mosharraf Mukut,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Nothing to say about these earbuds. Excellent sound. Another level. I was expecting a better battery life. But its fine as long you charge the case every day. The charging case becomes noticeably hot during wireless charging.
"
DivaMom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

Karla Medina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It arrived early and works amazingly. I used it all night and day and it’s 30% after almost 12 hours.,I wanted the rose pink one but the silver ipad is almost white, and easily to combine with cases and accesories. If you’re afraid of getting tired with the same color, go for the silver one!

Roxanne,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound is good but the battery life sucks. They last less than 6 hours. I like to listen to music when I travel and while I’m working so the battery life is very frustrating for me. I plan to return them.
"
A. Hall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these because they are more convenient to use than the corded earbuds, plus these Pros with the tips stay in my ears better. The noise cancelling is pretty good. I just wish they had a little better low end response.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Battery life is horrible and they are very uncomfortable. I am constantly pushing them back into my ears. The first gen ones were much more comfortable than these and you were able to double tap on one and it would disconnect a call, these ones you cant. Would not recommend
"
1giantleap,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had to use two different ear tip sizes and the troubled side always needs to be adjusted. It’s quite annoying in the gym. The non troubled side stays in for the most part. The design should be engineered to where it uses the structure of the war to hold the pod in and just the ear tip. Other than that, the AirPods are very good.

"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I opened these and immediately noticed they are dirty. The inside of the earpiece is CAKED with wax. The airpod itself has the L and R halfway marked off. These are 100% used, but I paid for the new pair. Got the notification on my phone that the owner of these was able to see my location. Definitely a scam, do not waste your time or money.
"
Viren Patel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love mine. Great for flying. Noise cancellation works great. Battery life I can’t speak on. Haven’t used consistently past 2-3 hours. But they hold up well during that time. Charge fast. Stay in your ear unlike the other ones. Coworkers use these as ear protection with noise cancelling for aircraft hangars so it works well. Just wish it was a little better. I use these and put some 30db protection muffs over them. Can’t hear a thing.
"
Julie G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My son got these for Christmas & he has paired them with everything! He has an android phone, PS station & switch that he's managed to pair them with so far so he's a very happy camper. They fit nice & will be a game changer.
"
Chen,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't usually write a review, but the building quality is really poor for an apple's pro product. The glue is literally leaking from the joint(yeah it's not earwax) and the accraccuracy of alignment is no better than a $10 earphone from a convenience store. This is not a suprise since I got the vietnam version. Apple, make it good or find someone else who can do good.
"
A Garota que lê romances,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  O produto chegou antes do prazo, bem embalado, com nota fiscal e tudo!!!!,Estou gostando bastante do ipad, a bateria dura bastante, ótimo custo-benefício. Uso somente para estudos e até então está suprindo todas as minhas necessidades.,A única ressalva é que o carregador é padrão americano, e apesar de na descrição constar que o vendedor enviará de cortesia um adaptador de tomada padrão brasileiro, o adaptador não veio. Enquanto não recebo uma resposta do vendedor, se o adaptador será enviado posteriormente, estou usando o carregador do iphone para carregar o ipad.,Muito bom mesmo!!!!! Vale a pena cada centavo.
"

  Foi uma surpresa descobrir que existe IPad a menos de 3 mil reais e que atende perfeitamente pessoas que não precisam de recursos extraordinários. Leio nele os livros que quero, os jornais, me distraio com jogos , mando e-mails , recebo mensagens, faço pesquisas, Tudo como sempre. E olha que meu IPad anterior era Pro, cheio de recursos que nunca precisei…
"
Paulo Rheingantz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Este é mei 5o iPad. E ele segue sendo muito conveniente, especialmente para quem utiliza outros dispositivos Apple, como notebooks, celulares. O unico senão é o preço salgado, mesmo em promoções como esta que me permitiu comprar. Mas não aceito muito bem a politica de obsolescência da Apple - tenho im iPad mini 1 wue não atualiza mais o OS, e com isso, deixa de rodar diversos aplicativos aprsar do equipe,a to estar funcionando perfeitamente. Essa política n justifica a manutenção das políticas de qualidade e preços da Apple. Produtos descartáveis n deveria ser feitos para durar tanto, e se ela mudasse, por comsequência, os preços também deveriam cair nastante, no nivel dos da concorrência.
"
Giovana Resende,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Chegou muito rápido, mesmo comprando no final de semana o vendedor enviou e veio com tudo certo. Tirei uma estrela porque a caixa chegou amassada e sem nenhuma proteção na embalagem, como espuma ou plástico bolha. O vendedor deveria se atentar a isso. No mais, tudo certo. Veio funcionando, completamente embalado, com todos os itens na caixa (manual, fonte carregadora e cabo). Compraria de novo! O preço que paguei valeu a pena, o mais barato que achei, ainda mais por ser de 256gb. Recomendo.

  Para quem quer um iPad moderno e que rode qualquer coisa, esse é o melhor custo-benefício.,iPad Air ou Pro são bem mais caros por poucas funcionalidades extras. Esse vale muito a pena se o uso for pessoal, navegar e jogar.
"
Lara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Esse é o meu segundo iPad, sendo que antes tinha o 5ª geração e troquei por esse exclusivamente por conta da canetinha. Acho um tablet de excelente custo-benefício, atendendo todas as minhas necessidades. O produto foi dado como “entregue” em um dia, mas só foi realmente entregue na manhã do dia seguinte, o que gerou um certo desespero - quem será que recebeu minha encomenda?,Fora isso, tudo muito bem embalado e entregue antes do prazo, como sempre.
"
Manuela Alves,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Gostei muito! Paguei um preço bom pq ele tinha acabado de lançar e gostei muito de tudo! Processador é muito bom, a bateria dura bastantes se vc não usar ele o dia todo para assistir vídeos no youtube ou netflix, se usar para estudos e pesquisas ela dura muito, quase 2 dias... ele é o modelo mais básico mas atende tranquilamente, a câmera é boa o suficiente, igual camera de iphone 7 ou 8... Gostei bastante e me atende nas minhas necessidades...
"
Eliete Iva de Sousa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Gostei do produto, atendeu minhas expectativas e chegou muito rápido. Como não fiz uso contínuo não posso mensurar a durabilidade da bateria, mas me parece boa. Recebi há uma semana, o carreguei, fiz as configurações e está com 45% de carga. Meu uso é para escrever, tirar fotos e navegar, portanto, o custo-benefício é muito bom em relação ao Pro e ao Air, de maior valor. Atende perfeitamente às minhas necessidades.

  O produto é perfeito! Veio super rápido (comprei dia 1/12 e no dia 2/12 já estavam me entregando!!) Por enquanto ainda não carreguei, então não sei dizer se carrega rápido. Bateria está durando horrores. Veio nota fiscal. Embalado e lacrado. A caixa veio um pouco amassadinha nas pontas mas como nada estava danificado não me importei. Não sei sobre os outros vendedores, mas o vendedor FrançaTech foi bem ágil no envio, apesar de não ter entrado em contato com eles pois não precisei. Se vocês tem interesse em comprar, cuidem todos os dias os valores pois sempre muda, e também sempre venham nos comentários p ver se tem bastante comentários positivos.

  Entrega antes do previsto. Apenas recomendo maior atenção na embalagem do produto, veio solto dentro de uma caixa de papelão, sem proteção, com a caixa do produto violada.

  I have never, ever had an issue buying AppleAir Pod Pros ($200!!) before but from Amazon its hit and miss. Time to avoid Amazon with Apple. It's a MESS. They don't work and now I have to return them and find a UPS store. What a pain in the BUTT. Wow.

  I love these the noise cancellation is amazing. I can’t really comment on battery life as I just received them today. I work from home and these will be great to use for phone calls. I was hesitant in buying these based on some reviews that they do not stay in ears but they are completely comfortable and stay in my ears. I was using the wired ones that come with my iPhone but these are so much more comfortable! Definitely recommend, I can use for work, walking, working out, just listening to music and calls!

  These buds are the best  From the spatial audio with dolby atmos to the noise cancelling. Sound is excellent I wish that they had more volume but as they are the battery life is outstanding and recharge quickly  I have bought a pair for myself, wife and daughter. We're all very happy and with the lower pre chistmas price I can't complain
"
Kristie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got these for Christmas specifically these ones because I heard the airpod 3s were really big to fit in your ears.  The only new thing with the airpod 3s is that they have spatial audio which the airpod pros do that to.  These also transparency where you can hear people which comes in handy.  The one thing I can say about that is that if you have long hair and turn on Transparency your hair is going to get close to mic of the airpod.  And the lid was a little flimsy but other than that these ARE AWESOME!

  I almost didn’t buy these after reading the reviews. A lot of the reviews said they were knock offs & used. That might be the case but mine came brand new in the box & sealed. They are exactly what I wanted & paid for!
"
Mohammed F Mithawala,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I adore the noise cancellation feature as it works very well. It is better than other flagship buds. The different silicone tips provided helps me find the appropriate size for gymming, running and when relaxing. Control of these with my Iphone is the most amazing feature I see. Battery life is average as I have to charge my buds everynight. The other reason for 4 stars is because the case material is slippery so it fell from my hands. I had to use a case plus the size is small, so it becomes difficult to carry around and remember without a keychain.

  It took half a day to set up.  I had to leave it with my iPhone within range of WiFi and connected to chargers while I downloaded a long series of updates and performed a long series of restarts.,The battery life is about 18 hours so I need to take it off to charge while I sleep.  This makes it difficult to use as a sleep monitor and use it as a watch all day.,The watch isn’t very useful without being always linked to my iPhone.  Now I have to have  Bluetooth on my iPhone always on which sucks battery life. Also, the watch/iPhone combo made the decision for me that my iPhone alerts are now silent and the watch will tap my wrist for alerts.  After missing a couple appointments I had to disconnect the watch by turning off Bluetooth.  I searched through the hundreds of settings and couldn’t find the one where I gave permission to make decisions about iPhone settings without my consents.,Apple doesn’t include power supplies anymore and they switched all there power cords to a new connector so I can’t use the 10 old power supplies I have sitting in a drawer.  Seems like a cash grab.  I guess they are out of ideas for new useful products that would increase sales.
"
tonydean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Everyone that is complaining about the ""surprise"" usb-c charging cable, you need to actually read before you buy. It clearly states in the item description what type of charging cable it comes with. Dont give the 1 star reviews over your own neglect of reading what you are getting. Those that had a hard time setting up the watch also  need to do the same. Do some research, and find out if your current firmware is what is needed to run the watch you are purchasing. So many people just leave negative comments when the item is great, but their lack of doing any reading, or research is their own fault. This is a GREAT WATCH PERIOD!

Jeff Gomske,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Okay, I've been an Android fan since, well, since the very beginning...I still am if I'm being honest. I have also spent a ridiculously large amount of $$ on smart watches over the years starting with the original Moto 360 (anyone remember that flat tire?). It LOOKED cool, especially that round face, but performance-wise, well, it was kinda terrible. The battery life was insultingly horrible (it would lose 7% in the ten minute drive to work while just sitting on my wrist doing nothing). But the potential was there. In finally switched to Samsung's Tizen at the introduction of the Gear S2. What a great watch that was. I went on to the Gear S3, the Gear Sport, the Galaxy Watch, the GW3 and then I heard the news: Samsung was going back to Wear OS. This disappointed me greatly. Over the years I have owned well over a dozen watches utilizing Wear OS (or Android Wear before that) and while I loved a lot about many of them, they ALL suffered from the stuttering and glitching that plagues essentially ALL Wear OS devices. Some have managed to work around that to produce the best version they possibly can (TicWatch Pro 3 and the Oppo Watch are just 2 examples) but each had at least something that just didn't work properly - and I don't blame either manufacturer for this. It's an ongoing problem with Wear OS itself. Slowly, I began to warm to the idea that maybe, just MAYBE Samsung will make it work the way it was always supposed to work. So, I bought the Galaxy Watch 4.,Did Samsung fix Wear OS? In a word: NO. It still suffers from glitches, hiccups and stuttering and apps not opening properly and/or timely. At times it works just great (which is more often than not, but still...), I have a fairly expensive watch that ruins what otherwise ought to be a smoother experience than what I'm getting. My Galaxy Watch 3 runs fantastic (it runs on TIzen software and not Wear OS) and honestly, I have had zero issues with it since I got it over a year ago, nor any with my previous Tizen watches including the Gear S2, S3, Gear Sport and original Galaxy Watch. I have had intermittent issues with the GW4 since the day I brought it home. To be fair, I have heard many people who claim that their Watch 4's have run flawlessly since they bought theirs...but I cannot speak to their experience, only the one I've had - but I brought it up to be fair.,I have done a LOT of research regarding all different kinds of smart watches, and you know what you almost never hear from the majority of apple watch owners? You don't hear about not getting a notification, or stuttering and glitches here and there. Sure, I'm sure they exist, but the overwhelming majority generally say the same thing: the watch JUST WORKS. Honestly, that is all I really care about. Does it do what it claims and does it do it consistently? From an Android Fanboy, I can say this without reservation: the apple watch works and does so CONSISTENTLY. I simply cannot say that about my GW4 or any other Wear OS device I have used over the last 6-8 years.,Okay, now why did I switch? Well, when I heard that the apple watch could be used without an iPhone, it really caught my attention. Seriously, an apple watch that can be set up so the user does not need an iPhone?? Well that's just what I wanted to hear. The truth is, once the watch is set up with ""Family Setup"" as long as it's an LTE model watch, you do not need to have it paired with an iPhone AT ALL...however (and this is a biggie) - you STILL need an iPhone to set it up initially. That sucked. But - I have enough friends with iPhone's that I took the plunge anyway.,The watch looks phenomenal BTW. I got the blue model and that new watch face that takes advantage of the larger screen is fantastic. Since this is my very first apple watch, I can't speak to how well it compares to earlier models, so I'm sorry about that. Honestly however, having not used a previous model before, I just don't see that there is a difference that is noticeable when compared to my friends who have earlier model apple watches. The major thing I like is exactly what I wanted most: a watch that is reliable. It took a bit of getting used to because I have been so familiar with Wear OS and Tizen watches for so long, but it isn't difficult, just takes a little time, that's all. I haven't always liked the apple rectangular shape...but slowly, it grew on me. It was always made really well, of that there has never been any doubt, but the series 7 is just great to look at.,The one thing keeping my review from 5 to only 4 stars was the pretty HUGE omission of the charging block. As you've no doubt gathered by now, I'm a android guy and always have been. My last 4 phones have all used USB-C chargers...but none of them came with blocks that the USB-C cord went into, they all had the USB-C port on only ONE end, not both. It's fair to assume the majority of apple users do not own one of these, either. Meaning, it's an unnecessary EXTRA expense you absolutely MUST make in order to even be able to use your watch - unless you have a charger from a previous apple watch which you can still use, but you won't be able to take advantage of the faster charging time. For what apple is charging for this watch, leaving this out is nothing shy of a ginormous cash grab on their part, and it's rather blatant and disappointing. Seriously guys, this is simple greed...and if anyone at their HQ bothers to read any of these reviews will note that there are quite a few upset genuine apple fanatics who really are quite upset by this same situation, so I am definitely NOT alone here. Wise up apple or you'll force longtime fans into the arms of Wear OS simply to make a statement.,With that said, the watch operates extraordinarily well. I have seen zero hiccups that I see each time I turned on my Galaxy Watch 4 (seriously, EVERY time I turn it on, I get a notification that tells me I have voice mail, but when I check, there is nothing there - literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I turn the watch on. After 3 months...it got old...and now it simply makes me mad). I've always heard of the great haptics on apple devices and now I know what they mean. Samsung does a pretty good job as well on their watches, don't get me wrong, but these are just, well, better. It's hard to describe unless you've actually worn one to feel the difference. My TicWatch Pro 3 is actually a pretty good Wear OS watch, it really is...however, the haptics are so friggin' anemic I miss 90% of my notification vibrations due to the poor haptic engine it has. (this is an issue with hundreds of thousands of other TicWatch Pro 3 owners...it's on many online threads if you're curious) That isn't the case here with the series 7. I get ALL my notifications and in a timely manner and that on-screen keyboard with swipe-like ability is fantastic. It's not as good as the Google keyboard, but it isn't far behind...and for quick text input, especially if you're in a loud environment where you cannot use voice dictation, or you're in a quiet place or you simply don't want people around you to hear what you're replying, this is a wonderful tool and it works pretty great. Kudos to apple for adding it. I want to mention the haptic engine again...it's actually quite impressive. It vibrates in a totally different manner than ALL other smart watches I've ever owned. It works beautifully and it is hard to miss a notification due to it's efficiency. I swear, if my TicWatch had a decent haptic engine and better music-transfer capability, I may never have even considered getting the apple watch at all.,This the only smartwatch besides Samsung to make transferring music to your watch pretty seamless. OR SO I THOUGHT. I tried almost a dozen different programs supposedly designed to help convert my mp3's to easily transfer to my phone and then onto my watch. Almost every one would cap you at transferring 10 songs per day ONLY - unless you paid money. Even iTunes was a problem saying that I had to change this setting on my phone in order to transfer music...yet no matter how often I changed the setting, it still said I needed to do the same thing again. I deleted iTunes and re-downloaded it and tried again. Nope. Same issue. I finally discovered a program called, ""SynciOS"" which allowed me to transfer music in a pretty intuitive manner and do it ridiculously quick. Not sure why it took so long to be able to do something so simple, but sheesh, this was essentially the only thing that really frustrated me regarding my series 7 watch. Samsung makes this process STUPID EASY to do and sorry apple fans, is FAR SUPERIOR to how apple does it. All other Wear OS watches are no better at making this an easy process and in fact, can make it even more difficult.,I love how on my hikes, while listening to music on my watch, I'll get updates every mile I've reached. This is another great feature...but its one that is done better with the Galaxy Watches. The Original GW and the GW3 and GW4 all give you this same information but goes a few steps further. Samsung tells you when you've reached that mile, but also tells you how many steps you've taken to get there AND your heart rate. It only takes 3-4 extra seconds and it works great. The difference between Tizen and Wear OS however is that with TIzen the music would halt while the watch reads out that info thru the bluetooth earbuds, while Wear OS it just slightly lowers the volume of music and tells you the information. Apple lowers the music volume much lower which makes hearing your metrics much easier, but still, the more information the better as far as I'm concerned. Yesterday I wore both my GW3 and the apple watch and they each marked every mile within probably 4-5 seconds of one another - or roughly 15-20 feet difference, which says they both were pretty spot-on for how they measured distance. They both were within about 7 steps of each other as well and heart rate were off by 1 or 2 beats per minute. That tells me either they are both accurate, or both are off by roughly the same amount. There may be a few workout routines that apple doesn't cover which Samsung does and vice versa, but they do all the one's I personally use regularly and that's what counts as far as I'm concerned. Great implementation, too.,All in all, you've made this Android user a convert. Though, I still prefer using my Samsung phone. Sorry guys.,***UPDATE***,Battery life compared to my GW4 is simply astonishing - especially considering how much people whine about it online. Case in point: yesterday I braved the snow and 15 degree temps and walked the 5 miles home from work for my exercise. I wore both my Galaxy Watch 4 and apple watch 7. Keep in mind before I left, I topped off my GW4 til it was at 100%, something I could not do with my apple watch since I do not have a spare charger at work like I do with my Samsung watches, which seem to need it more often. I will stipulate that after a few weeks using my GW4 the battery life improved significantly as it ""learned"" my habits and adjusted accordingly. I used GPS on both to keep track of my walk, and listened to music downloaded to both watches and switched from one to the other exactly at the half-way point to make it fair. By the time I reached home, my GW4 was down to 61%. Now keep in mind I had been using my apple watch since 5am that morning and wasn't able to charge it before leaving for home. When I hit home my apple watch 7 was still at 79%. That is astonishing to me...and an enormously HUGE difference. I have suspected the battery life was better, but not by THAT much. I just looked it up, and the 45mm apple Watch 7 has a battery size of 309 mAh, while the GW4 has a battery size of 361 mAh. Sorry, but this is a GINORMOUS apple win here. It seems every other review I read about the newest apple watch, one of the chief complaints is battery life, but when compared to the GW4, I cannot help but be happy with it's performance so far. After having used the apple watch for over a week, using the GW4 reminded me (again) that Wear OS just isn't quite there yet. The crazy glitches that plague this system, the incessant notification of voicemail that is NEVER there 100% of the time whenever I turn the watch off and turn it back on again, the notification that my watch is playing media that isn't there, or that it's paired with a kindle that I have never paired it with, the slowness of opening apps and closing them again, the problem of pulling down the settings menu and how it works about half the time I try to pull it down, or scroll up working only part of the time, or how I close all apps only to discover some still open - apps I've never tried to open since the day I bought my watch...the list goes on and on. You know what glitches I've had with the apple watch? NONE. Seriously. I haven't had one single hiccup since I turned this device on. I truly wished this were not the case with my Samsung. The honest truth is I wouldn't even have an apple watch were it not for my sour experience with the newest Galaxy Watch. I still hope that a future update will correct most of these problems, and if so, I will be thrilled to see them implemented and will gladly state so. Problem is, I don't think this is Samsung's problem, it's an issue with Wear OS and Samsung can only do so much to correct it. I DO find it interesting that my older TicWatch Pro 3 has shown far fewer issues and glitches than the GW4 in pretty much every situation...so maybe its a combination of Wear OS and Samsung's version of Wear OS 3.0. Either way, I've been very disappointed in my experience and wish that they had never switched from Tizen in the first place. Oh well. Time will tell if Wear OS can correct these issues or not.,The body composition feature is cool on the GW4. I really thought it would be more useful, though. I suppose it can be, but - for me at least - it simply hasn't been something that I've been able to get any kind of genuine use out of. Reportedly it can actually measure your blood pressure...but on a watch? I honestly cannot see how accurate that could be using any kind of method the way the watch is set up. Every reputable medical site I have looked at says the tech is far too new and simply isn't capable - yet anyway - of accurately being able to measure blood pressure monitoring. Kudos to Samsung for initiating it, but at this point, I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock on accuracy.,Charging...so, since this is my first apple watch, I can't compare it's supposedly 33% faster charging over previous models...but I WILL say it's faster than the Galaxy Watch 4, 3, Original Galaxy Watch etc. and my TicWatch Pro 3...however, I have an Oppo Watch (which was clearly a ripoff of the apple watch design, but in their defense, they did a STELLAR job with it), now that watch charges FAST. Exactly how much faster, I cannot say for certain, but let's just say all of those other models I mentioned pale in comparison. I just find it absurd that apple did not include a charging block. An utterly imbecilic decision.

David Lewis,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I expected the latest watch to work seamlessly with the latest iPhone.  This is the latest watch.  I have the latest iPhone.,I'm in recovery from two episodes of a dangerous heart arrhythmia and my exercise program consists of approximately 1 hour moderately intense walks each day.  At minimum, I wanted the watch to count steps, maybe measure distance as well, and measure and keep track of my heart rate.  I also expected to be able to access this information fairly easily and when I wanted to on my iPhone as well as on the watch.,Apple buried the pedometer if it has one, and if it has one, you can't put it on the watch face I just spent a long time selecting as the one that I liked.  Apparently Apple restricts third parties from creating useful watch faces, so there aren't that many, and there isn't one I could put what I wanted on.,I installed a pedometer app.  I bought the watch having been assured by the salesman that this watch had or this watch even was a pedometer.  What am I doing installing a pedometer app?  This seemed like buying an iPhone and having to install a phone app.  If you know the watch OS, I hope it wouldn't take you that long to set this up just the way you want it, but I didn't have the patience.  I think I got the number of steps to display but then there wasn't a place to put the heart rate.  I expected less hassle for this simple function.,I opened the iPhone Watch app.  I'm sure there is a way to get it out of the Settings screen, but at this point, as I was about to refresh my perception of how this app wasn't that easy to use, I can't get it to do anything except alter various settings.  I can't back out of the Settings into the program itself.  I've only been using computers since 1982 or so, when I studied assembly language on a machine with 1K Ram and cassette tape instead of a hard drive, so it could be that I'm not capable of figuring out how to operate the easy to use Apple software interface.,I even have an Apple Watch for Dummies book, the latest edition.  I ended up looking online for solutions to problems as they came up because for me the book was full of a lot of tips and info except no info on the particular problem, whatever it was, that I had.,Apple doesn't even consider the type of exercise that I am doing at the moment, i.e. fairly gentle walking coming back from a serious heart issue, as exercise.  So they program their software out of the box to ignore the type of walking I do, so people say.  Maybe the watch can be tweaked or if I muttered the right incantation it might decide my walks are exercise,  but as I looked for info on how to make the watch display information about my proposed walks, the first warnings I ran into were that walks are not exercise in the Apple ecosystem unless they are of a certain intensity.  I don't know because I couldn't set up the watch well enough to even take it for a walk before I gave up and told my wife, who gave it to me as a present, that I was going to send it back.,The screen is beautiful.  The 45mm watch seems too big and bulky for me and I am 6 foot 1 inch with big hands.  The aesthetically appealing watch faces are the least customizable.  I made sure to turn the alarm off but it went off at 6:30 am anyway, and it would not manually stop sounding off every few minutes after that.  Etc.  I'm sure I could have found some setting other than alarm OFF that would have made the alarm not be set to go off tomorrow morning, but...

adandelion4you,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As already posted in previous reviews, this watch doesn’t come with the usb c brick that you need to charge it, so buy yourself one when you order your new watch. I already had one because I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro. That and the shorter battery life of this watch are the only drawbacks. You’re going to have to charge this watch every 24 hours. That being said, it’s a wonderful watch. It came in sealed, Apple packaging. The watch box was sealed on both ends. I mention this because of a few other reviews that complain of unsealed packaging and missing items. It has many features and I love that the health app integrates with the watch and you can view all of the data collected by the watch there. I ordered and received the 41mm. I’m a woman and I find that an adequate size for my wrist and I’m actually glad that I didn’t get the 45mm because it would have been too big and I’m not a dainty female with a small wrist. It has a lot of apps available and I took about a third of them off and that made the ones I wanted easier to view. It has a lot of watch faces to choose from and there are watch face apps available as well. I would have preferred a different color but with all of the watch bands available to choose from and different colors of hard screen protectors out there, it really didn’t matter and it’s a great price. I did purchase the offered insurance for $79 as well. All in all, it’s a great watch. The last comment I’d make is that something as basic as a wall charger that’s required to charge the product that you’ve just spent several hundred $$ on, should include it. Are you listening Apple? Probably not, oh well.

  Comprei este equipamento pra substituir um modelo anterior que eu utilizo há anos e que começou a apresentar problemas de idade. Porém achei a duração da nova bateria aquém do que eu esperava. Sem dúvidas é mais rápido, mais leve e atende as minhas expectativas. Fornecedor me surpreendeu positivamente por entregar no prazo e por um preço inferior à própria Apple brasileira. Gostei!!

  Produto excelente, como já esperado de uma marca como a Apple! Porém a única coisa que fez com que minha nota não fosse 5 estrelas foi o fato do carregador ser padrão americano e não brasileiro, mas de resto não tem do que reclamar, produto tem um ótimo desempenho, assisto muitas séries e filmes e a bateria dura o dia todo tranquilo.

Truefreedom4711,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Hello. I’ve been eying the Series 7 for awhile as I had a Series 5 for a year and a half so I finally upgraded. I enjoy the slightly bigger screen, and brighter dispay along with better charging speeds and being able to use my old case and bands is a big plus in my book. To me it’s not much of an upgrade but you’re coming from a Series 3 and below then the upgrades will be major. People that complain about not having a charging brick in the box need to read the description as the description clearly says it doesn’t come with one so why complain about something that you should’ve known from the get go? They should do better research on what they buy next time and plus if you bought a new smart phone or even tablet within the last few years you should have a spare USB C charging brick laying around if not just suck it up and buy one Apple doesn’t include one so it can save on waste and declutters their packaging. The USB C Apple Watch cable allows the Series 7 to charge faster so I rather have a cable that allows me to charge my watch faster just in case if I forget to charge my watch or if I’m having a jam packed day ahead of me and need to charge it as much as I can so I can either get my day started or continue my day.
"
Ron,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The screen alone beats all else. Once somebody gets to see the screen of the watch, the thirst is filled. The biggest feature is the screen of the watch. I picked  it up frequently to look at it and then put it away.
"
Pyewacket,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have given this a lower rating of 2 because of Apple's stupidity. The watch itself is fine and should be rated higher. However, on the 7-series and on the latest iPad's, Apple has changed the charging cord on both ends. Both the insert connector to the power source and the connector to the watch (iPad) are different from previous versions and are not compatible with previous chargers. The power source can no longer be a USB port as the connector doesn't fit. And old charging cords cannot be used as they don't fit the iWatch or the iPad. This means you have to have double sets of chargers around, including automobile charges It is very annoying and irritating. Why did Apple do this?,In addition, I unplug the charger from my iPad at my own peril. When I reconnect it it doesn't always start charging. I have to fiddle with the connections on both ends, and even the AC adapter until it starts charging. This makes me leery about removing the charger to take the iPad elsewhere. It is not the cords or AC adapter as two sets do the same thing.,Is it just me or do others feel that Apple has gone downhill since Steve Jobs is not longer there.
"
Myocardium,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So this is my first fitness tracker / smart watch. In fact its my first watch of any kind for a few years. I tried the cellular version and then returned it a few weeks ago for the GPS only version. Primary goal of the cellular was to free myself from carrying my phone whilst going running. too many subscription based apps, however, made this impractical, so the data plan wasn't really of much use. Plus it chews through more battery (more on that later). So yeah I think the tech ability  is finally here but Apple's ecosystem isn't very friendly to bundling your own playlists, so I continue to run with my phone AND watch AND bt headphones. Boo. Friggin. Who.,I am guessing the white band of the Starlight model probably turns a lot of people off, but you should know that bands are really easy to change, and cheap on the after market. I love the look of the starlight watch frame with a colored band. it gives the watch both the ability to be uniquely fun but can also have a more conservative look with a gun metal grey band.,The touch features are fantastic, as are the health features like vital signs. I've compared them to a real pulse oximeter and the o2 readouts are within 1% every time. Even the EKG sinus rhythm appears quite similar to a 12 lead. Remember, though, that this feature will not reliably detect (rule out) a heart attack.,Usability is quite good, also. the mini keyboard is surprisingly easy to use. Sure its not your phone, but it gets the job done. Voice to text is great and I find myself using that more than the keyboard. After about a week it primarily becomes just a time piece on your wrist as the novelty wears off, but appreciable features include the ability to glance at texts without pulling out my phone, and the flashlight feature is very handy as well.,there are a number of plastic/rubber covers on the market. I bought a two pack for use when i'll be out in the yard or an area where the watch may see more abuse. its more difficult to apply than changing the bands, which must come off to apply a protective cover. The screen naturally looses a small degree of touch sensitivity but is still quite usable. Mostly I go about my business without the cover. the 7 purportedly has a more durable screen and in a few months of use now I've yet to scratch it.,My biggest complaint, other than the music options for going running, is the battery life. I find myself charging it two or three times a day. Not that it needs that many top offs, but I don't like seeing any battery dip below 50%. the nice thing is that the charge is quite quick and painless with the so-called hockey puck. I can't imagine how frustrated I'd be with previous generations that don't charge as quickly as the 7.,if you have small wrists go for the 41mm. Medium and large will probably be happier with the 45mm.

Jack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this as a gift from my wife for my birthday and I love it!  I had an Apple Watch (series 2) that stopped working a bit over a year ago. My wife got me this to replace it.,The jump from series 2 to 7 was dramatic!  I did research to find out exactly what was different and I was disappointed to find out that it still had an 18 hour battery life. However, through my experience it can last closer to 30 hours per charge. But I do only use it as a watch and occasionally a timer so I imagine that having an influence on battery life.,It also was fully connected and updated within an hour and came with about 80 percent battery life.,The only downside is that it doesn’t come with a charging brick however this is standard for Apple as they stopped including bricks years ago. You still get the cable though.,All in all I love it and I love the deep red color that this watch is!
"
J. Brown,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Save yourself time and money and purchase an earlier generation.  It's hard to justify this purchase price for marginal improvements from earlier iterations.  The Corporate Greed stinks, with their ruse of changing the prior iteration of charger to a USB system, so you need to purchase new stuff all around.  Yes, they include the cable with the USB-C, but the CHEAPOS don't include the plug.  Further, the one I received a couple weeks ago has been having non-stop charging issues and the battery life has been POOR.  Count on spending another $100 if you want the authentic plug and a second set.  Then again, maybe they're brilliant and they did all this nonsense to raise my heart rate to hit my fitness goals.
"
Diana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have been wanting an apple watch, and finally purchased one.  I was a little leary with the battery life only being 18 hours, but it actually lasts for more than 24 hours!  I fully charge my watch each day (because I wear it to bed), and it only gets down to about 40% by the time I charge it again.  The calling and texting from the watch is awesome!  If you have been on the fence about getting one, then get off it, and buy one!
"
Dianne Thornton,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first Apple Watch. I bought it from Apple and I love it. Still learning all it has to offer. I am disappointed, however, in the display. This series is touted to be more rugged than previous series. I am not that rough and, after less than 2 months, I already have 2 large scratches (see picture). At first I had a plastic film on it, but once I got active, moisture accumulated underneath. There are/were no covers available, plus I didn’t want to add bulk to the already large display. Of course the warranty doesn’t cover this. Eventually I will use my AppleCare+ to replace it. :(
"
Kim R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So I’m only writing to say I have no idea what’s with some of these reviews. Okay no IT doesn’t come with a 9.99 block to usb-c. Big deal. If you can spend $400 bucks on a watch I think we can get that piece. It DOES come with the magnetic charger super fast charge chord that is $30 bucks. Also this watch syncs perfectly fine. I’ve bought 3 so far. For people that claim to be tech savvy but took 6 hours? I’m pretty with it still but other than saying did I want to sync it to my phone AFTER updating the phone it was fine. You buy a tech wifi product and it’s going to need updates but other than it telling and showing you how to sync up your phone there’s literally nothing to this. I bought it for my 82 year old mother . Showed her in minutes how to take an ECG, and pulse ox. Send a message, make a call, talk to Siri, set an appointment , reminder, alarm, Use the calendar , Set and measure her activity and set her ICE so if she falls and doesn’t get up the phone will contact us. For what it is and all it’s features , ease of use, this thing is amazing. I bought it on the $349. Price which really is pretty remarkable for all of it’s features. Lot’s of complaining here for something that’s a pretty amazing and bonus with an emergency alert for her to get help. I’m not sure how much people feel is okay to pay for all of this but for me it’s one of my favorite things and seeing my moms face light up and marvel over this thing makes me say it’s money well spent. Apple is a business, so is Verizon, Cable companies , service providers any many other monthly expenses that overcharge and don’t include all the accessories you need either. Apps are also money makers but some of them make our lives convenient. Go on you tube and look up how to set up your phones/watches. It shouldn’t take anyone 6 hours. From the time my mom opened it, while on a FaceTime call with my brother in Germany within literally 5 minutes it was syncing to her phone. Nothing difficult about it.
"
W. Herman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The iOS is horrible, frustrating, and counter intuitive. Want a stopwatch? Not on this device! Oh it has a stopwatch that is useless garbage. After one minute, the only thing it displays is 1:—:—. What genius thought of this? It’s not saving battery, the display is still on! You can raise your wrist and the numbers appear, but if I have a heavy dumbbell in my hand or I’m stabilizing it in my lap, I can’t move my wrist. Just have the flipping numbers on screen!! FFS. Do you want to know what minute you’re on after 70 seconds? Tough sh**, the screen switches to the time. So now you’re forced to bring up your wrist. And yes, I’ve looked up and changed every setting possible. Nothing I do prevents this. Well, why don’t you download a third part app? Hey, let’s try that. That was a massive headache itself and after I finally did download a third party stopwatch app that showed all of the numbers, the amazing, intuitive Apple iOS darkens and reverts to the time. Un-flipping-believable. Want to turn that setting off? Tough sh**, Mr. Customer, you can only look at the app for 70 seconds, so screw your three minute timer, peasant. “What you need to do is toggle the hide sensitive complications options on or off.” Guess what, that doesn’t work. Not after 70 seconds. While I’m talking about the display, sometimes an app view screen shows up randomly and I literally can’t do anything to get out of it. The only option I have is to turn it off and back on again. That’s extremely frustrating. Also, they need to figure out which direction the scroll when is used for. One screen the scroll wheel moves the screen in the direction you push the wheel (up is up and down is down), but when you go to move the cursor to edit text, down on the wheel moves the cursor up. Why? Why would they do this? Well we’re on the subject of text, the talk to text on this watch is atrocious. I can say the exact same thing on my iPhone and it works great. The watch simply does a turd job at understanding talk to text. When I do scroll down to go up and select a word to change it to something that I actually said instead of what it wrote, the options simply aren’t there. Ever. Also, when I’m on the workout app tracking my heart rate and I switch to a Stopwatch app to track my time in between sets, I looked down at my watch to check the time and it switched back to the workout app! That’s so extremely frustrating. When I switch to another app I want to look at that flipping app. I don’t want you to change to the time, I don’t want you to change apps regardless of what you think I want to see. It’s little stuff like this that makes me want to ask, will it blend? Sometimes I think putting it down the garbage disposal or in a Vitamix would make me much happier due to the frustration I have with the iOS. What stops me from doing that? The hardware. The hardware is really amazing. I love the way it feels in my wrist, I love the heart rate monitor which never drops my heart rate (unlike every Fitbit or Mio watch I’ve had). The screen is fantastic, the haptics are really nice and not overbearing. For the amount that this thing cost the fact that the software is so crippling there’s no way I can recommend someone purchase this until they get the iOS fixed.

Fray,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was reading reviews about it and they were mostly positive. The AirPods are good in sound quality but not as much in noice cancellation. I am returning them because they fall out of my ear when i work and after 20mins my ear start to hurt AND BAD!,BUT, this is a personal problem for me since my ears aren’t as big. I tried all 3 size ear tips but it’s the same result; ears hurt or won’t stay in my ear. I will try the Beats Fit Pro since my co-workers use them. They love them! So will give those a go.

  I enjoy the no wires and portability of the AirPods. Buying them on sale took some of the sting out of the purchase. Sound quality is really good, battery life is good. Noise canceling is good compared to other ear pods. I would buy them again, but only on sale.
"
Andrew,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound experience is the best I tried so far. The more disappointed was I when the air pods kept falling out.  I'm going to buy foam tips to try and will write update. I was surprised how quickly the batteries go out.

  Originally purchased the Sony 1000 anc which were great ( When the worked ) but were too bulky, ANC pairing was cumbersome, cut in and out the finally stopped working. Apple earbuds? Phenomenal
"
liz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Apple support. Their conclusion is that the item is defective. I'm trying to replace them but keep getting error messages when I click on ""return/replace"". Would be grateful if someone could contact me directly about this.
"
J Rizzo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Noise cancelation is great. Audio is good. They stay in your ears as long as you don’t smile or chew or lay down. The fit on my old AirPods was a little better, but those died because they weren’t sweat proof.
"
Cassie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods were a Christmas present for my boyfriend and is in love with them! He used them every day since Christmas, unless they’re charging. They last pretty long. When he first used them he didn’t charge them very long they lasted 2 days when listening to music. Only thing that sucks is when you’re talking someone, like OTP, they lasted for only 8 hours. Other wise they are wonderful. I’ll definitely be buying me a pair!
"
chailin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This New AirPods Pro sold by Amazon and “Manufactured by Apple”  have giving me A lot of Problems, the connection is terrible, the noise cancellation works whenever it wants too, same for Transparency, I have fixed the settings and the problem remains. I highly think this Apple Airpod Pros are a Fraud sold by Amazon. Unless Apple sells their damaged Air pod Pros to Amazon for them to sell at a cheaper price. It’s a headache they are not providing what the details about device says. It’s called false Advertisement and Scam !!!!!!!!
"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My biggest response is Wow!!!  I wasn’t sure when ordering, but I absolutely love them. The sound quality, battery life are terrific. They stay in my ears, perfect size. Would highly recommend!
"
Sheila A Balnis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really didn’t know all the cool stuff these could do - thought they were just ‘wireless’. Various audio controls to amplify sounds (I’m a hearing aid candidate, I think). You can cancel sounds OR amplify…and adjust the sounds. Blue tooth. Diff setttings. Can connect to pc. Good stuff.
"
Derrick Copeland,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Overall a super great experience with these way better than my last AirPods I had the second generation. But there was a little issue when I first got them they just needed to be updated I took them to the Apple store and they updated them for me and now they’re working great I’m so happy with them not a single regret with this buy!
"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The product was listed as new but when I tried to hook them up by Bluetooth someone else’s email address showed up that they had already been attached to. Very disappointed!!
"
Jacob wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These things are great although does seem to fit in your ears a different way kinda feel like they will fall out but the pass though is amazing it makes feel like I’m in a movie and can have any sound track I want and quiet mode puts you in your own little world
"
Erin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Previously opened and paired, these air pods are not “new” at all. Very disappointed in the seller for being intentionally deceptive/misleading.
"
Mimz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve tried the three tip sizes that come with the earbuds and none work. It’s unfortunate because they have great sound quality and I love the noise cancellation and how quick they charge .
"
Sumdudewithtoolittletime,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you’re like me and are tired of getting cheap by ear buds, just get these. The  Sound cancellation is insanely good, sound quality is pretty decent for earbuds and the are comfortable in all situations.
"
Santiago G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excelente producto, muy fino, duradero y fácil de usar, lo único es que deberían de mejorar un poco las gomas ya que después de un rato de uso los audífonos tienden a caersen al suelo
"
Vicki Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These have spoiled me. Other earbuds do not fit my ear very well. I can count on these staying put and also giving me the best quality available. The sound cancelling is unbelievable!!!
"
cliffbrown,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not so pleased. There’s hardly any bass and more of a flat sound. I’m used to Bose and It was a toss up between quiet comfort noise cancellation or these, should’ve opted for Bose.
"
deirdre dingman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The airpods are hard to get in and out of the case, they are easily dropped and they do fall out of the ears too. Also, the clicking instead of tapping is a negative in my opinion.
"
cbell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The noise cancellation these are almost too good.  My kids have come up on me while using and totally surprised me because the background noise is just gone.  Of course you always want batteries to last forever…
"
SlavaSvitsky,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This brand getting more and more complicated in simple things. My messages not working on watch. Brand new just bought it. spend half a day with apple support and it looks like they don't know what to do. Samsung never failed me and easy to set up all messages and notifications flawlessly working. This garbage going back to apple. For $460? lol. what a crap
"
MC in Phx,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Thought Apple neglected to include a charger with a new watch and called customer service to check.. Was told chargers are no longer included to reduce the impact to the environment. If you believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and Apple worrying about the environment! I have some ocean front property for sale in Yuma, Arizona. So angry about being fleeced for another charger…
"
J D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't understand why people - even real techies are complaining about the charging situation of the watch.  Can't you read?  Need to do your due diligence before buying.  It says what's in the box.  You can buy an Apple 20W charging block for $20.00.  I guarantee you'll need it for the future.  You can also buy adapters.  If you just read what's in the box, you could have avoided lots of stress.  Everything would have arrived together.  As to the updates, from what I understand the updates need go in sequence.  If you don't have the latest, you need to update.  If you don't have one or 2 previous updates you need to add those updates first.  I am an old dog who hates to learn new tricks, Apple make things easier and I'm happier for it.  Thanks Apple
"
MM,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This watch comes with no means of connecting it to electricity to charge it.  It has as C connection and they want another $19 for a plug that allows you to connect to the electricity to get a charge.  I went elsewhere and bought the charger, I refused to give them extra money.  It was not the $19 it was the fact that they would sell a product that could not be used out of the box.
"
Madison Jones,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I speak for many in the track and field world who have tried and tried to enjoy Apple Watch as a fitness device. Problem is the lack of a physical start/stop button makes timing short races impossible. Whether you are timing yourself on repeat 400s or timing other athletes on 100s, 200s, 800s or miles. Fact is we sweat a lot on the track especially during summer workouts. We need a start and stop button!! Apple clearly hasn’t asked a track athlete’s opinion on this. The Watch is a great device for daily life. However it shouldn’t advertise as a fitness device. If stoping the clock during a summer workout is not possible this it is not a fitness device.
"
Rayz Z,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m sure the product is fine, I can’t check because it’s a Xmas gift and I don’t want to mess up the setup process for my wife. However, the watch came already opened. This obviously did not come from the factory, nor did they even attempt to present it that way and it’s very apparent that somebody has gone through the box it comes in for who knows what reason. Just takes away from the presenting aspect. My wife now has to open a $400 Apple Watch on Xmas that looks like it came in a used box. Very disappointing.
"
Rural Internet Shopper,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the series 3 for three years, and never scratched the screen — I use the watch daily and have a very active lifestyle. The series 7, within two weeks, I noticed a huge scratch on it and did not have any incidents where I would have scratched it like this. I googled this problem and discovered many people are experiencing the same thing. Apparently while it's more shatter resistant, it's less scratch resistant. Wish I knew. Definitely get a screen protector, I'm extremely disappointed to have such a gouge in a VERY expensive watch.
"
Philip Chan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My Apple Watch series 7 was a great investment because I use it multiple times every day: day of the month for writing checks, set timer for cooking, outside temperature, outside weather, battery charge, DJIA, tracking sleep. The quarter hour chimes keep my on track throughout the day and serve as a good antidote to procrastination.  The Infographics watch face allows instant monitoring of up to 7 functions (""complications"") simultaneously.  For me, one device on my wrist is more convenient than multiple devices in various locations:  in my pocket, on my wall, and on my desk.
"
OhioGirl,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing - I received this watch as a gift.  Turns out the charging cable is faulty.  Chatted with them online, they told me to go to an apple store who confirmed the cable was faulty after a long examination.  They didn't have any of the new usb-c charging cables and at first said they couldn't send one to me, that I had to come back to the store.  After pressing them, I was told that apple care would call me that night which they did.  They would send one to me as long as I sent the faulty cable back.  9 days later, it hasn't shipped and support continues to fumble around for a response.  They could send me an older model cable...they could send me a new dual mag cable...but no, they continue without a clue.  So much for a premium product and excellent support.  I'm sure the cable costs them <$1.  What's my time and frustration worth?  What's a bad review worth??
"
Rodney,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The watch face had a very visible scratch right out of the box. When I contacted Amazon support they directed me to Apple support and said I would have to send the  BRAND NEW watch in to be replaced. I think that is kind of ridiculous that I spent this kind of money on a watch that was damaged before I got it, and now I have to send it to someone else for repair. The Apple support sight is no help what so ever unless you have a software problem. I can't even just send the watch back to Amazon for a refund without going through Amazon support. At this point I just want to send it back for a refund, but Amazon and Apple are making that difficult!

  Love it.  It looks great. I am upgrading from a series 4 44 mm which I traded back to Apple.  The pulse ox is a nice feature.  the screen is larger.  the usb c charges very fast.  The problem with apple watches is the battery life should last longer.  i haven't tested how long it would last, but i would guess 2 days with minimal usage, 1 day with daily use.
"
Gino V,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  You all know Apple rarely goes wrong. Just got the 7 series 45 gps-cellular blue one sport. Absolutely magic product. So easy to set up with great graphics, features, it’s easily the best smart watch by far from the rest. The only thing, battery needs longer life. Read few comments about setting this watch for 6 hours. C’mon people. Are u serious?? Took me no more then 20 minutes to set it up. Runs like a charm. Great sound on phone calls. Messaging is super. Highly recommended!
"
Alexander Fabian,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not worth the headache it brings. Now on my second apple watch (first one had to be replaced after a lengthy back and forth with Apple), setting up is a pain, especially with cellular. Multiple calls and mischarges to and from my cell carrier later, i don’t think the headache is worth the benefits.
"
人,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Takes hours to charge to 100% using a standard charger, so you’ll need the new expensive USB C charger if you want to cut down the time you’re unable to wear your watch each day. It also has failed to charge several times.,This watch is not that big of an improvement over the Series 4.
"
Seven,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  For all of you complaining of the Apple Watch not coming with a power brick need to learn to read. That’s how apple watches have always been sold. Pay attention before you complain over something so small that you could even get from a gas station!
"

  I received this watch for Christmas. The setup was easy, very user friendly. The device itself is beautiful and lightweight. I love all the health features, the app designs are intelligent and easy to figure out. My only complaint is the lack of a USB-C charger. Since this carver is relatively new, I don’t have one that’s compatible. It would have been nice for one to have been included in this purchase.

  I'm so happy these come in three different sizes.  I have small ears and none of the prior ear buds apple sold fit comfortably.  I love the sound.  Not great at noise cancelling.
"
Buyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have owned many sets of earbuds and headphones throughout the years, absolutely nothing compares to the price point and quality of these. The noise cancellation is hilariously good, and will prove to be useful, couldn’t even hear the person in front of me. Great price on amazon, and great gift to family or even yourself.
"
Tait Hunter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Definitely not here to call anyone a liar. But, these are AMAZING and definitely legit Apple AirPods. I’m not sure why some have received fakes or used ones, so I won’t comment there, but the ones I got are very real and in perfect shape. I was not prepared for the noise cancellation! It’s so so good, you really can’t hear anything outside of the music. The fit is comfortable and the sound quality is great! You don’t get a charging brick but that’s the only downside.
"
Inka3k,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was excited to get these airpods, but after trying them out I definitely prefer the older models. These ear pieces are not nearly as comfortable and the design isn't as good.
"
B. Petri,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ear buds kept falling out.  Changed to small and it was a better fit but they still want to fall out occasionally even when setting at work desk.  Apple needs to rethink the fit.
"
R. Decker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is my first set of air pods. I did not like the previous versions because they were not comfortable and they let too much sound in. The noise cancellation is these is amazing. Sound volume is a little low but you really do not need it loud because the noise cancellation is so good.
"

  Hard to believe, but a charger adapter is not included with this product.  Apple was not even kind enough to mention this anywhere.

  I was hesitant to buy one of these Apple watches, I thought they looked a bit clunky and I was not sure I was going to use all (any of) the features. But I’ve been wearing it now for a couple weeks and I absolutely love it. The phone even rings on this watch and I can answer it and speak into my wrist watch, just the way they used to do in the old sci-fi TV shows… :-)),The ECG is great to use, as is the exercise and activity app.  Also I get news flashes.  Just love my watch!
"
Col. Bo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received this watch yesterday. I may rewrite or add to this review later. Day one didn’t go well. The first problem encountered was software update. That took over 30 minutes and then I had to put the watch on the charger to finish updating. An hour later, I began setting up the watch. Each click screen (Accept - do later), the watch froze up. Two hours after starting, the watch finally works, almost. The cellular phone feature didn’t work until 24 hours later. I placed the watch on charge again at 8:00 pm that night. I put the watch back on at 10:30 pm to go to bed with 100% charge. I use the watch as an alarm clock. I was awakened at 7:30 am. The watch showed 79 % charged. So far I have had to charge the watch twice a day. The watch comes with two small bands and no charger.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This was a great Christmas present. My significant other really enjoys to wear the watch, the original band that comes with it is also small enough for people with very slim spindly antenna like wrists to wear comfortably. It has many nice features including weirdly enough a strange ability to read how much oxygen is in your blood that has something to do with lights and colors and sounds and the feeling of being on a giant rock that is moving through space at incredible speeds, you are alive. Look up, look up, I see you now. You look nice, take care of yourself. Enjoy this product by Apple, goodbye!

  It’s certainly bold, the red. I am going from green, pink and now red. I so happy I did..,This is just beautifully made, feature rich and quality.

Me ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The brightness of the screen is the same as series 5 or at least to my eyes. the more disappointing feature is the Milanese band quality is not same as the series 5 one i have. The series 7 band kinks quite often  my series 5 band is constructed much better with a smooth jewel like feel.

  I don't know why this product got these good reviews. I think they have sent me the fake one. Microphone has annoying noise and even fake AirPods are better than it. I am completely unsatisfied with the product and I also scare of returning because of returning policies.
"
Kim Kerk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The noise cancelling feature of these AirPodPros is almost freaky.  It’s like someone flips a switch and suddenly it’s so quiet! These were a Chris gift for my daughter…upgrading from an older version, and she loves them
"

"
ym,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The earbuds works okay, though the sound and noise cancelation are not as good as WF 1000 XM4, it is much comfortable.,The main issue is the product quality control. My right earbuds has rustling sound when turn noise cancelation on. I went to an Apple store, they use a machine to test it. They said nothing wrong with it. I compare mine with another pair, definitely you can find it doesn't work well. Finally, I have to request to exchange a new one. Hope everything works fine with the new one.

Jamie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They didn’t work when I got them. They wouldn’t connect to my phone. I sent them back on November 27th and still haven’t gotten a refund. And entire MONTH to ship back items? Seems fishy
"
Scott Randlett,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Got apple care+ with these, but beware that even with spending the extra $30 that having them lost or stolen is not covered even with the extra warranty. Great headphones, a bit overpriced, but very disappointed that I was able to enjoy them less than 1 month
"
Nathanel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This are real, they are assembled in Vietnam. There is no problem but the bass and transparency is Amazing but the noise cancellation is not that good. I searched up my serial number on the apple website and turns out they are real, they come with 1 year of limited warranty but don’t get your used because user once are from other fake companies. For an example they buy them and return them with fake AirPods. These compared to the beats studio buds AirPods Pro is better.

"
CC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love it, but I knew that I would. There are a ton of great features to the watch. The short band fit my wrist better and the additional accessories I bought fit nicely. Only downside was the late delivery.

L. Cushler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was walking my dog wearing my new AirPods and a big pickup truck went by and I could hardly hear it. I thought it was a fluke when more traffic went by and everything sounded like an electric vehicle. I didn’t realize the noise canceling feature was an aspect of the AirPods.  They fit perfectly in my ears right out of the box. The only thing I was disappointed in was that they didn’t come with a USB charger.
"
AlphSig71,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Love this airpod pro, everything they said is true. Noise cancellation is very good. The buds fit perfectly ( small ones ). I changed out the ones that comes with it. I did the fit test, it was perfect. I love these airpod pro. The price was right too. Buy these. Don’t hesitate!!!
"
Scuba Steve,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Comfortable.  Good noise cancellation.  Sound quality is the most disappointing thing about the Air Pods Pro.  For $249, there are MANY alternatives even under $100.  Not the best battery life.,Look at SoundPeats H2.
"
Amanda Dunn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So at first I was a little bit skeptical about buying AirPods through Amazon BUT these are legit and it says visit the apple store near the ratings so that’s another sign it’s legit. I owned a previous pair of AirPod pros and they are the same! So don’t be afraid to order them like I was! Money well spent and they came completely SEALED! Some other people seemed to have some bad experiences but not on my part, definitely buying another pair!
"
K. Heintz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Gave these to my son for Christmas. Came packaged as new. When we linked them they were already named “mom’s AirPods” and the right one would not work. These were sold as NEW and were obviously not and repackaged as new! Very disappointed!!! Requested replacement and I will be looking closely to see if we are sold NEW or used.

  I’ve been using the airpod pro from Apple store and I bought this last Black Friday for my son. But when I tried it, it connects and have all the features like the original airpod pro but the noise canceling showed that it is either fake or refurbished. Transparency and noise canceling sound the same.

"
Dennis Peralta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’ve been wanting the Pros for so long, I finally got them and I’m super happy about it. You need to adjust them in your ears to get the noise cancellation to work and definitely get apple care if I was you, so they can fix it or get you a new pair for free.
"
Seth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Big Bang for a small package!  A+ on sound quality and weight. Other AirPods didn’t fit my ears well at all “always falling out” but these pro’s stay in place pretty well. Wish the battery would last longer, but not bad life for how small these are.
"
Margie Winkelmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The absolute best earbuds I’ve ever owned!  The noise canceling feature is a game changer!  I only wish I had 2 pair!!!  I really like using them for work (I work from home), and the sound is amazing!  Problem is, they only last for 4 hours, a second pair would be ideal!!!  😂
"

  Eu amei o relógio, é lindo e é original! Vem com nota fiscal também.,A bateria não dura muito, eu esperava que durasse mais. Ele dura um dia inteiro, e se vc desligar a noite para o dia seguinte ele vai durar o outro dia inteiro também. Mas se ficar dia e noite ligado, só dá um dia! Acredito que seja, pq ele não desliga a tela, fica sempre acesa.,Mas eu amei o produto e o vendedor, o meu pedido chegou antes do prazo.,Vem com o cabo pra carregar, só não vem com o plug da tomada!,Recomendo!

  Really great tablet. 64 GB storage isn’t great, and the ram isn’t great... but everything else is basically like an iPad Pro. I love it!

"
Chloe Blakeman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I recently bought this for school, and so far I enjoy using it. The apple pen and magic keyboard are also a must, in my opinion!,The only major con is that the magic keyboard doesn't provide much protection for the iPad, so you have to be careful.

Christiana's Kitchen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  when I lost my charging box last year, I purchased an off-brand replacement that was never very reliable. So, when I saw this great deal on a new pair, I jumped at it and have been very happy with my decision.
"
Big Daddy G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A huge upgrade from my wifes older set.  She loves them and uses them for work conference calls, listening to music and drowning out my cpap noise at night.
"
Spanky63 ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Another Great product!!  Sound clear and comfortable.  Only down on it is the battery does not last as long I would prefer.  I would recommend this product.
"
Scott Rowekamp,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are awesome. The noise cancelling toggle, the sound quality, the seamless Bluetooth pairing, everything. But I am returning them because I simply could not get the right air pod to fit. None of the 3 different sizes worked nor did some memory foam tips I bought - the right one kept falling out. I had no problem with fit with the 2nd gen air pods and if Apple ever fixes this problem with a Pro version, I will definitely buy them.
"
Naresh Sharma,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Order twice and returned twice due to defective product. It’s better to buy it from store directly.
"
A. Lund,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods are excellent. Very easy to connect to an iPhone or Mac. Sound quality is superb and also great at noise cancellation. Highly recommended.
"
glen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've been looking at getting these for a while now, I am glad I waited to get the pro's, love the noise cancellation they have, it really blocks out the noise.  I had them on the airplane and it shut it all out.
"
D Fin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are very nice for school and work. The noise canceling works very well, but it also has spatial awareness mode where you can hear everything around you. The price is steep that’s why i can’t give 5 stars but i definitely recommend these!
"
john,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the knock offs and thought kinda “so what”. These. Are the “Real Thing” ! The sound quality is great and the ease of use and connectivity super !
"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got mine air pods Pro but today and the left airpod was giving some Beep sound continuously for every 20seconds. Initial though it was music but later on noticed it’s the sound from my AirPod. and after 20 minutes of usage my Ear was started paining. Without returning I took the AirPods to Apple store and the technician confirmed there is a problem in left AirPod and as it was in warranty Apple replaced the left AirPod.,I don’t suggest to get AirPods from here.
"
Mark Twain,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound is clear and full.  Noise cancelling is amazing and I like that it can be disabled or placed in transparency mode for those times when you need to hear your surroundings.
"
Ken Meyer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Lots of tech goodies. Easy to charge, light to carry, fit well and good sound isolation. Easy communication with iPhone & Apple Watch. Sound was not as good as my Master & Dynamics but better fit.  Sound a little muddy.
"
Tabbie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The price was lower than others a d they are absolutely noise canceling!! The fit is nice.  They shipped fast .Excellent service and quality!!! Highly recommended!!
"
Jenny Mehlman,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these because my regular 1st generation ones fall out of my ears regularly and were running out of battery life. While they definitely fit better, it feels like my ears are always clogged when they are in and yet, everything is still noisy. I have tried every setting.  The only reason I am keeping them is because they don't fall out.  But I am actively searching for another brand bc it is definitely not worth it.
"
Angelo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  opened these up and instantly had problems with it. I had problems connecting it and it would take so long that the screen changed to that (the 1st picture). It kept connecting and disconnecting to my phone saying it was “not your airpods” after i would repeatedly connect them. i spent 2 hours trying to figure out whats wrong with them with countless google searches buh my only result was money wasted on airpods that dont even work now i have no headphones to use
"
rozelle mcneal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love these over my beats as the phone call quality is way better. Battery is good not long lasting as my beats but for work these work wonders.
"
Waldo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great audio quality. Lots of bells and whistles for the Apple users. They fall out of my ears after 10 minutes. I always have to readjust them. I ordered connector pieces so they can stay in my ears. The issue there is I can charge them with the rubber mounts around them. I ordered Beats and they stay in perfectly. I use the AirPods around the house and the Beats when I’m on the move.
"
Kaden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have never in my life had to better earphones. My only problem is that these will randomly pause sometimes (but that might be my fault). The noise cancelation blows my mind every time I turn it on, Siri is super helpful, phone calls are easy and good quality for both parties. Overall, these earphones are phenomenal. Great work Apple.
"
sharong,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The rubber on the ear pieces.  3 sizes so you can find one that fits perfectly.  It’s a big upgrade from my old iPods that hurt most of the time.
"
Aroop Chand,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing product if you are an Apple user. Connects quickly to iPhone and charging is fast as well, for both case and pods. Bought it during Thanksgiving at almost $60 off from amazon while the airpods pro were still being sold at MRP in apple website. Genuine product from amazon. Battery drains pretty fast, so carry the case fully charged with you at all times. Noise cancellation works great as well.

"
Miya,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you’re looking for a pair of headphones for going to the gym or any sort of activity i’d advise not buying these. They are known for consistently falling out, a low max volume, the sound quality is honestly very disappointing. By all means this is not me hating or leaving a nasty comment just to be rude, i just personally think you would be happier if you spent your money on something better. I heard the Gen 3 air pods are super good.
"
Rivits,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  sound is great, noise cancelation is great.  But they didn't include a charger.  you get a USB-C cable but unless your wall outlets are fit for USB-C you're going to have to buy a usbc wall brick.  Seems like a silly choice for them.
"
Dalton Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ive gotten other airpod pros before and didnt know the pair was fake until I got these... serial number was valid at apple, way better sound quality and way better features... I was lowkey scared to buy these bc of some of the reviews, but Ive had these for about a week now and they continue to exceed my expectations... I LOVE these... especially the noise cancellation so i dont have to hear my grandmas stupid birds squealing 24/7 lmaooo
"
Stephanie Ziemann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So far, so good. I’m glad I went with the pros because I have small ears and I can choose the tip that fits best. The regular shaped pods hurt and always fall out.
"
Suzy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing noise cancellation easy to maneuver with calls ending, forward to the next song and they pair perfectly with my Apple Watch 6 series
"
JustMeJip2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It fits perfect, I though I was going to return them, BUT, the sound is excellent and the noise cancellation is in another level, I love it.
"
Carl Mortensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods connect every time. The difference between transparency mode and noise cancellation is dramatic. The original AirPods had lots of problems connecting and sometimes 1 earbud wouldn’t charge. I’ve had no problems with the Pro. They also connect much faster.
"
Victor Melendez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love the convenience and how easy they connect to my Apple devices. Downside is that there are better headphones in the noise cancellation and sound quality. But, overall a great buy.
"
Alissa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought as a girly for my partner. He loves it. They are very comfortable and they have a good quality. I tried them with my iPhone and they definitely make a difference. Recommend!
"
Madcitygirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I opened box, synced w iPhone and music, tucked in my ears, and nearly fell over!!  Sound is awesome, simply awesome.  Worth every penny.
"
Mark V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Like that they are simple to use. Was hoping for a little more options when it comes to sound preferences but overall good sound quality.
"
Richard Anshus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Product was fantastic except for the very annoying clicking noise in the right ear bud. Most of the time it was every few seconds. And at its best, the clicking noise was every few minutes. Returned after several times of trying to see if it would go away. It didn't! After googling on how to get rid of the clicking noise, I unfortunately realized other people had the same problem with their Pro ear buds. Apple needs to fix this before they make more!
"
Renee Vandeford,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Unknow,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was going to buy the new AirPod Pros but, I went ahead and bought this instead. The AirPods squick and get this ringing sound in your ear and is loud. I was using these when my ""friends"" were ""talking"" when I over heard them talking about me, so I recorded it. I left them behind and bought my coffee and left them miles away where they lived. I would recommend these if you want to be able to eavesdrop on someones personal chat.
"
Daniel Pontello,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased this product for my work environment at Amalie Arena. Very loud and need to make calls to communicate during loud noises.  The Noise cancellation is amazing. I've tried several other brands of lower value and am kicking myself for not acquiring these buds sooner.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These things are great, vast improvement from the Airpods (1st gen.) And the Power Beats Pro. The sound is absolutely incredible. Well worth the price, especially at the discounted rate from the retail of approximately $250.
"
jbbloom2003,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When I went to connect my ""new"" AirPods to my phone, it said ""not your AirPods"" and they were already named ""Denise's AirPods"". The box wasn't sealed. This was clearly a returned product the company tried to resell as ""new"".
"
Bonnie Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I resisted the urge to upgrade to the AirPod Pro since they first came out. Now that I finally got a pair, I don't use my regular AirPods at all unless I need to charge the pro pair. The noise canceling function works great for me and they are very comfortable.
"
Chris S. Stacy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great performance as I've come to expect from Apple products.  But I did not expect them to be durable enough to survive a trip through the clothes washer inside the charging case.  I let it dry out for about 12 hours and they simply went back to work with no ill effects.
"
Robert Kernechel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The box I received was dirty and not shrink wrapped, and the case had numerous scratches and other signs of use.  The product was clearly used and returned, a factory second, or a refurbished unit.

Updating rating as a result.

  These are my first noice cancelling headphone and I believe the do a pretty good job. Battery live is good. I only use them occasionally during the day and they went for 5 days without having to recharge.

  It was a amazing purchase. The quality is so amazing my box wasn’t damaged nor my screen. Everything was perfect. No scratches no dents. Was like new. Battery life doesn’t do as well as maybe a different iPad but it is still great.
"
Karen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Battery charger and plug in is totally different.,It’s upsetting My new IPhone and IPad have different chargers and plug ins.,I’m done with every Apple product changing plugs every time. I do like apple it’s easy to use.
"

"
Patrick Hammon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Go ahead and splurge. Other ear buds won’t fit your ears right. These will fit and SIRI works with them while your other brand buds won’t play as nicely if you have iOS.

"
Mario Rubino,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are a definitely a downgrade from the previous model. They don’t fit in your ear as well and they do not have the tap control feature. Stick with gen 2, they’re cheaper and a better product.
"

"
Micaiah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  ordered this product a few weeks back and never regretted since. they fit in my ears comfortably, and they are as amazing as advertised. the sound quality is very neat along with the battery life of the airpods themselves & the airpod case.
"
Kendra Smith,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Y’all I have regular sized ears and these things do not fit right they are so big, uncomfortable, and keep falling out!!! The old AirPods are so much better so just stick with the originals or go for the pros
"
Israel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After about two weeks the left pod started to sound like it was blown, I figured I was simply unlucky and order a replacement. The second time it was worst, after only a week the left airpod started to sound distorted in the exact same way
"
Melissa Hermann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Robert Montes,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The stereo system on this item went out after 3 to 4 days. I could only listen from one ear at a time. I returned it immediately and almost a month later still have not received my refund.
"
Caiden,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They sound great a step up from my gen 1s for sure however the fit is just terrible, considering return as they fall out far too much and I have a job where I move around a lot and need them to stay put, not sure how apple missed the mark so bad with the fit on these none of the sizes of ear tips work and they hardly even feel different.
"
Emarcus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had owned the regular AirPods for some time and found them convenient but annoying mostly because they fall out if you do anything else than sit still. Decided to give these a try and don't understand why I waited so long. You can actually tilt your head sideways without them falling out! Not to mention noise cancelling - works quite well during flights.
"
ivy lopes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It took me a while to get into these. I didn’t think I’d like them but they are the best headphones I’ve owned! I always have an issue with buds staying in my ears and these for perfectly after switching to the smaller size rubber tip.
"
linda alexander,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound quality is great, background noise is cut back greatly. Fit comfortably in ear, soft inserts. The only drawback for me was battery limited to 5 hrs or so. Well worth the investment overall. “ I love 💕 my buds “

   I enjoy the noise cancellation mode more than the transparency mode but good to have both options especially, while walking around the city and crossing roads often. My go to headphone for workout at the gym. You can change the rubber tips to make the pairs best fit for your ear. Apple products are for the quality experience!
"
Tigran Bazarchyan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ordered AirPods 3rd gen for my mom, she have used apple products for quite sometime. She is really happy with the product, hands down top quality for the price. Totally worth it.
"
Yomaira,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had the 2nd airpod generation, but I was looking for a upgrade.  The quality sound is much better than the 2nd gen and I feel these are smaller and more comfortable.  Love the spatial audio feature with head tracking!!
"
Joshua Dill,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They work great and are super comfortable, may not be a good fit for everyone though… I use them everyday and have no complaints so far.
"
D. Sherry,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This may be unique to me but the fit of the 3rd generation AirPods was really uncomfortable after a couple of hours. With my 1st generation pods I could wear them in my ear all day, barely even remembering I had them in.
"

"
Daniel H.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  There wasn't anything very outstanding that differentiates these from similar earbuds for purchase, other than perhaps the brand name and aesthetic. You can find a more feature-rich pair elsewhere, for the same cost.

"

  Airpods pro is definitely better than their previous products, and offers better shape and less weight. The sound quality and battery life could be improved, and especially connectivity needs to be more smart.

"
Thunderbird,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This was actually a replacement purchase for someone. Tho I’ve never had problems, two other family members experienced problems with one bud switching cancellation on and off.  Seems maybe quality control is not as good. Apple however is very good about replacing with a good set if you’re passed the Amazon return date. For me, this has the best fit, sound and noise cancellation. And I like the compactness of the device.

"
kipiib89,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Good battery life and easily syncs to phone.  Getting a feel for controlling ear buds was a bit odd but got used to it.  First time using noise cancelling devices and didn’t cancel as much as expected but nothing to compare to so may be fine.  Ears feel fine even after hours of wearing.

Javier Jalandoni,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Product looks great and sounds great. My only issue is that the AirPods had a name assigned to it when we paired it to our phone. This implies that the product was previously owned, contrary to what is marketed as brand new on your website.

Brenda Piche,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They were very easy to set up. Just opened the case and they paired up with my Bluetooth immediately! The sound is awesome and the fit is very comfortable. I am not disappointed at all.  These are the best set of earphones I have owned, would highly recommend them!
"
Ash Dantas,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sounds and feel of the headphones is good. I had high hopes for it, as I generally have issues with in the ear headphones staying in my ear. Well no such luck, I’ve tried a couple different things and just can’t solve the issue and unfortunately it’s pretty unusable for me.
"
DanaEFox,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Just when you want to dislike Apple for their crummy phones, you remember how great the earpods are....
"
steve lewandoski,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I could not get a good fit in my ears even when trying the different size pads,Returned
"
Glo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Maybe it’s just my experience but they constantly slip out. The first generation fit better than these.
"
Weijie Yao,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have already changed to the smallest size, but it still hurts my ear. It just feels so uncomfortable wearing this thing for more than 30 minutes. I wonder if the designer of this thing has a bigger ear than normal people.,Everything else is good, but if I don't even feel comfortable to wear it, what is the point to have it
"
Holden wimberly,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I loved the gen 2 but save yourself something else these are so bad from fitting in the ear to holding a charge to sound quality and no noise cancelling these are hot ass and apple should do a better job they suck so bad
"

"
Itza Jimenez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The second generation makes my ears hurt. Third generation have a great fit in my ears.
"
Martín Valverde,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Let’s keep it short: these are way to uncomfortable to wear and keep falling off, also, the button to change songs and stuff is now on the leg of the AirPods instead of the body, useless.,They sound good tho.
"
Juan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like the new feature spatial sound but the buttons are not customizable, what I mean by that is the that I can’t make it to be accustomed to my own way of controlling the way I use the music or sound.

"
Travis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is m 5th iPad and the best one by far.  The 4th gen iPad Air is an amazing upgrade. I bought a keyboard with a track pad for it and it is now essentially a laptop that is more portable and versatile.

"
Jo Cuan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the adjustable fit of these headphones. They don’t fall out of your ear like the other AirPods. Noise cancellation is pretty awesome with the transparency option. Everything syncs with your phone…tells you the battery life, reads your text messages to you.  Battery life is better than the original AirPods. What’s not to love about these headphones. I wished I had gotten these Airpod Pros years ago.
"
Lyndon Baker,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love everything about these earbuds except that they become unbearable after an hour of wearing them. It starts with minor discomfort, then turns into pure pain after just a little while. I've always been a fan of the ""earpod"" design so I'm exchanging these for 3rd Gen Airpods to hopefully ease the pain. I'm super bummed that this didn't work out though because the noise cancellation is a great feature.
"
Madison,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought for myself and I love them!! They are so nice and the sounds is great! Came in original packaging and didn’t have any problems with them! The noise canceling of these things is AWESOME!
"
Rene' Edwards,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The picture that is posted with the description is inaccurate. What I was sent was 3gens, and I have been waiting over a week for a refund the status has changed. Waiting to receive the item for a refund. Please don't waste your money I decide to take a chance and it is not worth it. I just bought it at Costco instead.
"

   Meh. These are not new, I’ll tell you that. The product is overall amazing tho. I just wish they were new. The case is slightly lifted up. They sound great and everything works fine.
"
Russ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are wonderful. Very comfortable when paired with the right ear size (3 sizes provided). Versatile too! Noise cancelling or transparency modes offer options for listening in crowds or in noisy environments like ballgames.
"

"

"
DRAK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality isn’t too bad.  I love the noise canceling these buds offer.  They suck for workouts - I’d go with a wrap around option for that.  Mostly just use these for general listening and not a workout.

"
Randi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This product would have been perfect if it weren’t for the slightly larger head phone size in your ear. I have small ears that’s why they didn’t work for me. They are larger than the 2nd gens.

Kasi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I own a pair and got another as a gift. Better in every aspect compared to the basic AirPods, only downside is that the ear piece slips out sometimes within use. Noise cancellation is a must and the 3D audio feature is such a treat.
"
Happy Shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Quality is great. Comfortable in ear. Battery seems to use up quicker than advertised. For the price of this item they should throw in the quick charger and cable. At least it would compensate for battery drain because you can get back to using it quickly
"
Pam Howard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love these AirPods! They automatically pair,  and the sound and noise cancellation work great!
"
Victor Castaneda,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had gotten these for a Christmas present thinking that they're new and sealed, but when I opened the Amazon packaging, the AirPods box was all opened. When I checked the contents inside, everything was all dusty/dirty, cable was all unraveled & the tips had lint and gunk inside of them. You can see all the dirt inside the AirPods box as well. These are used!
"

"
Jorge Quiros,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They randomly unpaired overnight and I can’t seem to have them pair up even reading up on how to do it from apple. What a waste, not what I expected from high end or nice earbuds and this was the second pair as my first pair battery degraded horribly over 6 months. Thanks apple.

"

  I don’t like my fit in the ear without the inserts
"
Entela Hoxha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Def worth if you’re going from airpods but i don’t think it’s worth if you are trying to upgrade from pros since they don’t have noise cancellation. If you don’t like the silicone on the pros they’re 100% worth it.
"
Elina,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality is awful. Noise cancellation 0.,Also, plus to everything else, the right one has a noise in it which is very furstrating. I wish I can return them.

"
Jacob Buckles,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Airpod G1 and G2 fit great. However, the G3 falls well short in terms of fit. They constantly feel like they're going to fall out.

"
SoCalMike,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received my iPad Air 4 today and I am very disappointed. It is replacing an iPad Air 2 that I had for many years. The number one complaint I have is the lack of a home button. Even if it was a virtual home button, that would be a huge improvement. Going from App to App is absolutely horrible. Android’s interface is definitely superior in this way. I know there are Apple homers that will disagree with me, but I am telling you, it is frustrating as heck not to have a home button. I would not buy this without Apple addressing this horrible usability issue.

  For me, airpods hurt ears after a while.. maybe 45 minutes. They don’t fall out easily, and the battery is very nice. Another thing to mention is, that the case is really small.
"

"
Naveen S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The pods are not well finished, I can feel the cut at the joint in both the airpods. I expect it to be perfect when you pay almost $200. Also, in the Product information-->Technical Details-->Country of Origin says China, you have sent me Made in Vietnam. These are the replacement airpods, same poor quality for the previous ones as well.  Not happy at all.
"

"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My son ordered a pair. Sound awesome. Wanted a pair for myself. Unable to order. First Amazon rep said he lifted the purchase limit for me. Still unable to purchase. Called Amazon. Second rep told me I would be able to purchase after 7 days of first order. Still no go. Highly disappointed in everything Amazon right now.
"
Jon Hartmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Not sure if they changed the process but the newest version (with MagSafe) of Airpod Pro made in Vietnam is much better, the finish is great and quality is very reliable. My older AirPods ones that are made in China lost Bluetooth connection on one ear after merely 5 months

"
Mike V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Added bonus from these air pods. I used them the other day as purely a noise cancellation device while I was taking my daily hike. They completely blocked out the human [roar} while letting in the insect and bird noises. If you don't mind these pods in your ears while hiking I think you'll be happy with them for this purpose also.

  Will be returning. Super nice sound quality but they don’t fit in my ears. The design is too big. Wouldn’t recommend for small ears.
"
JFreem19,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very troubling as this was a Christmas gift. The box arrived unsealed which I thought was peculiar. When my husband went to pair them with his phone they had already been paired with someone else’s account. They are definitely not new, and possibly counterfeit. We returned and purchased straight from Apple and will continue to do so in the future.
"
Freddy Zuniga,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Although there  are other wireless headphones, the AirPods works like magic with your Apple devices. Now, if you’re looking for something to entirely block surrounding noises then this is not the best option, the noise cancellation works well but is not best in class.
"
JeannetteB,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I liked the ease of setup with my other Apple devices. I was able to use them right away and try all of the features.
"

"
Isaac,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you like your head phones falling into the ground and your Bluetooth being disconnected 5-10x’s throughout the day or during a single workout these are for you. The OLD apple head phones are a lot better and never fall out.,If you are looking for noise canceling, these are great but drain the battery quickly.
"
Steve Kovacevich,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love the noise cancellation- a feature that allows me to focus on work.  The sound quality is 4 out of 5.  They do not stay put in my ears though.  If my head tilts to the side one always falls out.  I turn them upside down and switch ears and they stay in a little better BUT I lose some button functions.
"
Brittney Ann Little,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I thought they might stay in better than the regular ear buds. I was wrong. Because they didn’t suction well, the noise cancellation didn’t work.
"
xanthe,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m so bummed that I had to return these as wearing them with the ANC on gave me vertigo which I’ve never experienced before. Both the noise cancellation and sound quality are amazing. Sadly, I guess I have sensitive ears so the ANC mode messed up my ears.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  great sound and quality! love the choices between noise transparency and noise canceling. The choices between the silicone tips are so cool, if it doesn’t fit your ear you can choose a different tip for it!
"

"
Brandon Mitchel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  airpods themselves work fine...but the charging case doesnt.  Never had a problem with Apple products this early in ownership when bought directly from Apple, so I am very much of the belief that the lower-than-market price is because of it being a scam/knock-off supplier.
"
Fernande Peral,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had to take these AirPods to a technical service. Left  EarPod wasn’t working well when Noise cancellation is activated.
"
Tee,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality is really good and the noise cancellation is paramount but they keep falling out of my ears. I got these specifically because of the smaller tips but they still are too big for my poor tiny ears.😩

  Bought these for my husband for Christmas. And they were used. There was earwax, hair, and when we tried to connect it it said connect to abe’s AirPods. Super embarrassing considering this was a Christmas gift. And I’m over here giving someone used AirPods. They were re sealed too. All I Gotta say is Abe needs Q tips

  I’m an original Airpod user and love the product. Used it for over 4 years before. Got this new pro and a week later the left Airpod doesn’t work anymore. Cant charge it can’t connect it. I reset the device to try to fix it and now neither Airpod connects to my phone. This is crazy on a factory new device. Returning it immediately

Marc Elali,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I honestly expected more. I don’t like the feel and how it sits in the ear. I am constantly adjusting it. I changed the tips in order to resolve that issue. But it’s still not the best feel. Battery life isn’t impressive. Sound quality is awesome. Noise cancellation is perfect.

  I've been waiting a year for version 3 to come out. I preordered these and they came in the day of release. I was super excited. THEY SUCK. They constantly fall out of my ears, they feel much bigger than the old air pods and hurt my ears. They controls are way harder to use(if they work) than the old way you just double tap to pause.,Buy the version 2 not 3 it isn't worth it.,I've submitted them for a refund through apple and as soon as they refund the money I'm going to buy version 2 again.  What gives Apple?
"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Heads up! These may be too big to fit properly in your ears. Terrible new design. Feels like they are going to fall out all the time. The original design style was perfect.
"
buyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My first impression when I bought these was ""No way!"". They looked too big compared to my 2nd gen Airpods .. I bought them from a retailer that has a 6 months return policy so I decided to give them a chance.,The airpods felt large in my ears and my ears started hurting after about an hour. I used to keep my 2nd generation in my ears all day and I never had any issues. I continued to give them a chance and I can say that my ears adapted to them pretty quickly. It is one of those situations where you start using a new muscle. It may hurt at first then you get used to it. After a few days, they feel 95% as comfortable as the Airpods 2nd gen. I used to carry both and now I haven't used the 2nd gen for about a week..,Aside from the size, the sound quality is night and day difference from Gen 2. You can actually enjoy music with them. They do have bass which is non existent on the Gen2.,The battery life is super good. I charge them in the morning and I can go until 2pm. I used to have to charge the gen2 at 11am.,My advice, is give them a chance and give your ears some time to adjust. There are a lot of users that ended up returning them and you can tell they are getting discounted fairly aggressively for an apple product. If you can get them to feel comfortable, they are a huge leap from the gen 2.
"
Mac'n,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered these directly from Apple and will be returning. The spacial audio features and connectivity are amazing, especially compared to previous generations. While Gen 1/2 fit my ears perfectly, these fall out of my ears after about 5 minutes of light movement. Even a simple yawn is enough to dislodge them for me. I understand the first 2 gens only fit 70% of ears (or something close to that) but now it seems like they created an issue for a different 30% of users.,Happy for those of you who can now finally wear these, but Apple should be ashamed and should have made multiple models. Now I’m sure they’ll just try to funnel us to the pro version.
"
Nick Vinson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you were a fan of the Airpods 2, these are definitely not an upgrade. They do not fit, they are basically the airpods pro without silicone tips. Returning promptly.
"
J. Bevan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  OK, I'm not listed as a ""verified purchaser"" because I received these as a gift, but I do have them in my possession...even in my ears as I write this.  First, I think the sound is better (listen mostly to classical music) than the 2nd generation (which recently succumbed to getting water on one of them).  BUT I find them ""fatter"" than the 2nd Generation and they simply don't fit in my ears as well and the right one just fell out...sitting still (no aerobics).  So that is a concern.  So far the ""spatial audio"" hasn't made much difference to me.  I was in love with the 2nd generation before their unschedule/planned baptism.  These sound wonderful...but I don't want to superglue them into my ear !!
"
Mark,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've used Bose Noise Canceling and other AirPods Noise cancelling AirPods - couldn't handle them. Stuffed up my ears after just a few minutes and took days to unstuffy them.  These seem to be different. Perhaps because no active noise cancellation and they sit in the ears rather than being stuffed into them with a tight seal.  Have just had them for a few days, but like them. Sit very steady in my ears and don't feel like they will come out at all.  Ears a bit sore after taking them out but I think that is getting used to them a bit. Will see how that goes. Like how easily they pair with a device (iPad, Apple TV, iMac) as you switch devices.  It would have been nice to have a volume up/down on it vs having to control that by the phone, tv,etc.  When using for telephone use, the other party said they sounded fine and I could hear them fine.  Definitely no noise cancellation - outside noises are all there (which is a safe thing in a way), but on a plane, train - would not be good - you would need the Pro's for that.  Have watched a few Dolby Atmos tests on YouTube- very impressive.
"
John H.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are an improvement in every way over the AP2, which includes better sound (spatial audio makes a huge difference), battery life, shorter stem, water resistance, and shorter stems. But the one huge area, and the reason that I decided to return them, is that they do not fit my ears. I could leave the AP1 and AP2 in my ears all day and I would essentially forget that they were there. But these new Airpods do not feel as comfortable, the head that sits in your ear is much larger, which probably helps with the sound but they do not stay put in my ears. They never fall out but they shift and are not comfortable after about 30-45 minutes.,If Apple would have made the same head profile as the AP2, with shorter stems, these would have been perfect for me, but as they stand, I cannot endorse them, at least for my particular ear shape.
"
MonicaDS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really hoped I liked these because I wanted some that didn't set in my hear canal due to discomfort. I had beats but my ear canal still hurts and they were uncomfortable around the ear. With a mask on and these you are too likely to lose them.  Compared to Gen 2 these just don't set safely in my ear. I find them slipping the first time I tried them. I want all the features of these but they are a bigger fit than Gen 2 or actually even the Pro.  We were able to compare them since each of my daughters have the other versions. This by far are fat and loose, so not as trustworthy that you won't lose them. Especially during this winter and with mask around the ear, they could easy fall or get caught up in your scarf and you won't know it until it's too late.  True any can fall but unless you have deep ears these are just too easy. Nope too expensive to lose like that so I got rid of them. I can only hope Apple make some that have these features but actually rest in your ear like Gen 2. I'm sure not likely but one can hope.
"
Jeff Hathaway,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm not sure how it happened, but I find myself...at age 60+ an avid ""Apple FanBoy"". It's become an almost crazy obsession to keep buying the latest and greatest Apple products. These Apple Airpods 3 are another example since I had the 1st generation and the 2nd generation AirPods. While the first and second were okay (not great...just okay), this 3rd generation is getting closer & closer to perfection.,Pros: 1) shorter stem,  2) improved bass,  3) spatial audio,  4) longer battery charge,  5) solid bluetooth connectivity,Cons: 1) lack of noise cancellation,  2) open back design,  3) stem pinch controls,Admittedly, when I'm in-the-mood for serious music appreciation (listening), my headphones of choice are still the Apple AirPods MAX around-the-ear cans with noise cancellation.
"
Alexandre,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Lets say, you're shopping for Chevy... and Caddy comes your way! You get more than you bargain for! I hope you can catch my drift!,Update: few weeks later…,I’m very happy with these AirPods. Very happy and fully satisfied! They’ve kinda grown up on me. They are NOT suitable for jogging. Not for me. Their new design (without silicon tips now) is lacking somewhat secure, carefree feeling, that you may lose one/both of them while running. It’s just my opinion. Other than that - they’re SUPERB in every aspect! Sound quality… They come with Apple Music 6 months free subscription. And, when you turn spatial audio on… OMG! You’ll see the difference, for sure! One of the best features is they’re fully operated by Siri. Volume up/down, next/previous song, etc. So convenient, I must say! Battery life - more you’ll ever need, trust me.

  I was a skeptic of this noise cancelling technology via ear pods at first. The bass is crystal clear and I can hear finer details, the way the artist meant this to be heard. Truly amazing sound experience.

  Some nice features but sound quality was better with my 4 year old $20 plug-in earpods.  The bass on these doesn't exist no matter what adjustments I made.  Apparently mine are authentic (per the SN) and manufactured in 2021.  Not worth the price.

  It sucks because I really loved my first generation airpods and I was super excited to get the airpod pros! but the battery life on the ones i received are horrible! It’s mainly the case that does not hold its charge and I feel like my old airpods held a charge a lot longer than these very sad!

"
SpeedMasterPro,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Have all the apple air pods. This sounds just as good as the pro's without the noise cancelling. I really like them. However, when music or video is paused, the right earbud starts making a high pitched hissing coil whine sound. I've tested 3 separate new pairs and all of them had the problem. I even had one shipped back to apple for repair but the same problem persisted upon its arrival. Great product but there may have been a manufacturing defect on the first batches from the factory.
"
Elliott S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Returned these for a new pair of AirPods 2. These have WAY too much bass and low end. It muddies up all my tracks! It sounds like they let the high schooler with a modified ‘99 Honda Civic thumping bass loud enough to set car alarms off do the EQ on these. Not everyone enjoys loud bass. It sounds like crap to me. And I refuse to use EQ on all my music to accommodate the bad sound mix of these.,They also sit in the case awkwardly. Are a little larger fit and don’t feel secure in your ear, and oddly sized case. I do like the shorter stems but not much else to justify keeping these. The controls on the stems are hard to use without knocking them out.,Poorly designed generation. AirPods 2 are superior!
"
Sam S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really wanted to love these. I've had AirPod 1's for ages and when they recently died, I decided to get these because I prefer the open feel over the enclosed feel of the AirPod Pro's. The 1's fit my ears fine, however the 3's simply don't. Everything about their functionality is superb and I love the sound or them. But... just simply keep falling out of my ears, and I'm a little disappointed.,So no, these aren't a one-size-fits-all product, and I don't even have large ear canals or anything - I'm as ordinary as it comes. I recommend trying them on before buying.
"
HaloFan9,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great features and sound, but Airpods 3 are too big to fit in-ears (especially the right side).  I have no issues with Airpods 1/2 and Airpods Pro.  They made the Airpods 3 too big so I returned them to Apple.
"
Andrew,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Enjoy high audio quality with long battery life in a sleek form factor sure to grab peoples attention to the fact that you have/had money? Has your recent Botox job left you with a face reminiscent of the Mona Lisa? Suffered a stroke leaving you with an inability to show complex emotion? Got a heavy case of RBF? These headphones are for you!,Bottom line: as long as you don’t chew, smile, turn your head too fast, or inquisitively at an angle- they might stay in your ears. Or you can always spend more money on peripheral attachments which might help them stay in your ears but also renders the sleek styling and convenience of the charging case moot!
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really wish Apple would make these for smaller ears. I put one in my ear, moved it about 10 different ways and it just kept falling out. I have the Pros, (they stay in but are also a little large) but I didn’t love the squishy tip. After reading reviews I thought these would do the trick. They just aren’t for smaller ears. If you have lots of room for the Airpod Pros, these are for you. My ears worked way better with the OG design. We’re all different, thus the 3 star review. If you have ears that fit, they are amazing. Smaller ears, stay away.
"
tyler hogan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Buy these headphones. They suck at staying in your ear (hence why mine fell in a river and then down a waterfall), but just buy whatever you have to so they stay in your ear; it will be worth it.,I grabbed it and had no doubt in my mind that it was definitely dead, so I just left it in the mesh pocket of my backpack. After 5-10 minutes, I guess something on my backpack leaned on the clicker and paused the song, so my left headphone went dead. I then took the now dry headphone and put it in my ear and the song resumed playing as if nothing happened.,In my own opinion of what can go wrong tech-wise to destroy something, just about every one of those happened to that headphone and it took ten minutes to dry and sounds good as new.,Durability is off the charts.
"
Luckygirl ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Overall, the sound is great with a lil base that makes  listening to music soothing and cool. Battery life could be better for the price, and since this suppose to be an upgrade from the previous air pods the battery seems no better than the last generation to me. Also, the main thing that makes it not so great for me is the pods makes my ear hurt and they become sore after only a short while of using them. I can bare with the battery life, but just not this, issue. I’m not sure if my ears are just small or what. I think my ears are normal size to me. However, after about a good 30 mins or so my ears are sore, and I’m forced to take them out. Because of this, I only wear one air pod in my ear at a time because once one ear gets sore, I take that air pod out of that ear and then insert the other air pod in my other ear. I keep rotating just to make it through, which I shouldn’t have to do for the price because I paid around $179 without tax at my local Target store. I started to get the next generation up that looks basically the same as this air pod, but have a soft piece to cover the air pod which u can switch out according to your ear size. That might have been better for me. Good luck, especially if you have small ears.
"
Noneedforaname,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sounded great at first but I quickly noticed they fit only very very loosely in ear. Feels like you need to constantly adjust them or they will fall out. Works well only if you are sitting absolutely still and not doing anything vigorous at all. They fit so loosely that if one falls out you don’t even notice it until it’s too late and gone forever. I cannot recommend these at all the fit is so horrible. Go with either the Pro or another product altogether. Swing and a miss Apple.
"
Joshua Eddings,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have always loved apple ear buds. From the OG circle buds, to the new gen egg shape. Ive used the Gen2 airpods for 2+ years and love them. Decided to upgrade to Gen3. I have in ear psoriasis so rubber tips are painful for me so i was pumped for an upgrade.,So the speakers/mic are both obviously better. Lightyears better than Gen2? No, probably not event noticeably so, but better nonetheless. Spatial audio is pretty cool, Magsafe charging is always nice. And just light upgrades all around.,Gen3 are clearly larger and will probably fit a little too tight in most cases. The shape is weird, they just chopped off the rubber tips from the pros and called it a day, but without them you dont have the same anchor point. So with normal/smaller ear canals it wont feel as secure.,IMO If the Gen2 fit comfortably in your ears then I would stick with them. I dont think there is enough here to be worth the $60 price difference.

  My Humble Thoughts,When I Bought my 1st apple product a year ago airpods gen 2 I could not believe how good they sounded (to me at least),Now the Airpods gen 3 are out and I just can't believe how much better they sound than my gen 2 airpods .,I've went back and fourth with my Listening tests between the gen 2 and gen 3 and I have to admit (for me at least) The Hype Is Real .,The Bass Is Even More Punchy Than The Gen 2 Was And The Gen 3 Seems Louder As Well Without Adjusting The Volume During My Listening Tests .,Every time I listen to music video podcast you name it (for me) is just shear Listening joy . Thanks For Reading My Review
"
Falcon Cosby,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received these for Xmas and was so excited however they changd the shape of the ear Pod. I am an average size woman. Before you buy I highly suggest you try them on and see if they fit in your ear comfortably. I feel like they are going to fall out and are definitely not snug fitting. My husband has the older generation and they fit much better so I guess he gets a new pair and I get his old pair.
"
Benjammin',2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If you've found the fit of AP2 to be comfortable and secure then chances are you won't like the fit of these in your ear. AP2 feels secure in my ears whether it's walking, at the gym or mountain biking. AP3 feels like it's hanging on by a thread and while they were OK for walking around I wouldn't trust them beyond that. Even the APP fit way better for me.,I don't own these as I returned them because they did not fit nearly as well as the AP2 do.
"
Jared Denman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Bought these directly from Apple. They are hands down the worst product I have owned from Apple. They are huge (by design) compared to my 2nd gen. I thought this would be a pro, but boy was I wrong. They constantly fall out and the comfort level is horrendous. They kill my ears after 10 min of use. I’ve now had these almost for a full 2 weeks. Returning now. Don’t recommend unless you have some huge shrek ears!
"
Alex Dell'Oliver,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These have a way harder time connecting than their predecessors, and often just refuse to connect if there are other Bluetooth speakers nearby. The new shape hurts my left ear after about 20-30 minutes and the pain just gets worse if I don’t take them out. They take way longer to charge (although to be fair the charge lasts a long time), and when I take one out to pause what I’m listening to the sound stops, then if I set it down on a hard surface it starts right back up again in my remaining ear. I loved the older models and would give up the sound quality in a second to not have these other issues.
"
kayden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  i would definitely recommend these airpods to people that have a decent ear size but definitely not for small ears. the battery life is amazing i had them in the charger for about 10 minutes and they were at 80 when i popped them out the case! when you first put them in it will hurt but thats because your ears aren’t used to them yet. give it a day or two and you’ll be just fine. if you’re looking to get airpods i’d recommend the pros just because they have noise cancellation.
"
Jong Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  When Apple used to bundle devices with EarPods, I realized the fit was terrible. So I avoided the AirPods and only used the AirPod Pros (with the in-ear silicone tips). But the fit on these are different - I heard it was bigger and fit my ears much better. So these work well for me during the daytime. Do note that these don't well for me when lying down.
"
Buu,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sound is great on these and visually with the shorter stem they look good.  The issue is the controls on the AirPods themselves, with the 2nd gen you can skip tracks by double tapping on the outside of the AirPod so it stays in your ear, but with these (and the Pro) you have to hold the bottom of the stem in a certain indented spot to skip tracks.  This is an issue as the AirPods fall out each time I touch them.  My work out gloves get in the way as well, I hated it and will be returning.  If you don’t use your AirPods in this way (I.e use your Apple Watch to control music) then these are great but if you use this functionality like I do at the gym, on planes, etc. you will not enjoy this experience.  I wish they had the double tap as well on the back of the AirPods and then I would love these….
"
Daniel,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm not sure why Apple messed with the original fit, as the third-generation are really bad. They hurt in the ear, the stems are too short to use while working out, and they're just plain uncomfortable. I've had to replace my AirPods quite frequently due to the battery drain, and if this is the future of AirPods, I've probably bought my final pair.
"
Fletcher Sheridan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After having the second generation and loving them it was time to “upgrade”. That was a a mistake. I have big ears for one. and these were too big to find comfort while wearing. They came loose and fell out during normal house chores. Nice sound quality. That’s it.  Having to push a physical button to pause and fast forward sucks when you’re hands are dirty. I will be returning these and buying another pair of 2nd gen pods. I love apple, I hated these.

  After a few days' usage. I came to a conclusion that they do not fit my ears. They are too big and bulky. My ear do not hurt BUT they feel bad in my ears.

"
Red,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I couldn’t compare them to the older models since I haven’t had any other models but in my opinion they work fine the audio quality is great only bad this is that they do fall often, I keep having to keep pushing them in my ear because it’s hard to get them to stay but besides that they work great. The batter life lasts more than the whole day highly recommend.
"
Will Martin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These airpods are great in terms of sound quality and battery life. However I wouldn't recommend them to people with smaller ears. These are entirely too big, and if your ears are slightly smaller than average, like mine, they may start to hurt in your ears after a while. And my friend, who's ears are even smaller than mine, just couldn't even put them in his ears. Also there's just no reason to get these right now. The pros are the same price, same sound quality, NC and Transparency, fits more ears, and now they come with magsafe. Save your money, or get the pros.
"
Maulik M,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't know why they had to change the size of the head after very successful predecessor.,Airpods 2 were great fit for me and I could go through many hours without noticing it's there in my ear.,Airpods 3 I start feeling the pain after 30mins, because of bigger size of the head.
"
Cynthia Herrera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  unfortunately they were a gift to me from my brother so i do not have the heart to give them back. but hopefully i save you from spending money on shiny things rather than quality. the buds are HUGE and do not fit well, they kept disconnecting from my iphone (XR) so might not be a good choice if you have an older iphone. the fit feels so horrible i think the design to be a compromise between head phones and earbuds where it does not go into your ear but it's not big and chunky. unfortunately it was not a good compromise so uncomfortable.,stick with the airpods 2 or go for the pros.
"
Rak1212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After using Airpod 2, Airpod pro and Airpod max, I was amazing surprised as soon as I tried it first time. I have little different size ear canal and Airpod 2 And Pro were little challenge to keep in one ear. This pods sits and fits perfectly in my earlobes. But the sound quality is out of this world. Never thought of such a rich and powerful sound from featherweight pods. It will be music to your ear watching movies and shows on apple tv with spatial sound. It is Not noise canceling but have max for that. I think apple hit a perfect balance of power and performance with Airpod 3
"
J Murdock,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I’m not sure why they made these things so huge, but they definitely don’t want to stay in my ears. I got these for Christmas as a gift and took them on a run today for the first time and I was repeatedly having to push them back in. The left one actually fell out during the run and hit the pavement. Very poor design.
"

  I am a fan of Apple devices for their ease of use. But for the first time I loved AirPods Pro for how robust they’re built. I left them in my tracks by mistake and put into laundry.

Just buy them directly from Apple, this was not worth the hassle.

  I just upgraded to these during the christmas holiday from the gen 1 airpods from 3 years ago. i am not a fan of the foam tips so i went for these without. if you dont have large ears do not get these!!! as someone with small ears these will NOT stay in my ears at all, many times i am listening and they disconnect due to them slowing falling out. sound quality is great but it is hard to enjoy when they keep falling out.
"
Gavin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don’t personally own these ones but I do own a pair of air-pod pros, with a lot of people saying these ones hurt your ears if you have them in for to long, but with air-pod pros if they start to hurt your ears try sizing the tip down and see if it helps. I would recommend air-pod pros over AirPods 3 generation because comfort  is the most important thing with these type of things.
"
Rachel Davis,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My 1st gen air pod battery life has been suffering so I decided to upgrade. This are bigger and fall out of my ears. The gen 1 and gen 2 fit perfectly so I wish I had just updated to gen 2. Also, there is no tap feature. You have to squeeze a button. This will help loosen them to keep falling out. Overall a frustrating purchase.

  Seems like the fit is a complaint, but I find that these fit better than the first gen ones for me. I guess the fit can be hit or miss.,What's great though is that the bass is excellent, sound quality is great, and battery life is FAR better than the earlier generations. I find the lack of the ""bud"" makes these far more comfortable than the Pro as well.

  I was waiting for this gen for a very long time. Basically, it is a Airpords pro without pro - noise cancellation feature. I have to say I am a bit disappointed because I thought Apple would bring in some level of noise cancellation without tips like what Huawei does. After seeing this, I'd still keep my pro ones for majority of my applications where I need noise cancellation.

  Average sound quality at best.  There are many less expensive headphones that produce this same sound quality.  After about 2 months of one of these stopped charging properly and would not play when connected to my iMac.  The only reason I give it 2 stars instead on 1 is because they do work well with other apple products like Apple TV and iPhone.  I would not buy these again and will probably never buy apple headphones again.

  For someone who struggled for months to find earbuds that are 1.comfortable 2.affordable 3.battery life that supports my lifestyle, I’m happy to say these surpass all my expectations. They sound wonderful. Sound like im sitting in a movie theatre. I have smaller ears and they are not only comfortable but they stay in place, really. If you’re considering these, pull the trigger. Definitely worth the money. 10/10

  As with any Apple product, these sync'd beautifully with multiple phones/computers.  The sound quality is above average compared to other earbuds, but (as should be expected) will not compete with over the ear headphones.  There is no active noise canceling feature, but they do a fairly good job of blocking out background noise.  The ""Hey Siri"" function, auto pause on removal from your ear, and notification support all work very well.  Others have validated for me that the microphones do a good job of picking up your voice, so you can feel confident using these on calls.,My only gripes are the size and accessories.  These are slightly larger than the Apple wired headphones (and gen 2 Airpods from what I've read) and that can cause some discomfort when wearing for long periods.  I'd recommend twisting them slightly towards your mouth, which seems to help, but that will likely vary by ear!  In typical Apple fashion, a USB-C to Lightning cord is supplied, but no accompanying brick.  So unless you already have a brick, you'll need to use an old cord for charging.  Not a huge deal, but annoying nonetheless.,Overall, I'd highly recommend these!

alex 3D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These earbuds fit me comfortably well, luckily. They felt super lightweight being sweat resistant, snow resistant, and rain resistant, as long as myself not being soaking wet. They were made small enough to be touched and controlled with ease by my slim fingers.,Except without having noise cancellation mode, except being one size fit all, and except came with a smaller wireless charging case, these pretty much the same things like the pro which has been used frequently by me on daily basic more than a year. I liked my pro best, and I was happy to use these new 3rd gen for different occasions too.,I have used these new gen for WFH in quiet environment, and their battery life and sound quality being as awesome as the pro. Whenever on the go, I would only use the pro because of their having both of noise cancellation and transparency modes.,If i would have to drop any star for any particular reasons, then I would criticize these new gen for not having noise cancellation mode. Well, to be fair, these new gen have got nothing wrong without the noise cancellation mode. They way cheaper than the pro … right, pricing would be the next thing to be reviewed.,For pricing of these new gen, I could be able to purchase 3 ~ 4 different good brands of android Bluetooth earbuds which ranged between $40 - $60. See? Pricing would be the top issue for many reviews … you might not like something simply because of their high price.,For me, I did purchase at least 4 different “great” android Bluetooth earbuds in the past, just for my different android devices such Fire tablets, android laptop, and android smart tvs. Why did I buy 4 instead of 1, so stupid right? I know what you mean. Right, those great android earbuds really being so cheap and so stupid as the same time. Once the android earbuds got connected with my fire tablet’s Bluetooth for example, I must disconnect its most recently connected fire tablet before I could connect it with another Bluetooth device of mine such as the laptop, every single time to repeat these stupid routines … so sick of repeating the same steps every single time ... so I had ended up buying 4 different brands of Bluetooth earbuds for each of my 4 different android devices, so that I didn’t have to repeat the stupid disconnecting and re-connecting steps every single time. The total of those 4 cheap “great” android Bluetooth earbuds got even cheaper than one AirPods Pro, but …,Unlike the stupid routines mentioned above, these AirPods can be automatically recognized and connected to any of my iPhone, iPad mini, iPad Pro, MacBook just with one touch on the screen whenever I wanted. Apple remembered its setting once for all without having a need for me to know how they did it by themselves. Simplicity, I liked best.,Liked it or not, these are not cheap, and these are way too expensive if you compare its price with any of the “best” android Bluetooth earbuds out there in the market. Just be honest with yourself for one simple question … why do you need these, or do you really need to buy them?

IA,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sick and tired of the way Apple FORCES AirPods to connect to ALL your Apple devices, and if you attempt to remove them from one device, Apple warns you it will remove it from ALL your devices. If you do that, it will just he added back to ALL your devices once you pair them with your phone again.,I swear Apple employees don't eat their own dogfood. What an entirely stupid behavior. And how unbelievably arrogant to not give the customer the choice in which devices are paired.,So you put them in your ears, and you hear the connection chime, play something on your phone, and nothing comes out of the AirPods, because they connected to your CLOSED MacBook. A CLOSED, SLEEPING computer. What in the ACTUAL!! This is beyond stupid. Apple has truly lost the plot under Tim Cook. They sure make money, but they couldn't write decent software if their lives depended on it.

  Got them for $115 at costco. Bought them for my son as well for Christmas. These are better than the gen 2s and have better noise cancellation without them hurting your ears like the AirPod pros. Worth it if you can find them on sale! Air pod pro cases do NOT fit!
"
Diane Bomberg,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality of these wildly overpriced headphones is about on par with the set that came for free with my iPod shuffle 12 years ago, minus the wires. The microphone is pretty bad too, and I usually have to just take them off and hold my phone to my ear for people to understand me.,Eventually the microphone stopped working entirely after around 10 months and I tried to take them in to be fixed under warranty. The “genius” that helped immediately decided that there was water damage due to some nonexistent corrosion on the metal grating over the speaker holes (despite these not being remotely near the microphone section) and helpfully suggested that I buy a new pair for retail price, with the extra charge for Apple Care  of course! Since the headphones have never been wet before I asked a few clarifying questions and was told that maybe they got some sweat in them. Honestly it’s possible since I run in them, but I was hoping that was somehow accounted for in design.,So to sum it up, these headphones are not good for listening to music, not good for talking on the phone, not designed to be worn while working out, and not covered by any meaningful warranty. On top of that they are some of the more expensive wireless headphones on the market. If you’re at all on the fence about AirPods, I’d recommend going with one of the many competent competitors and avoid awarding this poor design and predatory business practice with your hard earned cash.

  Third time buying used/open box headphones and serial number on charging case, which is claimed for warranty purposes, don’t match to any of the AirPods, when you go to find my app, AirPods gives you an error as mismatched and confirmed by apple that they won’t claim warranty on such scenario.,Otherwise, you can connect to your apple device and they will play no problem.

  These are some of the clearest best sounding headphones I’ve ever owned. Coming from the AirPods gen 1, these are in a different league entirely. They fill your ear better for less external noise.

  Loved the Gen 2 AirPods. Bought the gen 3 as an upgrade when the battery on my 3year old gen 2 started to fail (so I needed a replacement).,These gen 3 AirPods wouldn’t stay in my ears while doing workouts in the gym. They would slip out of my ear when I stand up after doing bench press or push-ups.,So I returned them for the more expensive pro model. Oh well.

  BUYER BEWARE: Make sure the product package your AirPods sit in is factory sealed. If not, you got scammed. It seems some somewhere along the distribution path (probably at Amazon’s warehouse) are swapping out the new AirPods intended for you with used ones. Multiple customers have experienced this including myself. These were a gift and when the recipient tried to pair them with his phone it said they were already associated with someone else’s Apple ID (and the start date for the warranty had begun two months prior).

Josh B.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Compared to the AirPods pro, these only lack transparency mode and active noise cancellation - with the trade off being an extra 1.5 hours of listening time on a full charge, and an extra 6 hours stored in the case.,Compared to the previous AirPods 2, these have the following improvements: Spatial audio, adaptive EQ, sweat + water resistance, MagSafe charging.,The problem is the shape - they don't really go in your ear as much as they just rest on the cartilage. At even a casual walking pace it felt like they were going to fall out at any moment.,Will be returning these before they fall out and get lost.
"
Ryan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I purchased these ones due to my dog crunching my one airpod 2nd gen. Sine apple charges about 150 for just one airpod, I though, to hell with it I will upgrade.,2 days in I am returning them as they are worse quality. The sound quality (other than when watching phub) is way worse! I use these to workout and they fall out of my ears and also hurt my ears ifI smile with them on.,Apple has done a worse job with their 3rd Gen airpods and I will never purchase again.
"
Gustavo Curiel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Excelente calidad de sonido, personalmente me gusta mucho el diseño. Hay mejores audífonos probablemente, mas baratos definitivamente, pero lo que me convence de Apple ademas de su diseño e innovación, son las comodidades que presenta manejar un ecosistema Apple, gracias a su chip H1.,El único inconveniente que veo es el precio. $4,500 me parece un buen precio para el AirPods PRO, que la única diferencia con estos es la cancelación de sonido. Tengo que confesar que no leí bien la publicación y pensé que había comprado los PRO por muy buen precio, un poco mi decepción al darme cuenta de mi error, pero no pienso pagar 1,500 mas por el cancelamiento de sonido. De ahí en mas, muy feliz con mi compra
"
John,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Doesn’t fit like like AP2 or APP. A step down in comfort so the sound being better is nothing.,It’s quite clear based on the reviews that everyone has their own opinion on the fit. That’s a clear sign to test the fit yourself. Online it looks like an even 50/50 on comfort- I’m speaking on my experience which is that the AP2 is the best fit to date, APP in second (silicone tips are annoying), and the AP3 are the worst. They’re not only too large, but they also feel loose In your ear and will fall out simply from smiling… crazy these are the real design.
"
Darcy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The previous gen AirPods and EarPods would easily fall out of my ears, but after reading some reviews about the redesigned shape of the 3’s, which apple did to fit more ears, I decided to give these a try and was shocked by how perfectly they fit. I can walk, run, jump, shake my head, laugh, yawn, put a mask on and take it off — these things remain snugly in my ears while also hardly feeling like anything is there.,I was so worried when I ordered these that I’d be in for disappointment that I double checked the 30 return policy with Amazon over live chat before they arrived. It’s been two days now since I got them and no way am I sending these back.,I love the fit and comfort, the low profile, the convenience, the charging case is small enough to live in the same front pocket as my wallet, and they actually sound pretty good. Don’t expect audiophile levels of sound but they’re not bad at all.,Very happy with my AirPods 3 and love that I finally get to own a pair without having to worry about them falling out like the previous design would.
"
Kieran Wood,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I will start with what is probably the best features of the airpods, which is by far the form factor. Both the headphones themselves and the case are super easy to go anywhere with. My old wireless earbuds were way too large of a case to fit in my pocket, whereas these feel like they could actually properly replace my wired earbuds due to their (shockingly compact) form-factor. I can get my phone and earbuds in one pocket, or my wallet/keys/earbuds in one pocket and my phone in the other, which is very nice. Tie in the wireless charging making it easy to keep my phone and headphones charged (though I've never come close to running them dry), and they work pretty well. But...,For how expensive they are I am going to critique them much harder than my last set of wireless earbuds (which were $40 and sound better than these). I primarily use these for working out, and while they are resistant to sweat it does make them slide out incredibly easily for me. That generally is my biggest complaint of all, the fit in the ear. I get you can't design a hard-shell for every ear, but I found the old design much more reliable than these, and also much easier to clean (the angle makes wax stuck in the crevice hard to get at). This is probably the most annoying aspect of the earphones by far since I bought them to work out in, and I constantly have to worry about them popping out, breaking, and having wasted the better part of $300.,Likewise I have a few other complaints:,- The actuation doesn't activate properly for controls when I have chalk on my hands all the time.,- Generally one-ear listening is very unergonomic with constant pairing abnormalities (going from paired to not paired), not to mention switching to one ear listening from two ears is a pain in the ass because your music pauses (they could fix this by having music restart when the other ear is back in the case),- The actuation feels weird with the haptics. Specifically because it is (I assume) force touch haptics you don't actually feel like it's clicking, but there is a slight audio cue that often gets drowned out by music and makes it hard to tell if you've hit it,- The fact that many of the features (adaptive eq, spatial audio [which I personally think is garbage anyways], and the more reliable h1 pairing) are not actually features of the headphones, but rather IOS features that these happen to implement since they stop working on android,- The price is insane for the actual quality of the sound in the headphones. Overall they sound *fine*, but again for nearly $300 I would like more than fine,So overall, if you happen to fit them well they're alright. They really are good as a pair of daily driving headphones with the form factor. Every other wireless pair of earphones I would not bother to take around with me, and would just use when working out cause of how bulky they are.  If you're on android be aware they will sound worse than the already mediocre sound they have on IOS (VERY open-back and pretty flat), and if that doesn't bother you fire away Just wait for a sale or buy them second hand cause they are not worth the insane cost..

Roberto Gomez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Simplemente el sonido es muy bueno , tiene un evolución en las frecuencias graves. Con un mayor cuerpo en el sonio en general.  En cuanto a comodidad tambien mejoro , lo unico es que tenia el temor de que se me cayeran pero para nada , hasta me he dormido con ellos puestos. Creo que a algunos no le pueden quedar pero a la mayoria que se quejan del fit, es por que no se los saben poner.  Por otro lado también tienen una mejora en la conexion con el iphone , es mucho mas fluida y de momento no me ha fallado ni una vez desde que los compre, cosa que si pasaba en algunas ocasiones con la segunda generación. Y ya por ultimo el incremento en la carga de bateria si cambia la experiencia, con esas dos horas extra ya no me ha pasado que se me termine mientras los uso. En general muy buen producto.

Jenny Dubois,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They're a bit bigger, with my small ears I was worried they'd hurt or be uncomfortable.. but no, they fit as well as the airpods gen 2.. just more snug, no need to push them in far.. just place them gently and they stay put.,The sound is amazing.. nice bass! 👍,Call quality also improved.. very clear and the person at the other end also says my voice sounds clearer than the gen 2 airpods.,BUT... somehow apple has yet to figure out how to filter out the background noises picked up by the mic.. For the person you're talking to, every noise around you is amplified x10.. washing your hands will pierce their eardrums! 😳  What's up with that?,Always have to be mindful not to do anything that makes a sound while on a call.. 🙄,Other than that I luv them 👍

  The Airpods (v3) are super easy to set up, and work very well with multiple Apple devices. I am particularly impressed with the quality of sound they have when using with my AppleTV.,The one quibble I have so far is that after they connected to the AppleTV, later I had to manually activate them for my phone, but this is a small thing that now I know it is necessary is easy to do.

  The headphones have the widest soundstage and the most accurate imaging I have heard from a pair of headphones. Turn on spatial stereo and set the Apple Music eq to flat. Noise cancelling is very fatiguing and makes the sound stage extremely narrow. This is why I recommend these over the AirPods Pro.

  Hace días los pedí creyendo que serían igual de cómodos como los primera generación o segunda generación y el resultado fue otro. No molestaban los primeros 20 minutos al traerlos pero una vez que les dabas 40 minutos o poco más de uso definitivamente comentaban a incomodar.,Claramente para algunas personas pueden ser los mejores respecto a comodidad por su tipo de oído pero en mi caso no lo fue así.,Respecto a la calidad de sonido es excelente, son unos muy buenos audífonos en ese sentido y no se hable del audio espacial que se disfruta aún más con Apple Music en dolby atmos.,En general yo le daría un 8/10 al producto.

  Purchasing the new generation AirPods have been an interesting experience. At first I absolutely did not like them due to the one fit design unlike the AirPod pros. After the first day I decided that I did not want them anymore but wanted to give them more time to test it out and after days of trying it out they grew on me and I actually decided to keep them. They sound great spatial audio is the deciding factor for me, light weight and easy to connect with your iOS devices. I would definitely recommend these AirPods if you want to see you money compared with the pros which is not really a huge difference in my opinion. 4.5/5

  Great audio quality on these - best of all the AirPods in my opinion. I was hoping to upgrade from my Gen 2s but as good as the audio/battery life/case charging is for the Gen 3s, they will not stay in my ear. Have tried them a few days and they keep dropping out of my ear. I am afraid I'll be stepping on one at some point. Going to have to stick with my Gen 2s and return these little beauties.

  Don't get me wrong, I love these airpods. But the fit is something I can't look past. It hurts my ears after about one hour of use where the OG airpods did not. Maybe they will come out with a redefined model next year. But I'm sticking to the og airpods strictly because of the fit.
"
Dharan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The sound quality was awesome but a bad fit on ears, not a perfect fit, and I cant feel the pods in my ears. Also, the call sound quality is not good, wired headphones perform well than this for calling feature
"
Fabián,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Los encontré por 2900 en la tienda de remates de Amazon, el único defecto era que la caja estaba rota pero los audífonos estaban completamente nuevos aún con sus sellos (2 gotas de Kola loka y quedó la caja como nueva 😅).,En cuanto a los audífonos, vengo de la generación 1 , estos suenan bastante mejor y los siento mucho más cómodos.
"
Antonio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Los airpods pro me lastimaban los oídos y no se me ajustaban correctamente con ninguna gomita, en cambio estos se adaptan bien a mis oídos y no se caen, tienen buena calidad de sonido y son perfectos para ejercitarse
"
Alex Clark,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love em, little big for my ears. Got great bass, great battery life. Good for talking on the phone also. I’d highly recommend these… was skeptics at first but so glad I bought them. Just wish they we’re a little louder and had even more bass. But I definitely surpassed what I expected
"
Nicole H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these earbuds recently and so far they are solid. They fit in the ear very well and I could almost forget they’re in the ear. Sound is really balanced unlike gen 2s and the battery life is very good. Simple setup setup and the spatial audio is very interesting. Overall 5/5 earbuds for everyday use!
"
Xiaowei Zhang,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It is quite a lot less comfortable than the 2nd gen for me
"
Mara Cordova,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Los AirPods son la mejor compra e inversión que puedes hacer, son súper cómodos y prácticos. No se caen y son ligeros además tienen un excelente sonido
"
Jesús Enrique Osuna Caravantes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  El audio espacial está de locos. No se podía esperar menos de esta actualización (3era generación). Me han encantado. ¿Y el envío? Me llego al día siguiente de haberlos comprado. Todo en perfectas condiciones. Gracias Amazon.
"
David Ross,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Kids can’t stop talking about how great they are. They have been showing their friends all the things they can do and how great the sound quality is
"
guy morin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Qualité de son , connectivité sont les plus . Je trouve la capacité à bien rester dans l'oreille un peu compliqué bien que je ne les jamais perdus mais on a pas le plus grand sentiment de sécurité à l'extérieur . Le son est quand même très bon .
"
Alejandro Lerma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  En general son una muy buena opción, son comodos, compactos, con excelente duración de batería y con un buen diseño. El único “pero” que les puedo poner es que se requiere de varios días para acostumbrarse a ellos y a encontrar la mejor manera en que se ajusten a tus oídos, no obstante los considero una excelente compra.
"
Noelle Roy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They are just perfect. The surround sound is insane. Easy to use, connects instantly to everything. Super comfy in the ears
"
Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Rien à dire c’est du produit Apple et tout est parfait.
"
Edgardo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Son un poco menos intuitivos que la generación anterior y a veces se conectan sin que estén en la oreja, pero se mantienen en su lugar y se escuchan  a la perfección
"
Ismael beltran navarro,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Después de 02 remplazos el tercer remplazo volvió a salir defectuoso. Pésimo servicio de entrega,  perdí tiempo entre remplazo, larga espera la atención al cliente mala. Mejor solicitaré rembolso no volveré a comprarlos aquí
"
MJ Hoss,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It does not fit ears properly, the shape is too odd. Would not recommend. The regular size ones are a better fit.
"
Daniel Huizar Sandoval,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  No ajustan bien en los oídos, en ergonomía son mejores los de primera generación, la batería está mejor pero por el aspecto de encaje en el oído, molestan después de un rato
"
Moisés Santana,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Tienen buena duración de la batería, y me gusta que sean resistentes al agua y al sudor, pero no son tan cómodos al colocarlos al oído
"
Ivan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I really don't like this product. It seems that its a copy, not the original one. I bought it and return it on the same day I received the parcel. Voice quality is very bad. Not worth it spend this much money on this product.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Earphones prone to falling out often, don’t expect earphone to fit to ear properly. Noise cancelation non-existent, especially in comparison to Pros, Earphone charging time a lot longer then Previous Airpod generation

Uncle Rusty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I needed a new Tablet to replace my aging Nexus 7, which I gave up using a while ago as even with custom firmware it couldn't be upgraded past Android 6. With Google being idiots and halting development in the tablet space after the failed Pixel tablet 2 years ago, it appeared that Apple was my only option for a high-end tablet.,This 4th-gen Ipad Air is a real treat. It has the same A14 Bionic Chip that's on the iPhone 12 flagship, which means it's one of the fastest ARM-based tablets in existence right now. It's arguably better than even the Ipad Pro, since it's on a more power-efficient 5nm process, so it's a better choice until they refresh the Pro next year. This new Ipad is incredibly snappy, and has no problem running graphically intensive mobile games or doing video encoding with ease. Unlike past Ipad Airs, this tablet provides great value and is a serious contender to the Pro at half the cost, while still maintaining a decent screen size at right under 11"".,IOS 14 is still missing a few key features only available in Android, but I think for most people it will be more than sufficient for most common tasks. My main complaints are the lack of notification toolbars like in Android, which allow for powerful shortcuts using IFTTT and other protocols within quick reach. Additionally, adblock support is still limited to plugins for Safari, and utilizing a DNS-based approach. DNS will work system-wide, but only works on your local WiFi network and not over a cellular network. It also misses some types of encrypted ads that are becoming more commonplace these days. It's too bad that Apple limits actual adblock plugins to Safari, as I much prefer using Chrome, but it's better than nothing. IOS is also still quite locked down, and I doubt that IOS 14 on the new Bionic Chip will be jailbroken anytime soon if at all, so modding is still very limited. That means no transferring of save games between Game Apps that have a Windows or Android counterpart, and limited support for gaming emulators, though quite a few are available which do not require root access.

JP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Finally decided to upgrade and bought the new iPad Air 4th generation. What a POS. Like another review mentioned, the battery life was not as advertised, used it for 3 hours and battery power was down to less than 30%. Would need to charge this thing multiple times a day if I were to keep it. Also, it would not let me set my password preferences, there was no check mark to indicate I was making a change, and then after asking for my password after EVERY song I tried to download in 5 min, then it mysteriously stopped accepting my password. Couldn't change preferences. Spent a total of 4 hrs on the phone with Apple support, (2 hrs one day, 2 hrs the next) and got transfered to total of 6 different people,including senior managers.  I was told It was a software problem, NOT a hardware issue and thus the iPad was fine.  Did a total reset 3 times, last time hooked up to a computer, reinstalled the software and.....still nothing. Same problem continued.  I returned it today and was told there are no more available ( of the one I want).  Meanwhile my 1st gen iPad Air is still working beautifully.  Apple has really gone downhill. So frustrating!!!

   I wanted something just to read on and watch the occasional movie in bed. This surpassed my expectations. I splurged just to do something nice for myself and I’m so glad i did. It’s so quick and connects automatically with the Apple Pencil 2nd gen and the resolution is gorgeous .The speakers get real loud. Perfect!

Crystal,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm new to apple, they seem to punish you for only owning 1 apple product.,Everything works wonderfully! I bought it for digital art and this IPad Air and the Apple pencil are WONDERFUL! So dang awesome.,However, I've owned it for a week. Set up required like 3 passwords, log on password, apple ID password, Apple touch password, all with different length and requirements. It was a nightmare to remember what needed which password and so naturally I got locked out and I desperately tried to figure out why it wouldn't accept any of the passwords I tried. Unfortunately I am at the ""Ipad is disabled, go to Itunes"" part. Trying to Reset or ""Restore"" the ipad out of just giving up didn't help either! It just error codes me to death when I follow all the instructions to do it from itunes!,If you don't have an iphone, another ipad in your household or a mac- you are doomed to pull all your hair out!,So- to summarize- it is fantastic to draw with, the pencil is like butter and the ipad works with it seamlessly!,It is not user friendly or forgiving if you don't have any other apple products and are forgetful (like me! I have ADHD. need to write down these passwords somewhere!) On the bright side, if you are super private and want to discourage anyone from getting into your stuff? This is great for you.

Rudy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A few years ago, i purchased the Ipad mini 2. i have had a on/off realtionship with tablets over the years. I really enjoyed the ipad mini 2..i switched to andriod tablet (BIG MISTAKE) and recently purchased this Ipad.,I primarly use this for checking email, facebook, reading and listening to music. I can't comment on the gaming aspect because i'm really not into games on a tablet.,Pros-,-Solid build (feels solid in your hand) no cheap construction,-Beautiful screen. colors are bright and vivid.,-touch screen responsiveness is second to none, no lag or delay at all,-long battery life (need i say more?),-great speakers! i have hearing loss in one ear, and wear hearing aid. ive found that even without my hearing aid in, the volume is adequate to hear.,Cons-,-USB C charging. I have mostly lightning cables (where i own a IPHONE XR) and i was really disappointed that apple changed to the USB-C cable. but that's good news if your switching from android, you don't have to buy any additonal charging cables. but where i have been using apple products for years now, it was disappointing to see that apple has gone onto usb-c cables.,-screen shows tons of fingerprints. (i do have screen protector on order, so hopefully it will fix the issue),-EXPENSIVE accessories (keyboards, and the apple pencil)- apple products do cost more but you know this going in..,Conclusion-,this tablet will serve your needs well, and there are tons of aftermarket cases and accesories for it. and depending on what you are using it for, it can almost replace your laptop. I find that the build quality of apple products is second to none..yes you will pay more up front, but that is the way things are..you get what you pay for.,I bought the wifi only model. didn't feel i would be using it outside of areas that didn't have wifi avalaible.,for the price paid, i'm very satisifed..apple tends to support their products longer than the competition, so you can easily get a good 5 years out of your ipad before it starts to become obsolete.,if you want a fast, relaible tablet with a beautiful screen, go ahead and get this ipad.

AMAZONaHOLIC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was initially in the market for a new iPad as an eReader. Figured I’d get the new iPad mini. Perfect size for reading. Maybe even 64gbs since my current library isn’t more than 64gb. I also know a thing or two about drawing. Considered a bigger iPad. Then I was given an iPad Air. 256 go. Since it’s better for drawing and because I may outgrow the 64 Gb one lol. I was very thankful and love my present. I have tons of apps/games/books. If I were to store all of that on my iPad it would take up like 150 gb. My phone has all of that on there. Currently just have procreate on my new iPad and my library of books. No music. Yet. Maybe. Unsure yet. I love the size for drawing. Got the Apple Pencil gifted to me as well. I’m having lots of fun with procreate. I got a paperlike shied. Absolutely like the matte finish and grainy ish texture. I do like the iPad Air for reading but it’s huge lol. I still have my mini and enjoy reading on that way more. I’ll most likely keep using that for reading. Occasionally read on iPad Air. Mostly draw on there. Lol the iPad feels like a bit of overkill for my needs. Maybe it’s because of all the storage I’m not utilizing. Maybe I’ll upload my LumaFusion app on there someday if I get back into editing home videos.,Update. Forgot to add that I had to return my first iPad Air 4 to Best Buy because of this shadow that shows up. Someone else in reviews calls it waves. But when you apply pressure to the screen, like testing your hand on it while drawing, in one particular area I’d get these shadows or screen disruption when I’d write near it. It bothered me so much. My iPad was returned. Exchanged for another. Same thing happened. Got another and it did the same. Now the one I have doesn’t do it at all. So happy for that!!! Smh. I did google this and turns out lots of others have had this screen disruption or what have you when drawing or writing on the iPad Air 4. Some people said the display models did it too. They called apple support and they’re all “unaware” of the issue. Some say they can’t exchange it if the display modes do it too because that means that’s what all iPads do and people can’t just keep exchanging them lol i have high high standards for apple and this amazes me. That they have this issue with the iPad Air 4. It’s disappointing and I’m just relieved that the one I have know doesn’t do that. Yet.. lol the other iPads did it like a day or two after some use. I’ve had this iPad for like a month. Maybe 2 months. No issues with it.

White boards. i find it really difficult to read though everyones docs, and follow meetings online, I'm just visual. Having an tool that really nails the writing aspect; i mean it really works has been so helpful. I retain information better, and i am visual so i can draw things out faster than i can in modeling software. it's really great. The performance of this is also really good.,What i ddon't like.,Feel strongly,- the battery life isn't as good as I would expect for this kind of device. I'd like to see all out usage 2 days (double). it drops fast if you are using it heavily. It eats though the battery pretty quickly.,- screen. it's an apple screen, but it doesn't seem as bright as all that. this is an issue if you go work outside. it's good, but an area for improvement. I suspect they are trying to compensate for the power usage, and possibly why they kept the refresh at 60(that was probably a good tradeoff given the lacking battery),- power button. Volume and touch button tedious. it' s an apple move. I want to hold down the touch button and have it turn off. Power down a device is a great way to conserve more battery, get a fresh start. it's not a bad thing,- storage, it costs too much. the base should be 128, for this price. I can get a 64 usb thumb drive for nothing. Give me a break.,Less strong (there are alternatives),- the keyboard case (not really this product) but i don't like that it doesn't protect the device, so i didn't buy it (well the cost is insane too) but i'd like to if not for those. Related -> Bluetooth is weak on this. if you pair a keyboard and a mouse you get lag. This sort of trade off i expect from cheaper devices not 600 dollar tablets. It's annoying. this might be the most annoying.,I know a lot of cons. They aren't all deal breakers. There's a lot of 5 star reviews, i feel like this is a 4 start product. Not 5. It's just that most other products in this category are 2-3. The touch, writing and media consumption are fantastic. As are the USB-C this was another fact that let me start using apple products. I'm not going to mess around with lightening connectors.  I do feel like though you could combine the capabilities of a MacBook Air/ or 13 pro with touch. I know there are some issues with where to place the speakers, charge a bit more and make a 2-1 device, like the surface. That said with the screen sharing I use the iPad and Mac in dual screen mode, and that makes it even more valuable. Your getting an external/monitor computer combo for 500 honestly not a bad tradeoff. That's why I left this last bit out of the cons. I feel a little mixed.

  Apple has finally understood the concept of what the middle child iPad Air is all about which is “Providing iPad Pros features, at a more affordable price”. This tablet is perfect for the average consumer, or students that want something better than the standard iPad but less expensive than the iPad Pro., I upgraded from the 2014 iPad Air 2 to the 2020 iPad Air 4th generation and I gotta say I’m very impressed of what they did. While the iPad Air has known to have most of the features that the iPad Pro has, such as USB C connector which is a huge improvement for people in business or education. But this tablet has to sacrifice some features, especially the 120HZ refresh rate, and Face ID to keep cost low but it’s something that the average consumer, student, or a business person wouldn’t care about, unless your an artist, a creator, or someone in the designing industry, then I would say an iPad Pro is necessary purchase to make if you're career requires the higher refresh rate and the higher GPU processing for graphic designing, video editing, or creativity.,Otherwise this tablet is perfect for anything from entertainment to web surfing, I even took notes with the Logitech crayon, even with the lower refresh it’s not the top of the line in class, but for my needs, it works just perfectly. I tested the landscape speakers and they are a huge improvement because the speakers are on both sides.,The only thing, I’m disappointed is the base storage on average 64GB works for most people, but at $600, it should be at least 128GB and then a $150 charge for the 256GB. But with apple focusing on keeping cost low, especially  being $200 cheaper, I guess they wanna keep the 128GB base storage exclusively for the top of the line tablets.,Overall I’m very satisfied with this iPad, I’m recommend this anyone that wants something better and more modern than the standard iPad without breaking the bank. For the love of god, please don’t buy the iPad Pro unless you’re work requires that higher refresh rate, and the GPU especially in designing, don’t waste money on features that you don’t need or ones your not gonna be using much.

  Truth be told, we’re an Apple family. Latest iPhones, multiple iPads, MacBooks, watches etc.. So I already came into this one expecting some good improvements, but did not expect it to be something pretty great. I decided to retire my 1st gen iPad Pro 12.9”, it was a great tablet, had it since day one it was released, but wanted something different, and a little more low profile. I was torn between the iPad Pro 11 and this new Air. The air, as far as internal specs, matches and even out performs a little than the iPad Pro 11, so with the lower price point, I figured why not. But man, hands down, this thing is pretty awesome. It feels great, with the square off edges, the thin bezels giving way to more screen real estate, and of course as mentioned, the performance. I was pretty pleased with the decision. But wait.. there’s more.. lol.,I decided to splurge on the steep price tag for Apple’s Magic Keyboard, which fits the Pro 11” and this Air. And hands down, this just elevated an already great purchase to the next level. With the track pad now being able to be utilized on the latest iOS and tablets, the backlit keys, and just the snappiness of the keys. Paired with a super easy magnetic pad to quickly place your iPad on and off. This thing is just next level. I find myself rarely reaching for my MacBook or getting on the desktop iMac. The USB-C’s versatility when paired with devices that can either output to HDMI, input SD cards, or utilize various different interface devices, this thing’s a power house.,For me, it works and then some. Only drawback is if you’re someone that wants the bigger screen, at 11” this is more than what I need for what I use it for. Other than that, I can’t think of anything negative. Sure you could argue it’s still using the Touch ID technology, albeit a much better improved version and it being on the power key to get rid of the old middle circle button, you may miss out on the Face ID apple offers in it’s Pro models. But other than that, highly recommended if you’re in between wanting to spend on the Pro models but also needing something with a little more “umph” than the standard iPad.

  The title says it all. No home button, which means you have to swipe up to close an app and try to do so without touching something on the app that you didn’t want to touch. Also a problem when the Ipad inside the holder I have as the holder gets in the way of the very bottom of the screen. The lack of non-screen borders also means you don’t have much to grab onto with your fingers when picking it up, and subsequently again touching something you don’t want to.,Then there’s the lack of an audio jack. Sorry Apple, but I’m not spending hundreds of $$$ on a set of bluetooth earbuds! Had to spend more money instead on a USB plug/audio jack splitter.,All in all, this generation of Ipad is a step backwards. My previous two Ipads were far better than this disaster.

  I got my iPad Air 4 from a different site, but I'll review it for shoppers here. The screen is 0.1 inches short of 11 inches, so it's not really noticeable in use unless you compare it side-by-side to the pro. The Apple Pencil works flawlessly. I did have to update to get the double tap feature to work. Please note, THE Apple Pencil DOES NOT COME WITH THE iPAD. I got mine customized from apple. The performance is very snappy and the battery life will last you almost all day depending on how much you use it and what you use it for. Switching out the proprietary Lightning port for a USB-C one was a great improvement, as now you are able to use USB-C Hubs and other connectors. The TouchID sensor in the top button recognizes my finger instantly. The iPad goes great with a wireless keyboard and mouse for typing anywhere you don't have access to a laptop or desktop. Overall, I think it is a great device who people who want good performance and don't want to pay the price of the Pro, but if you're thinking of getting this for a young child, you should probably go for the 7/8th gen regular iPad.

Dusty Stetson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Was thinking about getting a high end windows 10 laptop before I researched the iPad Air 4 and decided on getting this, and I love it. For my needs, it's much more perfect than a laptop, faster, lighter,and the build in apple apps are easy to use. This also cost much less than the high end windows 10 laptop I was considering.,I use iPad Air 4 mostly for organizing/filing paper records, taking pictures/videos, and streaming movies and entertainment programs.

  This model is my fourth iPad! It is beautiful and the keyboard addition I purchased transforms it into a mini PC! The battery life is outstanding. The screen is quality is great. I use this iPad primarily for reading the news paper and for PC tasks. I can move from room to room to watch TV from my streaming service. Great value, great product!
"
Doctor P,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Overall rating is for Amazon’s handling of defective unit. For the short time we had it, it was a nice tablet. The USB C connector is a negative for those of us who have a lot of Apple tech.  Problem is that after a couple weeks we put it on the charger (battery sill had reasonable charge, so not dead).  But it could not restart. Exhausted all known forced reboot/reset methods. Despite orders status showing “available for return by” (Including for the reason being defective ) Amazon is not willing to exchange it for a replacement unit. So review stars is downgraded due to Amazon customer service.
"
Erik R. Johnsen,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Work bought me this for testing. The design is terrible, hard edges with the heavy base hurt holding it for more than a couple minutes... need I say more for a device that's meant to be held? The bezel is HUGE for how new this is (not a good thing). There are better options out there.

"
Derek,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Got them for $160 so I can’t complain about that price however the noise cancelling isn’t as strong as I was expecting. Companies like Bose have a deeper noise cancelling in their earbuds. But for $160 great purchase
"

  Can't go wrong with this one, this the best Airpods ever
"
Magic_ida14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm surprised about how good the noise cancellation is! The sound quality didn't really improve but that's fine for me. The only defect is that when it's on noise cancellation mode, the AirPods feel stuffy in my ears. Otherwise, it's worth a buy.

  I have an iPad Air 2 which has served all my tech needs. I now have the blue iPad Air 4 which has a somewhat larger screen. I am disappointed that Apple does not make a translucent case cover for the air 4. What’s the purpose of having a blue iPad when you can’t see the color after you put a case on it? Other than buying a blue iPad everything else is as expected from Apple. I plan to keep this iPad for a number of years.
"
alicia howard,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Love it but it’s heavy and doesn’t come with much instructions for any set up, the cord is short and I didn’t get the plug,,,,,,! I have no way of charging it,,,,,,,,,,! I am going to call apple support and see what they’ll do for me, I bought the pencil again no instructions really, and I can’t charge or start it to use it, it’s pretty though, I set it up with my iPhone 11

Sofi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is the worst apple product I have ever bought in my life. It was fine at first, but after half a year the apple pen is glitching and the screen sometimes goes black. I wanted this iPad as a replacement for a MacBook, since they are so expensive, but this thing has just given me grievances. Save your time. Just spend a little more and buy a MacBook.

  Im in love with this IPad. I got the 256 rose gold one. It’s the first IPad I’ve ever owned so I can’t compare it previous ones.,I use it mostly for drawing but also for media consumption. My IPad is accompanied by a matte screen protector (paper-feel sold on Amazon) and the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil. Makes for a brilliant drawing experience.,Highly recommend! Perfect Christmas gift.

Jonathan Vance,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Very disappointed. The screen is cracked and I have no idea how it happened. It's not visible when you're using it, but I'm afraid it's going to get worse over time. It was put in a case as soon as I was done syncing it to my computer. Maybe it was delivered cracked? I previously had a first generation iPad Air. Seven years and the screen never cracked. Just very disappointed in the quality.
"
Alyssa,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So... This is no fault of Apple's because I love this IPad, especially using it with the new Apple pencil, but I was sent the wrong color because it was mislabeled by Amazon. Now the color I want is out of stock and doesn't look to be coming back anytime soon. Also returning it is a hassle since you have to get approval to do so. Ugh. Disappointing but whatever.

Neha Rao,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got this on the black friday 2020 deal for $50 off on the space grey color. Yes, I wanted the pastel colors since they're so brilliant but I figured if I can get some money off why not take the leap of faith and buy the regular old space grey? It arrived a lot sooner at my house then expected which was extremely pleasant. It is 10.9 inches as advertised, I got the 256 gb version since I am an artist, gamer, movie watcher and reader. I like to store a bunch of stuff on my ipad. This goes anywhere from art books/tutorials, videos, music, games, and all the good stuff the ipad is capable of doing. It's super light and very fragile looking so I put it into a case almost immediately. I also bought the apple pencil to boot. I am coming from upgrading the 2017 12.9 inch ipad so I downsized when I made this purchase. I really wanted a small computer to draw on and carry with me and this fit the budget and the need. If you haven't bought an ipad before or are considering upgrading don't hesitate. Buy it now! The color of the tech doesn't really matter once you have a case on so I didn't really whine too much about the loss of color. So far I've been really enjoying the quality of the product. Everything from the display colors (pure brilliance) to the ease and speed of utilizing the higher end technical features of the product has been a blast. Thank you Apple for making such an awesome product and Amazon for the incredible sale.

"
Eduardo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  During my time in college I needed something that has great battery life, small and portable and that can get work done.,Seeing how you can have keyboards with iPads, I went to buy one for the first time and the shipping came sooner than expected.,At first I didn’t have much confidence on Amazon since I don’t buy much online, but I’m glad that I made this purchase.,The battery life was amazing. Before I had a 14 inch windows laptop but I can’t take it anywhere without the confidence that the battery will stay alive. The iPad lasted me a whole day, sometimes 2 on a single charge (depending how I use it).,The screen quality was great, the screen moves easy and was capable of doing all of my work on it. It works so much better when you have an iPhone, with it I can copy and paste things from my iPhone to my iPad and not worry to type the entire link.,This is my first iPad and I would recommend this for anyone who has a bit of extra change for an amazing device.

"
Ed Frato-Sweeney,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  As someone that uses earbuds on a daily basis for multiple hours a day, I can say that there is nothing exactly wrong with the earbuds themselves. The problem is that I just didn’t use them enough for it to be worth it. I own a pair of $30 typical knock off earbuds that are just fine! I really don’t notice a serious difference in sound quality, and after a few days I ended up returning the AirPod Pros. I would recommend buying these to try out, and if you like them than great! But if not, take advantage of amazons free return policy and buy a cheaper alternative. Have a great day :)

  These AirPods paid for themselves when I blocked out the sound of my dad telling me what a disappointment his kids were
"
Marc G,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The description of these as “New AirPods Pro” is not accurate. The only AirPods that just came out are the third generation AirPods with the MagSafe charging case. It’s incredibly disheartening to see this misleading listing and description, and frustrating that no one at Amazon has noticed and corrected it. To be clear, I have the AirPods Pro and love them. What apple just announced and released are not AirPods Pro, they are the third generation of regular AirPods.
"
Boop,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Purchased directly from Apple, not from Amazon.,Sound quality wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t very good either.,AirPods worked without issues 5 times over two weeks and then developed issues. These were babied—no harm came to them in the two weeks I owned them. One of them began desynching from Bluetooth one morning, then then could not be resynched by the end of the day even with help from tech support.,Returned directly to Apple per their return process and awaiting refund.
"
AdventureInUtah,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  So I have every kind of earbuds you can imagine. Everything from inexpensive Skull Candy to Jabra and Bose. These are my favorites. I was skeptical and thought it was Apple hype, but these are outstanding.  They are soooo comfortable and don’t fall out when I’m running or working out. The noise cancellation is outstanding as well. The transparency mode is a nice option when you need to hear what is going on around you.  These are the first Bluetooth earbuds that I have liked so much that I carry them with me all the time.,Charge time is great and the case helps keep them topped off. I have worn them on cross country flights and never ran out of juice.,Also, they look good in your ear. I’m not a fan of how some of the other brands look, but these are great.,The sound quality is a trade off.  It is ok for every day use, but isn't as good as Bose or even Jabra.  The sound can get a little distorted at higher volume and is a bit muddy even at lower volumes.  For the price of these, I expect better but everything else is so excellent that I put up with it.  This is the best I have used for working out and activities, so I put up with it.  If I am wanting to really listen to music, I am using a different pair or my Sennheiser earphones.  I know it is odd to like earbuds where the biggest negative is sound quality, but the NC, charge, tracking, spatial audio, etc. is worth it to me.,Overall, a great purchase. I just wish I had gotten them sooner.,**********************************************************************************************************************************************,I rely on reviews when I make purchases so I put a lot of time into reviewing everything I buy on Amazon for personal and my business.

clockwurk,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm giving it 2 stars because these are premium buds. When it works, it's amazing. But noise cancelling stopped working to a known manufacture defect ( common problem, feel free to look up). Apple was kind enough to replace them the first time ( it took a week or so ), but my replacement's noise cancelling also stopped working. Its pretty aggravating for the amount I paid for this...

CHADMUSKA64,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  (I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FROM A FRED MEYER),I switched to apple last month. I'm in the process of buying all of the apple goodies! I got a FANTASTIC deal on a pair of these at Fred Meyer so I decided to pull the trigger. I see almost everybody walking around with a pair of Airpods. I didn't understand the hype until now! These earbuds are AMAZING to say the least! I currently use a set of Sony WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones. I wanted a comfortable earbud that matched or exceeded the amount of ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) that the Sony's offer. these Airpod pros do just that! the first thing I noticed when I put them in was the ANC. with just ANC on with no music the background noise is muffled pretty well. Once you get some music playing, outside noises cease to exist! the call quality is fantastic and I'm a huge fan of their slim size! My only complaint so far is how they tend to slowly slip out of my ear over time. due to this I always have to re-adjust them. this problem is easily fixed with a different set of ear tips made out of a less slippery material. as for the battery life, It's pretty decent for what your getting. I can get about 4 hours or so of listening time WITH ANC on before I have to recharge them. the case charges them up in a jiff and I'm back in business! the case allows me to get through my entire workday and both commutes with some gas left in the tank. I have yet to fully drain the case. all in all, I am very happy with these. I know that the sony WF-1000XM3 buds edge the pros out ever so slightly but I think the Sleek look and portable size make these superior!

Beachbum79,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had a number of generic headphones and on Black Friday I thought I would splurge for a premium brand to see the difference. I do like these earbuds however, I wasn’t blown away., Pros. I love that the case has wireless charging. These are the first earbuds I’ve owned with spatial surround sound and it makes watching TV more enjoyable. Apple added a button on the stem of each earbud instead of touch controls which I like. I find when having to adjust earbuds in my ears touch controls can be easily pressed by accident. It happens much less with these. The sound quality, I could go either way on. Yes they sound good and clear and there’s some bass there. But I wish you had more control, an EQ within an app or something., Cons. There really aren’t many. They could use more bass. I was surprised your not able to control the volume from the earbuds themselves unless you use Siri. The ANC is ok but not much better than some generic earbuds I’ve tried.,  Overall, I’d definitely recommend them to Apple users. Because all of Apple’s products work flawlessly together. I don’t think they are the best out there but there good. If you’d like cheaper alternative, I really like the Boltune Elite headphones for $35 at Walmart. Great sound quality for the price.
"
K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They're just good earphones. They've got a reasonably long battery life, unless you listen to music for longer than 5 hours at a time which I do not recommend since it will damage your ears. Sound quality and noise cancellation are excellent, especially for such a small pair of earphones. They're easy to pair and simple to work with. Voice calling is great, messaging and Siri are great. My ear canal is small but they gave adjustable tips that fit in my ears perfectly.,Two things to mention are that they are most worth it when you're using it with other Apple products, like iPhone/iPad/Mac etc., and that the maximum volume is not as loud as I had hoped, but it is still loud enough to hear anything clearly enough with noise cancellation mode on (and I have a slight hearing impairment so they may be more than sufficient).
"
Bukatetsu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've never been big on Apple products, came from 10 years of Android usage, starting in 2009. My wife loves Apple and after giving her my Androids, I decided to switch to Apple for her. When I first seen the price tag for these things, I instantly thought ew.,However, after tons of research, I found that these are only second to a similarly priced set of Sony BT IEMs. I picked these up for $100 off though, and I'm glad I got them. The sound quality, the integration to the iPhone 13 Pro Max 1TBs we have, and the features on them are outstanding.,I wish the molding seams were more flush though, for the cost, you'd expect some smoothly assembled pieces. Thinking of taking a super fine emery board to them. Those ledges/creases are gunk and dirt prone. I've seen some nasty looking airpods out there lol.
"
BC,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love Bluetooth ear buds! These AirPods pros are the best at everything - except staying in my ears! Doing dishes? They’ll fall onto the floor or into the sink. Vacuuming? Same thing. Eating, taking, or quietly sitting at a desk doing nothing? They’ll fall out every 5-20 minutes.,They are the best product I’ve ever owned that cannot be used. Bought a pair for my girlfriend - she has the same problem. Weird, neither of us had this problem with cheap buds. We are both switching to Bose and selling our AirPods :(,Note: We both tried every size ear tip and also bought expensive aftermarket tips. Aftermarket helped but the buds still fall out constantly - really sucks the joy out of music. Selling both pairs of AirPod pros to a person with ears designed for them.
"
Jesse Mitchell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They are easy to use, comfortable, and sound quality is good, but I bought these specifically for the noise cancelling feature.  When I first bought them I was absolutely in love with them.  The noise cancellation was unbelievable!  I have a loud car and when I put these in (while parked) I could not hear my car at all.  However, with each forced firmware update the noise cancellation got progressively worse.  I tried different tips that were supplied thinking that I needed a different size, that didn't work.  I then bought two different sets of tips off of Amazon (including the Comply Foam Tips) and the noise cancelling was still awful.  The newest firmware update, made the noise cancellation virtually obsolete!  So, I gave these to my daughter and bought an $80 pair of ANC earbuds off of Amazon and they blow these away!  My only guess is that Apple is trying to improve battery life by sacrificing ANC, but that is only a guess.  If you want these for other reasons, besides ANC, go for it I guess or just buy the base AirPods and save some money.  But, know that Apple is apparently messing with the ANC on these because a simple web search shows I am not the only one experiencing this issue.  These went from being able to drown out almost every sound to now I can hear my dog eating across the room with ANC on!
"
Desslok,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these fall of 2020. Worked well for a long time but developed a crackling and buzzing. Some research and I found out this is a known problem with a recall. I haven't figured out getting mine fixed yet. Don't know if theses are the same batch but being cheeper than the apple store makes me nervous
"
Joy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I wanted to love these so much. The sound quality was OK. But, if you wear them while being active, do NOT buy these. They will not stay in your ears, and tend to fall out at the most inconvenient times. My husband tried them, and they fell out while he was upgrading computer hardware . . . into the depths of the hardware. I tried them. I bend down to pick up the laundry, one falls into the washing machine, etc. What finally did it for me was when I moved my head slightly and they both fell off and into the garbage disposal. A complete and utter waste of money. Again, if you have a sedentary job, this could work for you. But, if you are active during the day, forget this product and try Powerbeats Pro.
"
Juergen F,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I really liked the ease of use of the airpods but the sound quality was poor and they always started to slip out of my ears after a while. I also had uneven sound and some issues cleaning the airpods after some time. After trying some other vendors in ear headsets, I finally decided to buy some refurb airpod pros and I have to say I really like them. They fit well and stick in my ears even if I am working out or go for a run. Sound quality is night and day compared to the regular airpods (2nd generation) and they are as easy to use as my first airpods. for iphone / ipad users, I recommend. You pay the Apple premium tough. I don't use the ANC hence I didn't rate.
"
Just peachy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I use these almost everyday.  I have Apple TV so use these AirPods to listen to my shows without bothering anyone else. ( Do you know someone who has trouble hearing the TV?  These are GREAT!! ) I have Apple music on my Apple watch so I can use these Air Pods to listen to music as I walk the beach (and I can leave my iPhone at home.) Oh, be sure to buy a colorful silicone sleeve for your new air pod pros ( available in lots of colors from AMAZON ) for about $10 or less.  These make great gifts!  Did I mention how useful they are when you are flying????  Noise cancelling means a lot less stress!
"
Damien Beckham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It’s true these AirPods are no doubt the best version the ear tips can be changed for smaller versions to go in your ear better. These don’t fall out of your ear once they’re in they stay in better than normal AirPods their battery isn’t as good but the sound quality is so much better. The passive seal the earbuds have in your ear as well as the active noise cancellation means you can hear your music in the noisiest of places perfectly. These do not come with a power brick, but they can be charged wirelessly and even on MagSafe charger. You are going to love these
"
Brittney,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I wound up in the hospital with a very bad ear infection. I still have problems in my now. It causes an allergic reaction with some people. Even with proper care. Worst purchase wish I seen a warning review before purchase.
"
Molly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are the best headphones I have ever had. I’ve always been a BOSE girl but I’m not turning back from these. Great noise cancellation, and the special audio is incredible. It’s like surround sound in my brain. INCREDIBLE. Some people are complaining about the weird shape of the end of the power adapter (it’s not the regular usb) but it’s literally the same as an iPhone charger.., you just use your iPhone charger to charge the headphones. So I don’t get why people are complaining. If you don’t have a usb-c power adapter just use a regular one with your Apple charger. I know I keep repeating myself, but jeeze so many people are complaining about this and it’s ridiculous. And also kind of hilarious.
"
Christian Melendez,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sleek and hard to grab, you better have hails to grab these little sleek suckers. They try to mimic a surround function to make up for and overall bad sound quality and a fully charged battery won’t last more than 4 hrs of use. I don’t mind the price if it was a decent product but this being an Apple product, it feels and performs like a knockoff. Better try Bose or anything else, Apple hasn’t put their stuff together regarding sound devices.
"
Mony Nhong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I wear this AirPod Pro with me all the time when I go out for eBiking on the trail. It has the greatest sound quality as if I was listening to a 7.1 surround sound system. Also work great for Zoom meeting at work or just meeting with friends and relatives. It is so convenient. I can wear it while multitasking at home like gardening, cooking, doing laundry, biking, joking, hiking, you name it. Take back you life. Use AirPod Pro.
"
Michael Short,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Had to have three pairs replaced before they fixed the static issue. Now, with the new iteration, I cannot use them for phone calls. Sound is great but the mic cuts in and out and whoever I'm talking with reports I cut in and out. These headphones need work to fully iron out all the issues. I feel like I've been using a product in beta lol. I've learned much about dealing with stress and disappointment over the last couple of years with these.
"
Spideyraccoon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Usually not a huge fan of earbuds because they fall out or make my ears hurt. These are great. I can wear them for an extended period without sore ears and they don’t work themselves out if I’m chewing gum or eating. The noise canceling doesn’t really work as noise canceling per say, but it does allow you to hear what you are listening to better and and allows you to keep volume lower. I am very happy with them & will be buying another pair for my daughter.
"
Landon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I first discovered this product when I was looking for some good quality wireless earbuds but were also affordable and then I came across these Apple Aipod Pros. These are wire-free earbuds with great quality, sweatproof, noise-canceling, transparency mode, and spatial audio.,The main strengths of this product are the noise cancellation, the sound quality they provide, and being sweat and water-resistant.,The strenghts of the Airpods Pro is they are water and sweat resistent this can be very useful in the circumstances of work.,Another instance that it would be useful is if you are using them to work out.,Two more strenghts of these Apple Air Pod Pros are they are noise canceling and have transparency mode.,Examples of when you can use these modes are if you have a noisey household or you just don't want people to bother you can just turn on the noise canceling mode and if you still want to hear then you can turn on transparency mode.
"
Allison k,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great for sound cancellation but that’s all your going to get. It’s waaaaaaay to touch sensitive that if your hair even touches the side off it, it turns off. It’s horribly annoying. I’m have to constantly turn it back on. Battery life isn’t great either. After a whole night of charging. I only got 30 minutes of use from one, until it was screaming to recharge.  The sound is actually very disappointing for being such a expensive product. Honestly just get a normal AirPod or any other wireless earbuds. Because yikes this is not worth the money at all. Feeling very scammed from Apple.
"

"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  If your looking at these after they have been out for 2 years, you probably know what your getting yourself into, and you probably know why you want these.,Yes, they are worth it!,I got mine from Apple directly, but should have checked on Amazon first for a price discount.,If you get them for a discount and there was a scratch on the package, that's probably why they were less and as long as they function well then the package did it's job to protect them.,I looked at my earbuds and they do say that they were put together in Vietnam.,Obviously nothing wrong with that, in fact the build quality is so excellent I can see why Apple choosed these manufactureres to assemble their luxury product!  Well Done Apple!
"
mesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are a great upgrade to the AirPods I had. The noise cancellation has greatly improved. I sound quality is much better & the battery lasts much longer. I love the size reduction. They fit in my ear so much better. I’m very happy I purchased them from Amazon at Christmas time at a reduced price. Genuine Apple quality.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ear attachments come off in the ear.  no grip to them, easily dropped. Engineering horrible - can't adjust them without activating controls (skipping sone, stopping).  Can't get them to stop randomly playing songs even after turning off iPhone music app. But something else.
"
Manuel esquibel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought these directly from Apple website. The noise cancellation makes a weird scratchy noise when I have them activated. That started maybe 6 months into using them. I’m a audiophile so I need good highs lows and mids when it comes to music, these just don’t cut it. They sound very cheap like if they were the fist generation ear phones with the cord. I have some jbl ear buds and those sound waaaay more cleaner and crisp then these. Don’t just buy these because they are Apple. Throw your ego out and actually buy things that are good. These Apple AirPods. Not that great at all.
"
Jamie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I love them, but they did not fit my ear shape well. I ended up swapping in third party foam tips and this made them fit way better, as well as having a better seal.
"
jordan the lion,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I received these as a gift 2 Christmas as a go and I have barely ever been able to get them to connect to my Samsung phone. I have tried 2 different phonis 2 different phones and almost always it cannot even read the airpods being anywhere nearby. If it does somehow sense and see the airpods when I try and connect 50% of the time it says there was an error and it can't connect so I end up spending 15 to 30 minutes of my workout time just trying to get my phone to acknowledge these airpods and I would say 70% of the time I end up not even using the airpods because it's too much of a hassle and I can't get them to connect
"
Patrick Bollin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Noise cancellation feature is amazing. I can tune out my inconsiderate roommate who likes to party on work nights and get some sleep. Spatial audio is great too! Battery life is a little weak compared to other headphones, but phone call quality and music quality is great. People are able to hear me clearly as well.
"
Rachael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I wasted money (probably around $200 total?) on multiple cheaper pairs of ear buds. These are still the best. They’re even decently durable; I’ve painted a house, taken showers (neck down), walked through the rain, and dropped these. They’re good little head phones.
"
steven mccracken,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I upgraded from the regular Apple ear pods and glad I did. They sound better and have more features. The noise cancellation is great when needed and the 3 sets of buds makes it easy to fit in your ear. Definitely worth giving them a try.

Alex Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I got these as a gift and I love them. I put them in at the gym right after work, aka peak hours, and the only thing I could hear was the faint noise of the awful music they play from the gym speakers. The environment went from loud conversations and slamming weights to almost silence once I put them in.
"
Vita,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pros: noise canceling, Wireless, Easy to connect out of box and case when needed, battery life is great so far, call quality good and perfect to just listen to music, you can use one at a time, and can be a good distance from your device before it gets staticky,Cons: They may slip out from time to time depending on your activity, could be a little smaller to fit better in the ear in the future

"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I would say that these are Good overall.  Sound quality and noise cancellation is good.  The battery life that Apple claims these have is absolutely not accurate.  I use these in the gym for about 1.5 to 2 hours per day.  I get 6, maybe 7 days of use out of these at average volume and sometimes using the noise cancellation.  I would say at best these will give about 12 hours of listening time before the case and airpods are dead.

I can hear distinctively every instrument.

  Clearly visible mismatch between the two parts of the ear plugs. Never seen this on my AirPods 2. The gap has sharp edges. It’s ok to put them in the ear but definitely can feel it when you touch it with your fingers. Considering to return it but not decided yet. Not sure if I’ll get a new one made in China or Vietnam.
"

  The only downside about the earbuds is the fact that the ear rubber piece is meant for noise cancellation which means it pushes your ear wax further down the ear cannel.

  These are the real deal. I seen someone complain about say that the AirPods were made in Vietnam therefore it’s bad quality, but that’s not the case. These are official Apple AirPods with official parts just in a different manufacturing site. Also saw someone say that these aren’t “New”, and sorry to say it but they aren’t new, but upgraded. They now include MagSafe charging. The noise cancellation and transparency is perfect, packaging was top tier! Also seen someone say that this doesn’t include a power adapter, of course it doesn’t! When have you seen headphones nowadays that come with an adapter!?!?
"
Pablo E,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a huge step from the original ear pod Apple me… I was astonished by how good the quality of sound is especially dynamic surround where as you move your head the music follows and noise canceling is a game changer… I’ve never had a noise canceling headphones but now I don’t think I can ever go without another pair of noise canceling headphones,My initial impression before the package arrived is this would probably be marginally better than the original Apple EarPods however it is a night and day game changer and a huge step up from the first generation

  I’m already in the Apple ecosystem, so for my first earbuds, I wanted a seamless connection experience. These do not disappoint at all and the spatial audio blows my mind.  I did not realize NC tech had come this far. The only minor issue I have is with battery life. Wish it were a little longer. These fit comfortably in my ear and more importantly the noise cancellation has changed my living space to one of peace when needed (mostly  during WFH hours). My neighborhood is full of noise during different parts of the day and I WFH; I need the ability to focus without distractions, I.e. loud cars roaring by, new home construction across the street, kids screaming during playtime next door. 🙄 The previous earbuds and headphones I had do a decent job of blocking noise but I needed something much more effective for my FOCUS time. The airpods pro have been a game changer.

  We bought these for my son who is always listening to music while doing homework, doing nothing, and doing chores if we can ever get him to do them...lol! He has a set of 2nd generation Air Pods that someone had gifted him last year, and they seem to work well for him. He's an enthusiast for his choice of music and we thought he'd enjoy these as he doesn't seem to like the Beats over ear headphones. Well we were right, he hardly takes them out, and the noise canceling works pretty well as he doesn't hear us half the time from the other room. I tried them myself and there's a major difference between the 2nd gen and these Pros. The bass is a lot more profound and I don't hear as much outside noise either. I would recommend these over the 2nd Gen, and I would imagine that the 3rd Gen can't compete. If you love music and the quality you hear then don't waste your money on anything less than Air Pod Pros.

  Purchased these as a gift for my son. So far he’s in love. Says, “ the sound quality is better than before, noice cancellation, he uses at work, & play, it is not 110% the best, but good enough for a apple product”. He’s had all apple products, some he hasn’t been too happy with, earbuds that utterly suck from the apple store. “These have been made way better thus far”, well so he claims. We will see in a couple weeks. He did say, “battery life not all that”.
"
Aixa Schulist,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Wow! These are awesome. Sound quality is crystal clear, noise cancellation is life changing! And battery life is perfect for me (use about 4 hours a day) I just charge when battery starts go get a little low, which for me is every other day. Unfortunately for me I already dropped one and it’s scratched pretty badly. Do I definitely recommend some protection if you’re clumsy like me! I give them a 10/10 way to go apple!

  I am not a headphone person. But I could not resist the BF price. Turns out that I like it! I was really surprised how much of noises it cancels out. And the pairing is quite easy —especially  after watching some videos on YouTube on how to set it up. It is comfortable to wear as well. The only problem left now is that I have to remember using it.
"
The Paying One,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are almost on the top of the market but far from perfection. First, the battery life is way too short. Second, the charging indication is somewhat limited, no way of knowing if you are fully charged or not.,If you leave it charging overnight it gets warm. For the money more functions could have been added.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazing sound quality, clear, true, and great bass tones. I tested them out by first listening to 2112 by Rush - that’s what I judge good earphones by. Astonishing! Then went on to classical, rock and jazz - these are just perfection! They are pretty comfortable too. I couldn’t ask for more, and I highly recommend them!!!
"
EZWins123,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had high hopes for the “top of the line” Apple AirPods Pros. After using the Sony WF-1000XM4’s these are absolute garbage. The Noise canceling shouldn’t even be considered as such. It canceled out MAYBE 20% of the outside noise, where the Sony’s create absolute silence for peaceful listening. The AirPods Pros do not sound any better than the regular AirPods. The only thing I see good about these is convenience, and for some, “status” or “flexing” on others who can’t afford them. Even that isn’t why you should buy these.
"
Alan Richel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I use it primarily to sing karaoke on my iPhone and sometimes I can’t hear the song and all I hear is static. I don’t know if that’s the fault of the phone or the AirPods. Otherwise when it works its great and it really does cancel all the noise around you.
"
Byron Kotongan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods Pro are a great! I can’t imagine using anything else, they are the perfect addition to my iPhone. Siri is my best friend lol. I listen to music all day, receive/send phone calls and texts and have great hearing protection at work. I bought another pair and they’re just sitting in the box still with the AppleCare Protection. Just had to have another set on standby. If you don’t have an iPhone then buy one, match it with these and maybe a watch.

Christian “Kakarot” ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  They fit so comfortably in my ears that I can't even tell that they are in. The noise cancellation is on par for sure as soon as I put them in I can't hear anything else. I even turned up my music on my speakers in the house to see how loud they would be and I gotta say that the Pro's trumped my house speakers. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and look forward to having them everywhere that I go. The true test will be at work lol that's where it's the loudest. After a test run with them, I have total confidence that they will be sublime.

  I am a fiend for good sound quality. I have tried a boat loud of headphones and earbuds when I was on my android. I recently switched over to an iPhone and I decided to get me a pair AirPod pros. They have got to be the best sounding earbuds I’ve ever used(besides the ones I use for games on my console.)  they are so loud that it can actually make your head hurt at makes volume. The noise canceling also helps with you, and to be honest, it’s really helpful not hearing all the background noise

And they are! much louder and better sounding than the airpods, i never have to listen to it past 75% in order to have it be loud, they stay in my ears well and the noise cancellation works amazing as well as the transparency mode so i can wear my headphone and talk at the same time. Expensive but well worth the price!

  My one year review: Case battery life is worst than AirPods 1, since now charging in the case causes to FULLY DEPLETE, so if your AirPods didn’t charge to max they will be left on, since the case is the only way to tell your AirPods to stay off when inside.,They made these AirPods pointless, and I am a very light user. (At all times on AirPod is in my ear and rarely both)

  Son efectivamente los originales, partiendo de esto el diseño esta increíble como el detalle de los audífonos y el estuche. La sincronización es tan fácil como acercarlos al iPhone o iPad, el sonido es muy bueno, el volumen mas alto suena bien, fuerte y con buenos graves. Vi una serie y el sonido se escucha como si no trajeras audífonos, como si el audio se escuchara en el ambiente. Y son cómodos pero luego de varias horas puede cansar un poco.,Si quieren estos audífonos valen totalmente la pena. Solo recuerden que es para puros dispositivos de marca Aple.
"
Arii,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Son muy bonitos y se sienten de buena calidad como es de esperar por parte de Apple, hay unos detalles que no me terminaron de convencer, uno de ellos es que la cancelación de ruido no es tan potente como la imaginé aún así te puede llegar a salvar en momentos donde hay ruido, y la batería no es que les dure mucho, de ahí  en fuera todo está muy bien, excelente calidad de sonido y se conectan muy fácil al iPhone, por si se lo preguntan, si, son originales, no he tenido ningún problema con ello.

Perfecto pero dudo que lo uses seguido. ¿Originales?Si, traen # de serie válida en la página de Apple, y garantía. ¿Ensamblados donde? En Vietnam, este es el único punto negativo ya que denota las líneas ,fuera de eso vienen : AirPods sellados y nuevos , cargador Lightning , gomas , y manuales. Calificación final : 9.6 de 10✅

  La neta son preciosos, y te ves bien fresa, pero no le veo nada de mejora al sonido con respecto a los AirPods normales. El aislamiento es leve no es tan bueno como en unos Senheisser, Bose, Sony o inclusive los Beats Studio. No se me hace que realmente amerita ese precio con sus cualidades, para mi te deja debiendo. Ya al analizarlo mejor hubiera comprados los AirPods normales y con el sobrante le pongo funda y accesorios jejejejeje.

Eric Reyes,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Como siempre excelentes audífonos para iPhone, totalmente compatibles y súper fácil de enlazar a tu teléfono, una vez que los configuras y después ya solo abres la caja y se conectan automáticamente a tu iPhone, si estás escuchando musica y te quitas uno del oído automáticamente se pone pausa, lo mismo con los videos. Muy Buen Noise Cancel sin ser el mejor y buena calidad de música pero le falta en los bajos. Si los quieres para llamadas y escuchar música casual son los mejores, si son más para musica me iría por unos Sony, Beats o Klipsch.
"
Andrew,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This Product has great quality sound compared to a lot of other buds out there.  The noise cancelling uses the external mics to measure itself with the outside noise to quiet it down.  This means that quality will flicker very low occasionally when loud random noises occur.  For example, constant loud, bumpy roads will make the quality flicker.  Aside from this, the noise cancelling is quite good.  Transparency mode is great, you can hear outside noises well.  The quality and build is great.  Great sound too.

  I'm an old man.  My hearing is shot. I can't afford $2000 hearing aids.  I've tried inexpensive ones but they aren't customizable and don't have Bluetooth.  The Airpod Pro is perfect for me.  Has almost all the features of fancy ones including customization.  I can hear conversation again.,If you've got everything running (transparency, Maps, phone calls) the battery runs out but you can recharge in a couple of minutes and get multiple charges from the case before charging it.,I'm getting my wife a set.

"
Sergio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Sinceramente es la primera vez que tengo unos AirPods Pro y el sonido es bueno, más no es lo máximo, supongo es debido al tamaño de los mismos. Cumplen con su función que es permitirte escuchar música y hacer llamadas. La cancelación de ruido es buena para ruidos fijos como los de un motor, pero si estás en un ambiente muy ruidoso, no esperes que desaparezca por completo, ya que ese no es su fuerte. Llega un momento que se salen de tu oído aún usando las almohadillas sugeridas, no es que salgan volando, pero van saliendo poco a poco y pueden caerse si no las volviste a ajustar.
"
Ihsan Chughtai,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These are very good quality pods. The noise cancellation is awesome I wasn’t expecting they would perform as good as they did. Also they do fit perfectly but you do need to go through all 3 sizes to see which fit perfectly for your ears.,The only issue is that they come off easily if you sweat so during workouts they are not good. Also they are quite pricey.

gustavorv,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Llegaron 5 días antes de lo previsto.,Venían muy bien empaquetados, me llegó mucho tiempo antes, al momento de abrirlos se emparejaron de inmediato con el celular. No había ningún inconveniente al destaparlos, una observación que quiero hacer; después de más de 2 hrs con los auriculares la oreja me dolía un poco, cabe mencionar que tiene las almohadillas que vienen de serie, otro punto que veo mal es que con el uso del abrir y cerrar la tapa tiene un poco de juego esperaba un poco más de calidad y no estoy seguro si regresarlos o no. Pero es un hecho a tener en cuenta, puede que con el tiempo o tapa llegue a caerse.,Dejando de lado todo eso los AirPods Pro son unos auriculares muy buenos.

  I was skeptical about a large company like Apples attempt to recognize good sound. But this airpod pros are actually unreal. The balance is very nice and has clear lows and highs. The noise cancellation is literally worth every penny, was blown away at how well they cancel noise and how much better it makes the sound without cranking the volume. Gonna live these for a long time.

  The pair I got wouldn’t pair to any device. After all troubleshooting was done still wouldn’t pair. Had to take them to the apple store the day after they arrived then proceeded to do more troubleshooting. Then they tested them to make sure they weren’t fakes. Not a great experience.
"
Alejandro García Marcos,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Aún sabiendo que existen mejores opciones en el mercado por un precio similar yo me decanté por estos debido a la versatilidad del dispositivo, soy una persona que diariamente sale al trabajo y ocupa transporte, camino largas distancias, hago ejercicio, estudio y como punto personal es que a veces me da un poco de ansiedad los ruidos que generan las multitudes como las voces y así, así que el hecho de tener cancelación activa en un centro comercial, en la calle o en el transporte público me genera mucha tranquilidad y felicidad; el modo transparencia es sorprendente aunque hay una cantidad de ruidos muy específicos que se saturan un poco, lo cual habla del buen alcance que tienen los micrófonos incluso para captar sonidos a distancia larga o media, el modo transparencia es tan bueno que no necesitarás quitarte los audífonos para hablar con alguien, su batería nunca me ha dado problemas incluso cuando los ocupo durante todo el día, la conexión cuando abres la caja y los sacas es muy veloz aunque siento que podría mejorar para la próxima generación de airpods ya qué hay veces donde quiero consultar la batería y se tarda unos cuantos segundos en desplegar la pantalla de información, y por último y lo más importante para muchos de nosotros, su calidad de audio es más que suficiente, no es para nada mala, aunque si lo único que te interesa es calidad sobre funcionalidades y versatilidad puede que no sean para ti, pero el hecho de tener una calidad ligeramente por encima del “suficiente” (lo cual podría etiquetarlo como una calidad de audio buena-excelente) en unos audífonos tan pequeños y versátiles se agradece demasiado. Perfectos para aquellos que estamos en constante movimiento todo el día, eso si, las gomitas sellan muy bien el canal auditivo por lo que tienes que tener cuidado con el tamaño que seleccionas para las mismas, al igual que siempre será recomendable que primero conozcan qué tan bien se adaptan ustedes a los audífonos de gomitas ya que es por ello por lo que mucha gente no logra acomodarse a estos audífonos.,PD: También depende mucho del ecosistema en el que te desenvuelvas, su funcionalidad con dispositivos apple es perfecta pero si cuentas con un android o la mayor parte de tu ecosistema es android puede que existan mejores opciones.
"
Edgar,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Buen sonido, las notificaciones se escuchan de los audífonos, sin embargo ninguna de las almohadillas se ajusto a mis oídos y tuve que adquirir unos ganchos de plástico adicionales para que no se salgan de las orejas y se estropeen, el cargador MagSafe es cómodo y se integra completamente con Apple Watch para subir y bajar volumen, cambiar canción y seleccionar aislar ruidos o escuchar sonido ambiente, un poco arriba en precio para las prestaciones de sus competidores
"
Ricardo N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Compré ambos los airpods 3 y Pro ya que estaban al mismo precio para ver cuáles eran mejor.,Para empezar, los 3 se me caían cada minuto y en mi opinión no se escuchan tan bien como los pro. El noise cancelling de los pro hacen una gran diferencia y por el mismo precio valen más la pena aunque tengan 2 años en el mercado. De seguro los Pro 2 serán anunciados dentro de poco tiempo pero por el descuento que tienen actualmente es muy buena oferta.
"
Erin Storer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Some of these issues may be individual to me but no matter what size silicone tip I used they fit one ear but the other always felt like it was falling out,,Also, noise canceling would change mid meeting unprompted and they would often turn off while I was walking and I’d have to keep turning them back on (something I’ve now heard extensively in other reviews).,For over $300 I expected better than the no name $24 ones I’d been using and I got worse.

  We bought a set of the AirPods Pro for my daughter's birthday, and she loved them the minute she put them in her ears. She's had issues in the past with ear buds because they kept slipping out, but the AirPods come with a few different sizes, and they now fit her perfectly. Finally, a birthday gift from her parents that won't be returned!  They were also on sale for a reasonable price given the quality of the product.

  Los audífonos son espectaculares, una maravilla; no obstante, no los recomendaría pues al ser intrauriculares, me causaron tinnitus con tan solo dos días de uso ligero (volumen a 40%).

  Had an great deal on amazon and had yo pull the trigger. No regrets at all. By far the most confortable and best sounding earbuds I have ever own. Yes the battery life is the the best in class but with the mag case it’s more than enough.
"
Xiaowei Zhang,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It might not have the best noise cancellation or the best sound quality, but considering they are wireless earbuds, they do a damn good job

Erick Eduardo Rico Hernández,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Es la primera vez que pruebo unos audífonos con cancelación de ruido y la verdad me encantó, aunque gracias a eso me di cuenta que mis orejas son diferentes, pues en mi oreja izquierda queda perfecto y el derecho no tanto.,Por el precio de Amazon que es más barato que el de la tienda oficial, vale mucho la pena

  Los airpods pro son excelentes, pero el problema es que estos son el lote de vietnam, se sienten mucho mas corrientes, se sienten las conexiones entre los plasticos, son mas ligeros, en general se sienten corrientes y de baja calidad comparados con los mismos que tengo pero del año pasado sin magsafe, es muy tedioso que apple haga estos cambios de calidad tan de golpe conservando los precios, tambien puedo decir que se acaba la bateria mas rapido y tienen mas glitches con el BT, al principio pense que eran replicas pero la cancelación de sonido es muy buena

  I really love these AirPods, I work as a mechanic at a warehouse and it’s really noisy there. With the Noise canceling these have It blocks the sound from outside and you can hear everything from the AirPods. The sound quality is great for the price also
"

  Materiales con la calidad que apple nos tiene acostumbrado, la calidad del audio es buena y nada mas, nada que sobresalga, la cancelación de ruidos funciona muy bien pero en decremento de la calidad del audio.

Lily,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I thought it was like fake from seeing other reviews but I saw also soMe people said it was real, so I got it… and def real. I really didn’t understand the hype at first but they are really comfortable and the noise cancelling is kinda cool.

Jesusalberto234,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Los compré el día miércoles en la tarde y el día de ayer llegaron, el envío fue muy rápido y en cuanto a los audífonos son completamente originales y nuevos, el sonido es excelente y los distintos modos (cancelación de ruido, modo ambiente y Dolby Atmos) funcionan muy bien, tenía miedo de comprarlos y me llegaran unos usados, pero, todo salió bien, todo sellado y sin ninguna imperfección, los recomiendo completamente.
"
Christian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Son los mejores audífonos inalámbricos para iPhone que puedes comprar, el sonido está de lujo, la batería es muy buena y la conexión con dispositivos Apple es maravillosa, lo único que no me convenció completamente fue la calidad de construcción al ser un lote hecho en Vietnam, pero solo si eres una persona muy quisquillosa lo notarás. 1000% recomendado es la versión nueva compatible con Magsafe.
"
Art Deco Design,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The AirPods PRO are worth the extra cost. They deliver great sound directly into the ear canal and stay in much better as well.
"
Mark,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Se oyen muy agudos, la cancelación la pierden una vez que empieza la musica, ademas en ratos se oye un tronido en el derecho, los bajos que presumen, sólo son en contadas canciones, apenas entra otro instrumento y estos desaparecen por completo, lo único bueno es que para audiolibros se oyen muy bien, de ahí en fuera, no valen la pena, en las películas las explicaciones ni se notan.
"

  La verdad es que yo soy una persona que diario está en el gym, entonces su uso es intensivo, solo que al gym al que asisto ponen canciones medio pinches, así que con estos AirPods Pro, simplemente activó la cancelación de ruido, pongo mi música preferida y a darle, la tecnología de cancelación es una joya, 100000% recomendables y en oferta, súper ganga
"
Jen ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods Pro’s are amazing, they work very well and I was super surprised how well the noise cancellation worked. I’m pretty sure they are really and if their not then I can’t tell a difference and nether can the actual AirPods Pro’s. Other than that I 100% recommend these for a gift!

Transplanted Scotian into Kazakhstan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The biggest issue I have with the Airpod Pro's compared to the first generation is fit.  The first gen, you could easily exercise, workout, run whatever with them not falling out.  I find with the Airpod Pro's they fall out a couple of times per workout.  Sound is fine and the noise cancellation works well.

  I have never had an Apple product though my husband and son love's them. I was a solid android person. But, after having a tablet that did not last more than a few years when his laptop lasted over 12, I decided to give it a try. It is very easy to use. I was afraid I could not manage it but it is easy to adapt. I might have a harder time with the Laptop but this is just like any other tablet in regards to ease. It's quicker than my old tablet. I've had a couple of questions but answers are easy to find. My husband always wanted to buy me one but I stuck by android tablets. I am so happy I bought this. So worth the money.
"
Cal P,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I've been using an iPad 6th Gen the last 2 1/2 years and loved it. I really didn't _need_ to upgrade, but I started watching tech reviews on YouTube (out of curiosity to find out what was out there) and ended watching a couple dozen before deciding I wanted a new iPad.,During the process, I 'decided' on every model from the 9th Gen to the Air to the Pro 11"" to the Pro 12.9"". The only one I didn't consider was the mini. Had one before and didn't like the tiny screen. I could afford any of them, but I realized there wasn't one single thing I do that requires the new M1 chip and the other upgrades in either Pro model. The Air, however, would be a HUGE upgrade over the 6th Gen and more than I could make use of.,So, the practical side won out and I opted for the Air. I've had it for several weeks and absolutely love it.,Data transfer from my old iPad to the new was an absolute breeze, and within 15 minutes, I was using the new Air. I now have twice the storage (64gb), more RAM, and everything loads in remarkably fast. The screen display is markedly better and watching a video on it is simply amazing. I'm still convinced I wouldn't have noticed any difference (or not enough of one) to justify the extra money for a Pro.,Apple is launching a new iPad Air in March or April, but it doesn't have enough new bells and whistles on it to be worth waiting for so I chose to buy an ""older model"" which was still a huge upgrade and have no regrets.,I had a few Android devices maybe 10 years ago or so, and I will never go back. Say what you will about Apple, but I love the whole 'environment' and the way my iMac, iPhone, and iPad all integrate.,I a word I couldn't be happier. Oh, and I got it for $30 less on Amazon.

Shiro,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have a laptop, smart phone and always felt what void would a tablet fill…?,I bought this one on a deal because I wanted to sketch and read some PDF ebooks, papers etc.,now I use this a lot more for so many things. It’s wonderful tool for painting and sketching especially with some really good apps there are. It’s also good for photo editing and taking down notes with Apple Pencil.,Fun making music on garage band.  It’s not a must have, a luxury item.,A bit disappointed that there is no flashlight no default calculator app and the camera is alright.,Maybe a bit old school, but I still need my laptop
"
Charles Howse,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Great small notebook! Quiet and competent, really light, great battery life, decent size hard drive. I use it mostly for PhotoShop and Lightroom, with photos stored on network drive and LR catalogs on USB hard drive. I do wish the machine had more than 2 USB C connectors, or add a USB 3; more connections are needed!,I have a keyboard and mouse and an external monitor attached via hub with USB 3 and HDMI, plus an RJ45 Ethernet connection  to network, and have had a couple of hubs that don't work properly with the Mac.
"
Brian Welch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Amazingly Close to IPad 11 Pro!!! Same cases, screen protectors and many other accessories that are interchangeable. Nearly the same performance minus camera/movie capabilities at 2/3’s the base cost. Just a little problem using the Touch ID on power button with cases. A lot of times it doesn’t get all of the print and forces you to use PIN code before you notice its attempted to many times. Other than that I’d get the IPad Air instead of iPad 11 Pro unless you plan on making tons of high quality movies.
"
Reed Ramlow,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I gave my wife a new Apple iPad Air as an early Christmas gift, and she's happy with it, so far. The key will be battery life. So far, so good. It's lighter weight than her last iPad. I would have preferred Face ID, but didn't want to spend the extra Benjamins to get the iPad Pro, as the Air is sufficient for my wife's needs. I assume Face ID will be available in the next iPad Air version, right after we purchased this one!
"
Anthony p.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  First off I don't really like the ios. I think that it is more complicated then it needs to be, and I don't like having to use Google to use my iPad. Yea the battery is ""ok"" but for as long as you use it that's how long it takes to charge. And I have the finger print lock on it and that works fine when it gives me the option. Most of the time it tells me I have to enter my pin to enable the fingerprint lock
"
AMER Corp,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Terrible latency issues and connecivity compared to other devices.  For the cost it is beyond me why anyone would pay so much for rhis crap and all the accessories needed to protect this fragile garbage.  Apple the gig is up and everybody knows Android is better.  The plan to indoctrinate children in school has been outed and apples to apples, the products and company suck.
"
MeeMaw,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought this to use at work when I couldnt use the work computer.  I use it at home to surf the ‘net without having to drag out my laptop.  The camera is pretty good.  Now I use it to play amazon music during my work day and still do personal things from time to time when at work.  My kids keep trying to take it from me.  I also have the magnetic keyboard and Apple Pencil.
"
Margarita Viera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Is the best Apple air I pad. I have the first Ipad that Apple brought to the stores and there is a huge difference. Screen quality is awsome. Touch screen is insuperable and battery life great.,I am still finding new things in it.  The camera better than the others. I also bought the magic Keyboard it turns my Ipad air into a laptop. Will recommend both.
"
Tommy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am very impressed with the Ipad Air 4. The platform build quality is absolutely fantastic and the battery life is really good. The apple pen Gen 2 is so nice to use. I mostly use it for Internet research/browsing, watching movies and a few games. The Ipad Air 4 screen quality for watching movies, videos and games is just beautiful. The A14 processor handles all these tasks perfectly. Excellent product!! Everyone should get one!! Well worth it!

   What’s good Lord fast. My kids love them. The only bad thing I can say about this is the shipping. Horrible shipping it says it arrived two week before the iPads arrived. It was not clear when they should arrive.

  Great IPad but sort of minimal improvement from IPad Air 2. However, great for someone looking for a first IPad or to upgrade memory like I did.

  As usual overpriced apple product. Yet this is worth it as it is slightly less costly than the pro model. Has almost every feature as of the pro model except lidar, lesser screen refresh rate, and a couple of other things. Comes with the new Apple A14 processor.
"
Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The most amazing thing about the iPad Air 4 is the battery life that just keep on goin! This thing will last you all day on a single charge no matter what you’re doing. It’s also so so great for drawing when used with the Apple Pencil. This device is such a great tool for work and drawing. I don’t have a keyboard for it but if you had one I would image this thing is definitely a laptop replacement for simple work like emails and document writing. I love it!!!
"
William,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Switched up from an iPad Air 1st generation.,4 out of 5 stars because you’ll need to add ~$100-$300 to the price tag for a quality pencil and keyboard if you want to get the most productivity out of it. If you’re just going to watch YouTube/movies, get the cheaper iPad 8th gen for half the price with no need for pencil or keyboard,Some Features,- light,- 2 speakers with 1 on each side, the other 2 grills are just fake,- comes with usb-c to usb-c cable and charger brick

  It's fast, beautiful resolution, feels good in the hand.  I very strongly recommend that you buy it from AMAZON, not Apple.  Amazon ships reliably, Apple itself is slow and not dependable in delivery promises.

Andrea P,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I had an old iPad, I have never used it much. My wife wanted one for her birthday and so I decided to buy one. She is obsessed with it. When I could finally take a look at it, I found out that Apple have gone a long way. It is definitely worth the money. Super screen, fast, good for streaming, the pen is very useful. I am thinking of buying one myself.

Ritchie Hernandez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't like ordering from the Apple Store as everything seems to require a signature...works great if I can get to the door on the first knock because there won't be a second one and by the time I open the door, she's 1/2 mile down the road. Now I'm stuck with a receipt and have to wait 24 hrs before I can go pick it up. Tough to do when dealing with a severe spinal injury.,Amazon leaves it in the designated area on our porch and all is well.,As for the iPad...it's the newest technology and works very smoothly. It does everything at a high level including the 4 speaker system. Pair it with a good quality Bluetooth speaker and it will provide hours of excellent entertainment or background music. Been buying iPads since 2012 and this one is the best so far.

Ziggisoo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  The iPad itself is good. The issue I have is with the charger. I purchased the item in Australia and I was sent a USA charger which meant I was unable to charge the iPad. I contacted the seller who advised that in the small print under the model number, a bunch of letters and numbers means it’s from the US! Seriously, as if a reasonable person would know that. From reading the reviews after the fact, I can see this is a repeat reported issue. They should be more up front with this rather than trying to hide it. When I emailed them I was offered an adapter and the picture attached is what I received!,So, the small amount of money I received on this iPad was spent on purchasing a genuine Apple charger for Australia! My advice, would be to enquire first and ensure you are receiving a product that you can actually use immediately in Australia.

Ivan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A venda foi ótimo, chegou bem antes do prazo previsto. Apple tem garantia internacional. O iPad é muito leve, fácil de usar com a caneta e vou migrar fácil pra ele. Ainda não tenho certeza de que 64GB foi a melhor escolha, mesmo tendo 2TB no iCloud. Vamos ver com o tempo. Mas junto com a Apple Pencil 2 ficou tudo o que eu precisava.

   Comprei no dia 1/11 e recebi hoje, 03/11, entrega mais que rápida! Sobre o produto, não tenho muito o que falar, pois Apple é excelente, sempre. O preço, todo mundo já sabe, é salgado, mas é um aparelho que vai durar muito tempo, se bem cuidado! O adaptador de tomada é padrão americano, como outros já apontaram aqui, mas é algo simples de ser resolvido!,Vocês que estão em dúvida, pode comprar sem medo, entrega garantida e qualidade Apple!

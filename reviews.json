{"profile-name": "JK Reviews", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.", "My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.", "A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop \"umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store\". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.", "Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.", "Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.\n"]},

I converted from PC ~ 2008 and have loved every apple device until the IPhone X and the new Macbook with M1 chip. Where to start? First, as is a major complaint for everyone, the Macbook pro has all of two ports (yes yes, I know, this was listed in the specs. It doesn't make it ok). If I need to be plugged in, I have 1 port remaining. It is incredibly idiotic that I have to buy a dock to expand my ports. Oh and the ports are only Thunderbolt in Apple's continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage. I did not buy a Mac Air for a reason, yet the Macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an Air. The new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense. The track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless. I have no bluetooth connectivity. I get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music. I see zero performance improvements with the M1chip. In fact, doing a side-by-side video recording with Quicktime (all parameters equalized) I have a severe lag with M1 Mac, but not with the Intel driven machine. And the touch bar is about the worst idea ever. I constantly dim the back light, or go back on web pages because of it. Absolute trash. I bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns, because that's how terrible it is. I will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming Macbook Pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed.", "So now begins the massive switching costs for foolishly demonstrating brand loyalty to a company who has none for its customers.\n"]},
{"profile-name": "mkidwel2", "review-star-rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I really wanted to love this laptop. I've had only Macs for years. This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16\" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13\" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out.\n"]},

When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using \"swap memory\" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files.

But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air.  (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)", "Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output.  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old.  This is unacceptable.  Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.", "Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM.  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.)", "Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  Would I buy one again? Perhaps -- it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of it.", "The good things:", "Keyboard, touchpad, Built-In Screen, Build-In Speakers, Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows, and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows.  Also, comes with a Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Program -- now, it is better just to use something really Libre -- like LibreOffice.  But, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for Microsoft Windows.\n"]},

For heavier tasks, it of course doesn\u2019t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn\u2019t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running.

I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.\n"]},

But, there was always something that stopped me from getting one. They always mentioned that the Air wasn't very good, from 2011 all the way up to 2019, reviews always mentioned the multiple flaws MacBook Air had; from the thermal throttling, to the super small SSD (128 at base price), over $1000, then the Butterfly Keyboard etc. The list went on and on, and I really thought that it wasn't worth the money. Until, WWDC 2020, Apple announced they would start making their own chips straight from home, I was so excited for this new generation, it reminded me of the time when they went from PowerPC to Intel. The excitement was there, and I loved the new unibody that started in 2016, with the removal of unnecessary ports for the average Joe. Everything was the same, but the new M1 chip. That is when I realized that this M1 MacBook Air was the one for me. I didn't hesitate and started saving until I had enough to buy it. And, I absolutely made the best decision in purchasing it. It is amazing, it's super slim. portable, super fast processing speed and power. The screen is beautiful, the bezels are unnoticeable. The keyboard is outstanding, To be completely honest, this laptop makes you want to be more productive, just because of its speed and its ease of use.

I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.", "The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.", "The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.", "Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine \"has NO USB PORTS!!!\", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.", "All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.

No ports for SD cards, or USB. (I bought numerous external ports (spent at least $60 on numerous devices) and still I am always forgetting them. I would at least love this feature to come back and/or will to pay extra for this feature.  This is probably fine for most users but for anyone working with arts, graphics and using different programs etc. this is a real inconvenience. Mac has continued to make its products less compatible with other computer brands.. Overall this will be my last MacBook, the drop and drag, and numerous features that made this a great computer and easy to use, were awesome but are no longer worth it. Oh yeah, also I lost numerous movies that I had purchased off of my iTunes, I contacted the iTunes customer service and no help.  Pretty much I am sad, and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules, like not only needing memory space on the computer (which mine is not full) but my icloud is full, after only 5 or 7 months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop.  So I watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless, and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them. So now I changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and I can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop. Apple has been a throne inside and I caution those who are working on arts, coding etc. to save the stress and frustration and stray away.

{"profile-name": "Chris", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  First off, let me say, I'm speaking as a tech enthusiast with a decent understanding of gizmos and gadgets. I've owned Windows PCs, a MacBook Pro 2014, and a few Chromebooks. This is, by FAR, my favorite computer that I've ever used. Period. Let me start with my favorite aspects/features, in lovely bullet points for your viewing pleasure:", "-Battery life. Oh my god. I have to TRY to kill this thing in one day. Full brightness, playing The Sims 3 or World of Warcraft, Spotify playing, Safari AND Chrome open in the background... I went from about 100% to 85% in an hour. And that's the most I could do. Usually, I start the day at full battery, then use it on and off all day, and the lowest I've gotten so far is ~40% by bedtime. It. Is. Insane. Not to mention the standby, which is basically 1-2% drop in a day. I cannot stress how amazed I am by the efficiency of this machine.", "-Speakers. Okay, I know some people don't mind a tinny little laptop speaker because they use headphones. But I am not that person, I like to be able to just play music or videos out loud and enjoy them. Well, these speakers are also the BEST I've ever heard on a laptop. It's got such a full, defined, crisp sound, I can hear a lot more of the dynamic range and background effects than any other laptop I've used. It also gets LOUD, I can use it to fill my room with sound, and in fact I've had to turn it down a bit at night because my roomies down the hall can hear it. The bass is the only point that isn't a home run, but for what it's worth, I can definitely hear the bass. It just doesn't boom. Overall, amaaaazing!", "-Keyboard. Short and sweet, this is my favorite keyboard. The previous spot was my 2014 MacBook Pro, but this surpasses that. The keys travel well, I make less mistakes, and it's quiet and comfortable. Not much else to say, it's just really good.", "-Screen. Still a gorgeous Retina display, crisp, bright AF, colorful, and easy on the eyes thanks to True Tone. I'm not an artist or video editor, so this is just coming from an average consumer.", "-Touch Bar. I know this is a divisive opinion, but I personally really like the Touch Bar! Some apps take advantage of it, and it really helps. Spotify keeps the controls on the bar, so I can switch and adjust music without having to switch back to the app. The sliders for brightness and volume are easy to press and slide, and frankly I just enjoy it. Touch ID on the corner is also LOVELY for logging in, making purchases, or filling forms out on webpages. One touch and you're good. Brilliant.", "-Form factor. I love this skinny slab of aluminum. I'm a minimalist, and it just pleases me to hold and look at. This is completely subjective, but I'm a fan.", "-Speed. Oh my god. This thing is legitimately the fastest computer that I've ever used. I'm honestly shook at how easily it handles anything I throw at it. It runs World of Warcraft on High settings at 60fps. No other MacBook could do that, the 8 core graphics chip really lives up to its specs. I can have tons of tabs open, a game, things updating in the background, and this guy doesn't break a sweat. All while absolutely SIPPING battery.", "-Fans. Yes, the main difference between this and the M1 Air is that the Pro has an active cooling system. That being said, I've heard the fan come on about 3 times in 3 weeks. Even when running all that stuff I said before. I'm befuddled by how great the thermal dissipation works in this thing. It's good that it has fans, even if it barely uses them.", "Less good but still aight:", "-USB-C ports. Yes, there's only 2 on the left side. Yes, I had to buy an adapter for HDMI and USB-A. Am I mad about it? Not really, I only need to use those things when I'm docked at a desk anyway. I use a bluetooth mouse or the touchpad, and I have AirPods for headphones. So I don't need to plug many things in anyway. But if you do, definitely invest in an adapter. I use one by Anker, with 3 USB-A, an HDMI, and an ethernet port.", "-To add to the USB-C impressions, I still miss MagSafe, so I actually purchased a \"magnetic\" USB-C cable, which you put the receiver in the MacBook USB port, and the cable magnetically attaches to it, just like the old MagSafe. This makes me feel safer, because a firm USB-C cable sticking out the side makes me nervous, if I were to drop it or hit it on something and mess up the port. Highly recommend a cable like this.", "-Price. It's expensive, there's no way around that. But I'd consider it an investment, because generally speaking, Macs last many many years over their Windows counterparts. And since this is the first to use Apple silicon, I'm sure it will be supported for a long while.", "-Webcam. It's just not great. The AI enhancements are definitely noticeable and make you look better, but at the end of the day, its a 720p webcam in a $1300+ computer. Come on apple, is 1080p that hard to add?", "-App compatibility. While I have had almost no issues, some apps may not play nice with the M1 right now. The only real issues I had were that The Sims 2 Deluxe collection does not work, which I discovered is an issue for everyone with the M1 Macs. But luckily the devs say theyre working on a fix, so hopefully it's just a small number of apps with issues. Other than that, every other app has worked great.", "Verdict: I love this computer. Sometimes I just sit and marvel at it. Sometimes I pick it up just to feel how nice it fits in my hands. It is legitimately my favorite computer, and if you're willing to make the investment, I think it's a fantastic computer for most people. If you don't need the Touch Bar or extra oomph from the fans, the M1 Air might be for you. But for me, man, the M1 MacBook Pro is THE laptop king. Or queen. 5 stars from me!", "Update: I've had the MBP for about 2 months now, and I'm still completely in love with it. I stream on Twitch, and I can run OBS, a game like World of Warcraft, Spotify, Discord, Safari... all without a hiccup. The only real time I get the fans running is when I do this. I have seen the temperature of the cores spike to about 204 degrees Fahrenheit under load, but it's never shut down. It throttled once, as I noticed a slowdown, but I was running literally all those apps plus a discord video call, so I assume either the 8GB of ram couldn't handle it, or the cores got too hot. I was really pushing it though. Battery is still amazing, and I can run WoW Classic on max settings easily. Overall, still impressed, and still my favorite machine EVER!\n"]},

After I brought up these issue, the Genius Bar assistant became nervous and tried to run a diagnosis test. He couldn\u2019t because one of the USB C port was broken. After checking the only other USB C port, the battery was entirely drained and failed the diagnosis test.

Now 10 hours battery on a laptop isn't unheard of, but considering the other two strengths of the laptop, performance and thermals, it more impressive than it would usually be.", "Performance is great, easily matching or beating much of Intels 11th gen lineup, and thermals are outstanding. In the few weeks I've owned the laptop, I have only heard the fan turn on during benchmarks, and even at full load, the cpu barely gets above 60 degrees c, far lower than the toasty 95 degrees that the intel chips get to under load.", "The screen is great, but as an apple product that is to be expected.", "Now all of this is great, but it all comes with one massive caveat; Rosetta. Now rosetta is great. it allows basically all intel software to run on the computer, and this is great if you are a pro user waiting on software developers to update to native code, but its bad if you have, for example, chat software that hasn't been updated. even simple programs running under rosetta chew the battery life, and that isn't ideal at all.", "In the end, this laptop is great. It is very powerful, quit, cool, and fast. the only thing currently holding it back is lack of native software support, and as apple silicon matures I expect that issue to be solved eventually. Overall I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone that is willing to pony up the steep asking price.\n"]},

I know people who don't have more than one Apple device hear all the time that having more than one always works great because of the ecosystem but usually only take it at face value. I was one of those people even up until I had my Apple Watch for a while but the MacBook really hooked me in. Once you realize how everything just works you don't know how you were able to do it before. Of course there is the whole walled garden argument everyone that dislikes Apple love to talk about but in reality I don't care if this walled garden is at war the rest of the world it's the best, most simple, and seamless ecosystem for the average consumer. There is a learning curve for those that come from other operating systems like the different feel of the keyboard, shortcuts, trackpad, and overall OS. But I've only been using this device for short while and already caught on super quick. I feel like despite all these positives there is still the high price. I purchased the 512 GB model and it came to around $1400 with a sale so it might take a while for the slight buyer's remorse to go away but I feel like the more I use it the quicker I become satisfied with my purchase. My final thoughts would have to be, if you have the money to purchase this at any configuration then go for it. Simply keep in mind there is a lot that goes into the satisfaction for this product; the ecosystem which would require more apple devices, the willingness to learn a new OS, understanding the added level of security and privacy that comes with Apple devices and the use case for each individual.\n"]},

So, why did I get another one? I'm about to start nursing school at the end of August which requires you to have a laptop all day (about 8 hours). My dad surprised me this MacBook. I am an apple girl through and through (watch, phone, AirPods). To say that I was over the moon receiving my first MacBook was an understatement. I've been testing it out for about a week now. It came in perfect condition. No scratches or problems with the screen. This computer is FAST when it comes to everything. As soon as you open it, it is on. I seriously can't catch it off no matter how little I open it. Every web page pops up quick and loads quicker. I'm amazed that I can text through this MacBook and it synced all of my stuff from the cloud effortlessly. It has a Touch Bar that is insanely cool and in my opinion, useful. The battery life. OMG the battery life. I purposely did everything in my power to drain it. I am on day 7 of using it without charging it and it is at 41%. Now, I haven't been on it all day everyday. I have mainly used it to write, read, and text. However, I've used for a good 4 hours each day. If you're a college student who needs a reliable computer this one is for you!!!!

{"profile-name": "Social science professor", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  Over the past 10 years, I've had five MacBook Airs and three MacBook Pros (my employer provides a new one for my work every few years, and I upgrade my own at home every 1-2 years).  Most recently, my personal computer has been an early 2020 intel quad core MacBook Pro and my work computer an early 2020 MacBook Air.  The brand new M1 MacBook Air is my favorite by far, and fixes everything I didn't like about the MacBook Air & Pro introduced in early 2020.", "The M1 MB Air's battery life is amazing, I can use it all day and still have 50-60% battery remaining.  My previous MB Air and MB Pro gave me around 5-6 hours of battery life (despite Apple promising ~10 hours) - which was barely enough to get me through the day.", "I'm also loving the the fanless design, silent operation, and increased performance.  Even though I don't do much video editing, my workflow can be taxing on the computer:  I regularly run lots of apps simultaneously, including Zoom for teaching, many open browser windows, Excel & statistical/database software, and a connected iPad I use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over Zoom.  The new M1 MacBook Air handles this easily, and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan.  The MB Pro I've used since April (the one introduced in early 2020 with Intel quad core processors) also handles this load well, but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes.  The early 2020 MacBook Air buckled under this load, it gets very hot and the fans are screaming.", "Besides the better battery life, silent operation, and robust performance, the new M1 MB Air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous MB Airs.", "The MB Air's display doesn't get as bright as the MB Pro's display - that has been true for years, but it has never been a problem for me.  I would only need the display to be brighter if I were working outside on a sunny day, and I just don't do that.", "I really love the keyboard on the new M1 MacBook Air, which is the same as the keyboard on the early 2020 MB Air & Pro, and MUCH improved IMHO from the butterfly keyboards on the previous MB Airs & Pros.  It is quiet and super comfortable for typing.  When typing very fast, my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly-style keyboards.", "This is subjective, but I really prefer the MB Air form factor - the wedge shape and slightly lower weight - compared to the MB Pro.  I also strongly dislike the MB Pro's Touch Bar.  I've had two different MB Pros with Touch Bars and they were nothing but trouble for me.  When typing fast, my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the Touch Bar, which would trigger a command (like launching the Music app), which would interrupt my workflow.  I know other people don't have that problem, and other people find the Touch Bar useful, but it's just not for me.", "For me, the MB Air speakers (on this and on the previous model) are quite good for movies or YouTube videos or Zoom/Facetime calls.  The microphone is perfectly satisfactory, though for Zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos I usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better.", "The webcam is still disappointing, even though image quality is SLIGHTLY improved over previous MacBooks.", "The external design is exactly the same as MacBook Airs from years past.  I like the design pretty well, but Apple will redesign the MB Air & Pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer.  I will want one of those and might regret that I didn't wait.", "But for now, the M1 MacBook Air is the best MacBook I've ever had, it fixes everything that I didn't like about previous MacBooks (except the webcam) and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way.\n"]},
{"profile-name": "J. Hansen", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  (Heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but I wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).", "The MacBook Air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. One caveat that has always plagued the MacBook Air of year\u2019s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the \u201cPro\u201d line). That was why I always got a MacBook Pro in year\u2019s past. This time around, when Apple announced the new M1 chip, I was curious, so I watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new Air (the Air has the same chipset as the MacBook Pro, with the same GHz at 3.2, while saving $300). I am on a budget, but I also didn\u2019t want to sacrifice performance, so I was a little nervous I was missing out by not getting the Pro, but thankfully I have not had to sacrifice a thing.", "I am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign, etc. I previously purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-March when I made a grievous error and went out and purchased a Lenovo Yoga C940 with 16GB of Ram, Intel i7 Processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. Buyer\u2019s remorse soon followed as the Yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. The only thing that I liked was the speaker set-up and the 4K touch screen. Other than that, I was beyond disappointed. I sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 MacBook Pro, until I purchased this Air.", "So the pro\u2019s:", "Fantastic battery life\u2014I have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. It will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you aren\u2019t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like I do. It\u2019s great to know you don\u2019t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and it\u2019ll still have battery to spare). A win in my book.", "Heat management and fanless design\u2014I am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why I always love the MacBooks and detest Windows (hence sending the Lenovo back).  The fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. I don\u2019t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. I also like that I don\u2019t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. I can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry I\u2019m blocking a fan exhaust.  Again, another win in my book.", "Slim design\u2014at 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you\u2019re lugging around a brick. I also liked the tapered design as it\u2019s a little more ergonomic than my MacBook Pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. It\u2019s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.", "Keyboard\u2014gone are the butterfly mechanisms of MacBook\u2019s past. One thing I really missed when I gave up my 2015 MacBook Pro was the keyboard! Thankfully with the new Air and Pro\u2019s, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.", "Trackpad\u2014I love, love the force touch trackpad. I still believe Apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. Hands down. It\u2019s smooth as butter.", "Performance\u2014This is the little machine that could. It puts my 2017 Pro to shame. It also outperforms the Lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. I can have multiple tabs in Safari open, Photoshop, Apple Music, Microsoft Word, and this doesn\u2019t even break a sweat. I also like that I can do some light video editing on this. For most people\u2014especially college students\u2014this computer\u2019s power should be more than sufficient. Keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the Pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. Again, that\u2019s if you\u2019re editing like multiple 4K videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average Joe that may only need to do the occasional video project\u2014no problem! This computer can handle it!", "Screen\u2014It\u2019s nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like I do.", "Speakers\u2014I am a music junkie, and I have to constantly have music going when I\u2019m working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. Good stereo separation and punchy. They could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but that\u2019s to be expected for such small speaker drivers. I am more than pleased with them. They also work good for binge-watching shows on Netflix.", "The cons (there are few):", "The webcam\u2014it\u2019s a 720P webcam, and well, it looks like a 720P webcam. It\u2019s a little grainy and washed out. It will do in a pinch, but you\u2019d think in 2020 we\u2019d get an upgrade on the webcam.", "The lack of ports\u2014in true Apple fashion, the I/O is somewhat lacking. You have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external GPU, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that Apple\u2019s M1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which I am sure will be resolved in future iterations). I would have liked to have seen at least one USB-A port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. But that\u2019s just me being nit-picky.", "M1 chip running Intel apps\u2014because Apple\u2019s M1 chip runs on ARM and most apps are coded for Intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new Apple chip natively (like Adobe Creative Cloud). You might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. So far, I haven\u2019t really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. I am sure here soon it won\u2019t be a problem. Again, it\u2019s nit-picking.", "--", "To sum up: this MacBook Air is a winner. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and I would absolutely buy it again. You get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the Pro line. I am very happy with this computer and think I might just have come as close as I can to the perfect laptop for my needs.", "Happy shopping!\n"]},

I constantly come back to the laptop and it says \"Please report unexpected shutdown to Apple.\" This has happened at least 8 times with no response from an Apple Technician. Then the camera quality for a 2020 Machine is something out of the 1990s. It's horrible, I look grainy and I bought this laptop for an MBA program. If you want to run many programs at once, even with upgrade RAM and Processor, you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off CONSTANTLY. The. fan. does. not. shut. off. Sure it's portable, sure the \"build\" quality feels good in the hand. In terms of performance, spend the extra money and don't get this. I'm quite embarrassed I shelled out over $1k for this.

{"profile-name": "Diver", "review-star-rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I have both an iPad and iPhone so I thought is would be make sense to have a Mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were.  To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7.  The Mac Air's battery life is much less than advertised.  The claim is around 10 hours, I doubt I get 5, and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff.  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom.  The battery life of the Surface is better.  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC, but the differences are minor and manageable.  But documents open more slowly on the Mac, and mine has the M1 chip.  On the Surface, documents usually open immediately.  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac.  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it.  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Mac's native software.  So I downloaded VLC.  It works fine on the Mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store, including Firefox.  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either.  On the other hand, the Mac has a better screen than the Surface.  While the Surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and I almost never use it as a tablet.  When I am not sitting at a desk, I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface.  The new Mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the Surface.  So a mixed bag.  As I mentioned, I like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac.  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but don't know if I want to spend the extra money.\n"]},

This machine is so well thought out. I got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. Don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine IN ADDITION to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. I digress. The only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. It needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.", "All these reviews are usually full of crap. It's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. This time it's true. This architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. I 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. I don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use I'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. What a great product. It really really is. This i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. After 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with TPM chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device.

There are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if Apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. I have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. I'd imagine there will be a strong response fro Intel, amd and the software companies.  It's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. I mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. That's all most people are going to need.

In my school days I did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer. Now I do not have to do that at all because I only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its 30 hour charge. Next, the apple compatibility that it uses, including Apple music, iMessage, Facetime, etc., makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text. This apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so. Finally, is the processing speed and storage. The MacBook Air 2020 has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer. This makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life. Although it is expensive, the MacBook Air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the MacBooks, including computers such as the MacBook Pro. The strange thing that the MacBook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel. The storage that is available with the MacBook is 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB, but most went with 512GB.

The multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done.  For example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button.  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value.  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store. It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have.

The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market. I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read. Kept saying I need a usb3.0 to work. So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately. I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it. The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people. But for me it was not. Apple already doesn\u2019t give us headphones anymore and they don\u2019t even have the decency to give us a very good cable. 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one. Last apple laptop I will ever buy. O and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it.\n"]},

This MacBook\u2019s upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also.

This M1 Chip is designed by Apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. This BigSur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts Apple as the highest revenue electronic company.", " Battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. Many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. All day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. This MacBook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. These batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. These are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment.", " Good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. This MacBook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. This MacBook has eight GB of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. Having enough memory and storage is great. For example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. If there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. A lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur.

I have had different laptops before highschool, like Chromebooks, so I knew what I liked and did not like. After about two months of searching, I landed on the Macbook.  When researching which laptop to buy for highschool, I landed upon the Macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the Macbook, like touch I.D. and Siri.", " The modern aspects of the Macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. The first one is fingerprint recognition. When I had old laptops, I always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. Now, however, Apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which I find extremely useful. Between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. Now, though, all I need is my fingerprint and I can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. Also, the Macbook comes with Siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the Mac. There are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. But, Siri makes it easier. To activate Siri, all you have to do is simply say \u201cHey, Siri\u201d and the assistant will appear. Siri responds to what is said, so if I say, \u201cHey Siri, find \u2018Review 2\u2019 from Google Drive,\u201d the document will appear seconds later. Although the modern technologies of the Macbook are important, just as important is the software.", " Many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to Apple\u2019s Macbook. First, the Mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. Safari is the Mac\u2019s main browser, so what happens if for some reason I need to use Google Chrome? Well, the Mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, Google Chrome, Safari, and Bing. Also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. Most laptops are meant for business or school, like the Macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the Mac for games. Sometimes, after school, I explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. I expected the Macbook to do somewhat poorly, but I thought that it actually did pretty well. Another reason why the Macbook is great is because of the battery.", " The batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. The Macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a Chromebook. When I first used my Macbook, I used it without charging it until it needed it. How long did it last after starting at 50%? Almost one day with no charge. The Chromebook I had when I was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. Also, the battery uses an optimizing system. When the battery is below 30%, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. This helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. Not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop I have had.", " The Macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. From the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the Macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do.

I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about. ( I'll try to answer some questions I had ) It does come sealed in the original Apple packaging and it does have the M1 chip. All around I highly recommend this. It's amazing for the price tag.\n"]},

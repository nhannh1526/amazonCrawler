I had the 2020 iPad 10.2-inch. So I was expecting a major upgrade over this. It wasn't. It's a downgrade. In fact, it's so questionable I believe Apple outright lied about the 4K video and/or pixels on the camera.

The top and bottom bezels are a little smaller and it's definitely thinner, but I enjoyed the picture quality on the regular iPad more. The thickness of the tablet seemed to give depth to the pictures. I read a lot of online comics, and those comics looked better on the regular iPad than they do the Pro, which was a shock.", "I've never had an iPad air. I skipped it and went straight to this one. I got the 11\" because I'm not very strong and believed the 12.9\" would be too laptop like and heavy. I already have a laptop, so I was going for portability. I do like the 11\"'s thinness, style, and look. It's beautiful, especially when it's in the Smart Folio.", "As for performance, picture, and video quality: The regular 2020 10.2\" iPad is just as good, and I'm not saying that because I have a vendetta against Apple (although I do resent them calling this a \"pro\" anything. Not even close). This tablet is just as good - and bad - as the regular iPad, and they've hiked the price up $400 for no reason. I don't care what they're calling the tech in this iPad.

The camera is the best part especially the front camera with center stage. The display is good with 120Hz refresh rate.

These also get wireless charging by default (like the AirPods Pro), as well as MagSafe charging (something that the AirPods Pro were updated with after these were announced). I am an Apple fan, for sure, and I own all versions of the AirPods that are currently sold as well as the Beats Studio Buds. Some people think that these aren't worth $180 because the Pro model already exists and sells for $180-200 usually, even though the list price is $250.", "These do not have the active noise cancellation feature that the AirPods Pro or Beats Studio Buds have, but I think people are forgetting that some people don't like using earbuds with tips that go into your ear canal. That is one of the the things that made AirPods so popular in the first place, plus the fact that they are made by Apple. There aren't a ton of options for premium, open true wireless earbuds with the universal fit that AirPods offer, they're just not as common as the kind with silicon eartips. And there is no way to use the AirPods Pro without also using the eartip, they won't stay in place like theses 3rd gen AirPods will.", "The bud itself is larger on these compared to the previous model with the longer stems, so these feel a bit different when you put them in your ear. I got used to it pretty quickly and they are really comfortable, they stay in place really well for my ear shape. These have the force squeeze controls that the Pros have and it is so much better to use than the old tap controls. If you haven't used this controls system before, you will most likely enjoy using it more because the bud doesn't get pressed into your ear when you need to pause the music and you get more options for controlling playback.", "The other big upgrade here is the sound quality along with Spatial Audio which works just as well as it does on the AirPods Pro. The sound quality now is pretty much on par with the AirPods Pro, some reviewers have even said it's better. It includes the Adaptive EQ feature where the earbuds are constantly re-adjusting the sound to give you the best quality audio based on your surroundings. There is an internal microphone dedicated just to analyzing the audio to make sure it sounds as good as possible.", "Spatial Audio is kind of hard to explain but I will try my best, instead of having a static left and right channel audio, the audio sounds like it's all around you. For Video, it makes the sound seem like it's coming from where the video is playing (your iPhone or iPad or Apple TV). Think about if you are listening to audio from a speaker that is in front of you, if you turn your head to the left, your right ear is going to be hearing more of the audio because your left ear is now facing away from the speaker. That is what spatial audio is like, using the new AirPods when you watch a video on your iPhone. The AirPods use the sensors(accelerometers and gyroscopes) in the earbuds as well as in your iPhone to calculate the position of your head in reference to the device playing the video. The end result is that the audio sounds like it is in front of you, coming from the device, even though it\u2019s playing through the AirPods. It really is awesome and it's one of my favorite features of these AirPods, the older 2nd generation did not include this feature but the Pro model does. While originally it only worked on iPhone/iPad, it now works on Mac and Apple TV as well.", "The last thing to mention is these AirPods now have better sensors for detecting when they aren't in your ear, even the Pro model doesn't have the new skin detection sensors. This means that if you take out your earbuds and put them in your pocket or a dark place like a drawer, the AirPods will not be fooled and won't accidentally un-pause your music until you put them back in your ear.

It's very hard to get excellent sound quality without a seal in the ear and Apple has figured it out with these AirPods!

These are inherent to bluetooth headphones because there is a DAC/AMP stage in the AirPods Max themselves, but are the reason they cannot be easily compared.", "Overall, if you have the money and value good sound quality, these are an easy buy.

Excellent ANC. Connection from phone to iPad and back is perfect. However there is water buildup after 3-4 hours underneath the earcups - repeatable when just sitting at my desk at 66-70 degrees. Connection to a MacBook Pro and back to phone is just not as seamless, and it gets lost sometimes. I returned them but tested them extensively for 3 weeks, really wanted to keep them but the water flaw is too concerning at this price to risk it.", "Detailed Review:", "I\u2019m going to start with the good:", "- spatial audio is really good. Watching the Mandelorian is great - more for the surround sound experience than the more gimmicky thing with turning your head - which is \u201ccool\u201d but adds little to no value. Whereas surround sound - experiencing noises from different sides really helps with the immersion.", "- sound quality is excellent for Bluetooth headphones. I preferred these instead of the XM4. I am not an audiophile but I like good sound and these seemed more balanced. I have $200 wired seinheiser headphones that I might like a tiny bit better for music for what it\u2019s worth.", "-  construction build quality is definitely a step up from competitors.", "- connecting to iOS devices is excellent and to a MacBook Pro is good - but not great. More on that later.", "- ANC really good equal pretty much to XM4. I think xm4 is slightly better at some things and these are better cancelling other noises. Overall excellent", "- headband / top of head very comfortable. Much more so than the xm4.", "Neutral:", "- lots of people made a big deal about no power off button and talk about it just \u201cdraining battery\u201d unless you put it in the case. I tested this a lot, and it seems Apple is accurate when they say it goes to low power mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. Losing about 1% every couple of hours. Essentially losing 5% when left without a case overnight. I\u2019m talking 5-6pm to 8am. However I had an issue where they wouldn\u2019t turn on (only 1 day) with a full battery. Since there is no power button... I removed them form my ears out then back on, I stuffed them in the \u201csmart case\u201d removed them, nothing. I plugged them to the lightning cable to see if the charge light would turn on, and then they immediately started working (battery read 109%, I only plugged them in for 5 seconds). It only happened one day out of 20... but annoying nonetheless.", "- ear pad material is soft but course so moving it side to side hurts my ears. But leaving then on (normal use case) is comfortable.", "Cons:", "- the \u201ccase\u201d. It has a nice material but it doesn\u2019t provide any protection for them at all. Fairly pointless and you can see all the jokes online about it. I don\u2019t think it looks bad, it\u2019s just pointless without any protection. Going to ultra low power mode a day sooner (it still takes like 15 hours or something, not sure why it\u2019s not instant to that power mode).", "- the price. Just a tad too high to swallow, but I had returned the XM4 for various small annoyances to splurged on this hoping it solved the issues - it mostly does but the last 2 points made me return them:", "- connecting to MacBook Pro and iPhone \u201cautomatic switching\u201d. I was hoping this would be better than the XM4 (which constantly got stuck on the wrong device and had no way other than turning off Bluetooth to send it back to the laptop). It is better, but it\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s perfect between iOS devices - going back and forth from phone to iPad is seamless and pretty amazing - much better than anything out there. However once a MacBook is involved it\u2019s a different deal. There is a little prompt at the top right that shows up that you need to click when switching back and forth, but it no always shows up. Sometimes it does, sometimes it switches automatically and sometimes I need to connect the headphones to the MacBook again. I\u2019m still not sure when it does which of them. However removing them from my ears and putting them back on resets it and I\u2019m connected to the MacBook or the prompt shows up for me to click. Overall I\u2019m not sure why they couldn\u2019t make it as seamless as iOS where just clicking pause on one and play on them other switches the connection immediately: there is no awkward prompt or anything. Overall I was disappointed on the instant switching when involving my MacBook Pro. Still works better than the xm4 and Bose 700 that sometimes gets lost in between with no easy reset.", "Finally why I returned them - you can see the pictures I attached. I wanted these as primary work headphones (conference calls - which they work great, ANC which works great, easy switching which works very good but not great, and for music and movies which they are excellent).", "However the stories online I thought maybe affected few people. The first day I didn\u2019t have any buildup, nor the second or the third.

This is my second 12.9 inch iPad Pro.  The previous one had the same problem.  The USB-C charging port is not sufficiently secure.  It has lateral play that eventually causes an internal connection to break rendering the iPad useless requiring an expensive repair.  The internal connection may be a solder joint or a thin buss on a flexible printed circuit board.  I don\u2019t know the actual design, but some connection will eventually break.  My first iPad was a 3rd generation iPad.  I assumed the lateral play in the USB-C was normal since it was the first iPad Pro to use that type of connector.  After a couple of years, it failed and Apple wanted $700 just to open it to see what was wrong.  Instead of paying for the repair, I purchased an 11-inch iPad Pro.  The cost was about the same.  The 11-inch does not have the lateral play issue.  The USB-C connector is very solid with absolutely no movement.

You need to pair the iPad with an iPhone in order to text Android devices, so if your phone is an Android you are SOL. There is an app available that let's you text android devices, but it assigns a whole different telephone number, so that is very confusing to the person receiving the text. Another weird thing is that the iPad does not have a headphone jack. You have to use Bluetooth ear buds. I have not tried to set up Bluetooth earphones, so I can't comment on how easy, or difficult that may be. For me, this is definitely not ideal. Wireless ear buds need to be constantly charged up, and I find them uncomfortable and they easily get bumped out of my ear.

The Bose also do not get as warm as the Apple.", "TRANSPARENCY MODE", "Transparency mode, in my opinion, is actually more natural on the Bose. The Apple headphones actually amplify the sound around you a few decibles too much. In other words, things sound louder than they actually are with the transparency mode on the AirPods Max.  Also, the Bose reproduces your own voice much more naturally when in transparency mode.", "SOUND QUALITY", "Sound quality at certain volume levels is almost exactly the same. Kind of unbelievable. It is as though Apple reverse engineered the Bose 700 and copied its sound signature and noice canceling to within 5 percent. There is  a definite sound quality difference though that changes with the volume level. This is all about the DSP. Of course, the digital signal processing (DSP) is called Computational Audio on the Max and Volume Optimized EQ on the Bose. This is what works differently and what accounts for sound differences dependent on the volume. Basically, the Bose sound better at 60 percent volume and below. Bose just has it dialed in so that everything sounds rich and balanced. I usually listen to music at about 55 percent volume on my iPad. So, I prefer the sound of the Bose. The sound at 60 percent and below on the AirPods Max suffers from a veiled upper midrange. An alto saxophone, for example, will sound as though it is being played behind a wooden door.", "Now between 60 and 70 percent volume is where both headphones sound virtually the same. It is uncanny! Both sound absolutely wonderful. Probably the best you will ever hear on wireless noise canceling headphones (yes, the Sony has an amplified and unnatural mid-bass making them sound deep but not high fidelity).", "At 70 percent volume and above the Bose DSP begins to lower the bass response to avoid distortion. The bass gets progressively quieter as you increase on the Bose to where there is virtually no bass at about 90 percent volume.  The AirPods Max, on the other hand, handle bass very nicely from 70 all the way up to 100 percent. In fact, they sound perfectly balanced all the way from 60 to 100 percent volume with no sound quality degradation. If there is a fault it is that the bass looses a little nuance. In other words at high volumes the bass is a little over controlled.  The softer vibrations like on the trail of a bass string get lost a little.", "So to summaries the sound comparisons.  The two headphones sound equal from 60 to 70 percent volume. The Bose sound bette at 60 percent volume and below. Finally, the AirPods sound better (by quite a bit, it\u2019s not even close) at 70 percent volume and above.", "CONTROLS", "The final comparison are the controls. Apple wins in my book.  The Digital Crown has a perfect feel to it. It rotates very smoothly with a perfect amount of resistance. It presses well also. Apple has hyper dialed-in these controls. It makes me never want to have to use the touch-pad on the Bose 700 ever again.", "WHICH ONE IS FOR ME?", "Everything is comparable on these two headphones, but in the end, sound quality at my preferred listening level wins out. Since I listen to at about 50 percent volume, the Bose continue to be he choice for me. I just have a fixed routine for when I use noise canceling headphones.", "Now, I am sure that Apple could probably update their firmware to adjust the computational audio in order to fix the balance issues below 60 percent volume. If they did, then the fit and finish and controls might win me back over to the AirPods Max.  But, the slight compromise in long-term comfort would cause me to hesitate a little.", "ONE LAST THING", "One last thing, the spatial audio is pretty Amazing. If I had to watch movies on my iPad these headphones would be a must. The surround sound effects are as good (slightly better) than my Bose home theatre system. The overall sound quality for movies is slightly less (more sterile and hollow sounding, probably because of the limited Bluetooth codec) than my Bose home theatre system.\n"]},

Reviewers say they're excellent and have the best ANC/transparency mode out there, and they damn well better for $550. So are they all they're hyped up to be? Is Apple taking the audio world by storm and revolutionizing music as we know it? No. Not by a long shot.", "I'll try to categorize and simplify my thoughts:", "-Build Quality:", "  In classic Apple fashion, the hardware is very good. Metal and high quality fabrics are present, no Apple logos or graphics to stain the clean and sleek design, and the magnetic replaceable earcups are genius (albeit expensive at $69 a pair).", "-Controls", "  The button/knob wheel combo is simple yet effective. I much prefer physical buttons to touch controls (The Sony WH-1000XM3's have infuriating touch controls and apparently the M4's aren't much better) and Apple does it right. One button to switch between ANC/transparency mode and no mode at all, and the knob to control the volume as well as play and pause. Super simple, as it should be. However, I couldn't help but notice how little resistance the buttons have, which makes them easy to press. This resulted in me accidentally pressing something almost every time I put on/took off/adjusted my headphones if I grabbed them from the top. Just something to note.", "-ANC/Transparency Mode:", "  Transparency mode on these is EXCELLENT. Voices almost sound like they're in your head and everything is made not only louder, but clearer as well. Much better than the Airpod Pros. The ANC however, to me was a bit of a let down. It was difficult finding the different between ANC and no mode at all, but I suspect this might have something to do with....", "-The Fit", "  I have a big problem with the fit. It's a little hard to explain in text but I'll give it a shot. Ideally, when the headphones are put on, the main cans sit flat on your ears and are parallel to each other to create a nice seal around your ear, like this  {|  |}  . But due to the hinge design that connects the main cans to the headband, they have too much area to move around in a sense, and they end up fitting more like this  {/  \\}  , which results in too much pressure being applied at the top of the main cup and not enough at the button, creating an opening at the button of my ear where not only the music escapes through, but outside noise bleeds in as well. I have tried every length and adjusted them in every way possible but that is an unavoidable flaw in the design. Could it be due to my weird head shape? Possibly, but it's not something I've never experienced in over-ear headphones, so I'm blaming Apple for this one.", "-Sound", "  So they don't fit well and ANC is balls. Could the sound save it perhaps? Will you weep in joy at the Apple engineering that made such beautiful vocals and trembling bass possible? No. I would call it average. SLIGHTLY better than the Airpod Pros. My V-Moda M-100's, almost a decade old, sh!t on these, spit in their face, curb stomp them, pick them up, then sh!t on them once more, all at half the price (and they straight KILL them once I connect them to my FiiO BTR5) all at half the price or so. Sound is okay, bass is lacking for me, volume is shockingly low. Just an overall disappointment.", "Final Verdict:", "  These aren't bad headphones at all, not by any means. Great build quality, banging transparency mode, and average sound. But for five hundred and FIFTY DOLLARS it should be FANTASTIC sound, with SILENT ANC, and more accessories than a single cable and a DIAPER for a case (which is frankly pathetic). There is much better out there for cheaper. I personally recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4's (I actually have the M3's but they're apparently really similar to the M4's so not enough for me to upgrade but great deal for first time buyers). Great sound, great ANC, great fit, comfortable, wonky controls but not a dealbreaker, with actual useful accessories and a proper carrying case at half the price. Or V-Modas. Or Sennheisers. Or Airpod Pros. Anything within the $200-$300 range really will do anything these do and most likely better. I generally like Apple products and can justify owning my Airpods (both regular and Pros), iPad, and even the Watch, as they offer an experience I just can't quite get with other products, through the hardware and software, but these are a giant swing and a miss, and I will be returning them within the week. I am not rating it 2 stars because they're bad. I am rating it as such for the incredibly bad value for money you're getting.\n"]},

They stay put. One has fallen out two times total, and one of those times I knocked it out by accidentally hitting the stem while reaching up.  The sound is really good. These come with the sound feature that makes the sound seem directional. In other words, for the first couple days, I kept pulling them out to make sure they were working because the sound from the earbuds seemed like it was coming from my phone. It makes the viewing experience seem more natural. These are not the noise cancelling kind. I can still hear what\u2019s going on around me, which is how I want it. I can hear if someone needs to talk to me without anyone having to yell. I can hear my environment well enough to be safe, but not so it ruins my listening experience. The sound is crisp and clear. They\u2019re rated to last 4 hours before needing to be recharged, but I\u2019ve gone a little longer. They seem to peter  out one at a time, so you can actually charge the dead one and continue using the other one and then switch when the second one goes. This has been helpful for marathon phone conversations. I don\u2019t think this works for listening to content because pulling out one earbud causes the content to pause - another cool feature since you don\u2019t have to find the pause button when you need to stop for a minute. It automatically stops for you and picks right back up when you put the earbud back in. Do you can accomplish the pause by pulling out just one bud. You can always squeeze the post to pause as well. They charge up quickly in the case. The case charges quickly as well (and lasts at least 30 hours between charges).  I bought a silicone case for mine and they still charge easily on the charging mat. They can also charge using a regular lightning cord. I\u2019ve done both with no problem. They do work with you Find My app, but I think it\u2019s just the case that it finds. This is a problem if you\u2019re bad about taking them out of your ears and just leaving them around the house. No handy ping for that. I\u2019ve dropped mine a few times. They seem pretty sturdy - no cracks or other damage.  I love that my jack is now free so I can charge and listen at the same time.

I use them in the cockpit of a small plane, which is one thing Apple is now marketing the Mini 6 for. But I also use it for general tablet stuff; web browsing, watching YouTube, listening to music. I upgraded from the 5 to the 6 specifically for Pencil 2 support. The Mini 5 supports the first-gen Pencil, and while that was great as a first step towards going paperless in the cockpit for me, the way the Pencil 1 charges is just really an inconvenience for my use. I'd constantly get in the plane only to realize my Pencil is dead, and I'd have to just go back to paper anyway. I ended up just always carrying paper and a pen on me anyway, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the Pencil. So being able to have the Pencil 2 constantly stuck to the iPad and charging magnetically was enough in itself to get me to upgrade.", "You'd normally expect that any upgraded tech device would have all the stuff you liked about the prior model, but just with more power, features and/or a more elegant design. In the case of the Mini 6, though, I feel like it may be one step forward, two steps back. I'm really happy with the Pencil 2 support but not really with anything else. I may actually be returning it; I'll update this review if I do.", "First, jelly scroll is real. I'm always skeptical of complaints like this. They often start with one person who's either overly nitpicky or who just got a defective unit, and then they snowball as others with the same defect or a severe case of OCD write internet comments in agreement. But I was honestly shocked when I turned on my Mini 6, went to a random web page in Chrome, scrolled and saw the effect. It was much worse than I expected, and easily noticeable. It is difficult to believe this got past Apple's quality control.", "In reading some other articles about this, it seems clear that Apple's not really lying when they say this is \"normal LCD behavior\", but the problem is that they've mounted the screen controller in the Mini 6 sideways. If you look at the Mini 5, and pretty much any other tablet, you do see some jelly scrolling in landscape orientation, but not in portrait orientation. The Mini 6 is the opposite; it jelly scrolls in portrait but not in landscape. So it is, oddly, a landscape tablet. The weird thing about it, though, is that the controls are not really set up for that orientation, and I sure don't normally use it that way. It's not an efficient way to read web pages; the only thing it's good for is watching videos, where jelly scrolling isn't an issue regardless of how the screen controller's mounted.", "The screen is also slightly taller (or you could say \"wider\" if you consider it a landscape tablet), and that doesn't work well in portrait mode either. My Mini 5 shows 6 icons across and they are nicely spaced. The Mini 6, using the same settings (smaller icons), shows 5 icons across and they are weirdly bunched up in the middle. This could be fixed with an OS update but I'd never buy any product based on the promise of a future update. Also, it again is just a weird design decision from a company that's supposed to be all about design.", "I compared the screen brightness of the two tablets as well and while they're close, the Mini 5 is very slightly brighter. Again, I made sure they had the same settings - max brightness, Night Shift off, and True Tone both on and off. The Mini 5 screen always wins by a hair.", "Add to all that the removal of the headphone jack and I'd say that if you don't need Pencil 2 support, keep your Mini 5 or buy a refurbished one if you're in the market for your first Mini. Save yourself some money too. This was just not a very good update to the Mini line.", "Personally, I just need to decide if the Pencil 2 support is enough to overcome all of the Mini 6's downsides. My only viable alternative if I do want the Pencil 2 is the iPad Air, which is $100 more expensive and bigger/heavier... not necessarily an asset in a small plane carrying two people. The iPad Pro also supports the Pencil 2 but it is larger still and even more expensive. It's a tough call for me, but I'd definitely say that most people should get either a Mini 5 (if you don't need the Pencil 2) or an Air (if you want the Pencil 2 and have the space for a larger tablet).\n"]},

Sony is plastic, Apple is metal and fiber and the Momentum is metal and real leather on the ear pads and headband. Apple Earphones are new age sexy, Sennheiser Momentum 300 are retro cool and Sony let\u2019s call modern but plain. Price wise Sony is no higher than $348, Sennheiser is available for $330 down from $400 at introduction in 2019 or so and Apple is $550.", "Apple does Apple and I have discovered first hand how brutal they are about forcing you to do what they want. If you try to do anything other than pair them with your iPhone or iPad you will meet roadblocks. They only offer music at 48 kilobits per second so that is all they allow you to listen to in their headphones. If you try to hook up to a device with a higher bit rate it will be reduced before it passes through to your headphones. You can theoretically pay $35 for a special little wire that allows you to connect to a device that would otherwise allow you to plug into a receiver. You can only get it from Apple and even then the 3.5 mmonnection won\u2019t fit into receivers because they take a larger jack which is 6.35.", " So while they sell adapters that will fit the bill they aren\u2019t Apple approved. In short they don\u2019t just want you to buy and use all their equipment. They force you to use their other products to use the headphones successfully. The weight of the Air Pods Max coupled with what they call clamping force makes them very uncomfortable to wear and don\u2019t even think about exercising or running in them. They will bounce around as you move and I began to feel strain and stress from the fit within ten minutes. Sure, I bought them to entertain myself on long walks but I don\u2019t know where I would put them for the walk home when they are too heavy to wear. You cannot hang them around your neck without choking yourself and then there is the bra/purse like carrier if you was to carry that. Won\u2019t fold in on itself like many of most headphones.", "No matter how sexy it looks or how cool it makes you feel to be envied for your coolness the grimace on your face after an hour with these on your head will not attract anyone. I really wanted these as I was telling myself they must have the best sound quality and that is what I am all about. Still  if I don\u2019t like wearing them the music doesn\u2019t help much and I am left with hoping a really cool person or persons will see that I am cool also. I don\u2019t hate Apple and I have an IPhone 10max and an iPad(I bought my first one in April 2010 when the first one was introduced and was the very first truly friendly computer like device) and a MacBook Pro which I won\u2019t replace.", "With these headphones they have gone too far with the silly and unnecessary allegiance to Apple required to use it easily. You can search for hours online to find workarounds but half or more of what people suggest doesn\u2019t work. Meanwhile Apple knows all of this and basically gives us the old high hat if we are willing to buy products that compel us to buy only their other products to make them work. Connecting instantly to my iPhone when picked up or put on rather than having to use a typical Bluetooth prompt to accept a connection is not worth enslaving myself just to show aluminum on my ears.", " I am boxing these up even though they arrived earlier today. I bought them from Amazon because of their stellar return policy and I recommend you do the same if you want to try these. If I kept them I would be doing what many who read my review will do and that is defend and rationalize my choice. That is what human beings do. So if Apple product allegiances are important to you after spending this amount of money on top of all the other products you have bought from them feel free to put it on blast. I know this is a lot of money to spend for many if not most people and I wanted to write something for folks who haven\u2019t had time to do a lot of research and are at a decision point.", "I am torn between the Sony XM4(leaving me light headed and looking average) and the Sennheiser Momentum 300(xciting to listen to but making me look my retro like my age). If you want to check out online reviews you will find that deciding who to listen to and trust is every bit as difficult as making your headphone choice. I don\u2019t know who receives what in the way of free products to use or resell or even monetary compensation which might disappear with too much honesty. All I can do is tell you what I think and let you take it into consideration if helpful.", "I don\u2019t care about corporations especially large ones as they take care of themselves just fine. I have learned", "that there are people who are loyal to and defend corporations and don\u2019t like others criticizing them or their products. In my own life I find that my weakest point is often my best point pushed too far. I think the exuberance for these Air Max headphones and Apples marketing games has likely reached that place with these headphones. Who knows? Maybe I will update my review once I try the Sony or the Sennheiser or both. For now I will be happy to merely take a heavy load off my head!\n"]},

Well, if there's more than one way to say it correctly, Apple should consider spending more time developing software instead of boasting high end hardware, which is not so high end if it can't manage memory with many apps open. And it does not. Without an option to close all apps at once? Apple responds with BS. Forcing me to swipe multiple fingers for a few to close is all. I've had memory filled with all the apps I use.

I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.", "7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.", "It has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun. Lots of other things. The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it's unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were.\n"]},

This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.", "My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.", "A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop \"umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store\". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.", "Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.", "Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect.

This was supposed to be an upgrade from my 2014 MacBook Air. I previously had a 2020 16\" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13\" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop. No blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work. I am floored that Apple would produce a Pro for business that only supports a single monitor. I love Apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out.\n"]},

If you've never had noise canceling earbuds, the sensation is very weird when you put them on as it goes really quiet out of no where.

Yes, the case is ridiculous. I purchased a more viable case for. It does not come with a charging adapter (brick). That was a not a real issue for me.

As an artist and writer, and I also love to read history books, I knew this little thing would be a great companion alongside my Pro. I heard of the jellyscroll problems but still decided to get it, and in my general opinion, it is really up to you as the buyer to decide is the jellyscoll problem is a big issue. Yes, it is there, and I notice it, but it does not bother me one bit. It's only really noticeable when YOU decide to take the time to notice it. Everyone has their own views on how much it bothers them, and with me, it does not. I would recommend stopping at an Apple Store (if you have one near) or a store like Best Buy to see it first hand and test out the screen to see if it is a reason for you to get it or not. I don't think this should be any reason for someone to not get it or even return it like some people have. Despite the flaw, it is still a cute little thing to have with me, and would make a great companion for you for your own needs. Don't let jellyscroll prevent you from getting it. And if you truly don't like it, then you have the choice to return it. But for me, its great, and pretty much exactly what I wanted\n"]},

{"profile-name": "WheezingLamb", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  This new iPad Air, on the surface, isn't anything groundbreaking. It's a bit faster, a bit thinner, a bit lighter, and a bit shinier than all the tablets I've used before. But, taken altogether--and taken along with the second-gen Apple Pencil--it feels like an entirely new experience. I haven't been this struck by a new device in a while.", "Over the years, I've owned three or four iPads, a few Android tablets, and a few convertible touchscreen laptops running various OSes. I've always been partial to Samsung because of the S Pen, and I've owned a couple of Galaxy Tabs and the Chromebook Pro: I love taking handwritten notes during meetings, and I like writing my first drafts by hand.", "But this device, with the Pencil, is leaps and bounds better than any other tablet I've used. Writing and drawing on it feels completely intuitive and fluid. The responsiveness of the interface with the pencil is amazing--it reproduces my handwriting (chicken scratch that it is) perfectly. And more than that, the built-in handwriting recognition in the OS is frankly astounding. Either using the Scribble feature to handwrite form entries or using the Notes app's feature that lets you search your handwritten notes, everything works FAR better than I expected them to. Let me reiterate: my handwriting is atrocious. And yet, this iPad is able to decipher my hieroglyphics with a frequency that actually makes the feature really useful--I was expecting it to be little more than a gimmick, as in the past handwriting recognition apps have been completely useless for me. There've been a few times where I actually giggled out loud when the iPad recognized something I'd written that I could barely read myself.", "Outside of how perfectly the iPad, iPadOS14, and Pencil have all integrated into my workflow, the design of the device itself is very nice, and the build quality is excellent. The tablet feels oddly light while still feeling very sturdy. And it's thin--even Apple's marketing images really don't do it justice. And obviously the new processor is nice, though I won't pretend to have done enough to even come close to pushing its limits. But the entire experience has been very smooth, even playing around with video editing and trying to find the most graphically-intensive games on the App Store I could. Haven't seen any lag or stuttering at all.", "All that said, it's not perfect. I do wish Apple was finally putting OLEDs into more of their devices outside of the iPhone. The screen on this really is gorgeous, don't get me wrong. And the blacks aren't awful or anything. But given how great everything else is on this device, having a backlit screen--as advanced and pretty as it is--just feels weird. And I'm kind of ambivalent about the power button TouchID. Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled the Home button is gone, but I think I'd kinda prefer FaceID. The TouchID on this iPad works great, and it does work very quickly, but I'm spoiled by being used to just tapping the screen on my iPhone and having it unlock itself automatically.", "Anyway, those minor gripes aside, this is a great little device, it fit itself into my workflow immediately. I think the highest praise I can give it is that it's amazing how quickly it effectively disappeared: within a couple days of using it, I stopped noticing it, because everything about writing and taking notes with the iPad and the Pencil felt second nature, it felt like it had always been there. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.\n"]},

I really love going through social media watching YouTube videos and texting, I\u2019m texting way more than I did in the past 5 years and the onscreen keyboard is so great to use. One thing I do want to complain about is that the blue light that this tablet outputs must be very high because the day I started using this tablet I found it way harder to fall asleep. Be sure to turn on Night Shift to get some good hours of Zzzz.

I used to have issues with my S4 connecting to my speakers and issues connecting to my WiFi router with my laptops and it makes me very happy to see that so far I haven\u2019t had any issues with this tablet.", "Overall?", "This a buy for me. If you need a full laptop replacement to do crazy 4K video editing and got cash to throw around, get the Apple iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 4th generation) but if you want to get more bang for your buck and are mainly going to be using this as a tablet and doing basic college work mainly using Google Docs, heavy gaming or heavy media consumption then this tablet is more than enough. I got $50 off during Black Friday and I consider that a crazy good deal. I don\u2019t regret buying this tablet. In my opinion this is far greater tablet/laptop than the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ especially if you have an iPhone because you will not be able to send text messages from any Samsung tablet if you currently use an iPhone. So far, I\u2019m very happy with my purchase and I\u2019m sure you will be too!!!\n"]},

Well, I am sorry I did & HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you don't & stick to the Apple Airpods 2 version, instead.  The sound is well, without much base.  I mean R&B and Hip-Hop / Rap or House Music should have BASS.  Trust me, these Pro version DO NOT - it's more like high treble.  The biggest complaint is when it comes to changing songs.  On the Airpods 2 I used to be able to tap on the ear bud twice & change songs.  Now, on Airpods Pro I must squeeze (twice) to change a song - REALLY TIM COOK???  Anyways, because of the shortened stem on the Pro version, it's difficult to grab the stem & squeezing it twice DOES NOT WORK!!!  I've read the literature & you must be VERY PRECISE in order for this feature to work.  Anyways, I have inadvertently pulled out the earbuds many times trying this & when you are running or cycling it makes it difficult as you have to stop & go retrieve your fallen Airpods Pro.  Also, on the Airpoods 1 & 2 I used to have a thin silicone lanyard around my neck & on the stem to hold them in place just in case I sweat too much or accidently hit them & they fell out.  Well with the Pro version YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!!!.  Thanks for screwing a great feature set APPLE & Tim Cook.  Yet, again, the design engineers & Tim Cook have disappointed an end user.  So, while cycling today, 6 days after I got my first & LAST Pro set, one of the buds fell out while trying to SQUEEZE the stem to change songs as lifting your Apple Watch is not always conducive while cycling.  I had to try to squeeze multiple times.  In doing so, my right ear bud fell out & it went right into the street grate & now LOST forever - THANKS TIM COOK!!  I now have a useless Apple Airpods Pro set.  So much for stereo.  Anyways, do yourself ALL a favor - stay with the 2 - the sound is TRULY BETTER than the Airpods Pro.\n"]},

At the shop, they were much more responsive but warned that a small crack in the bottom of the screen that happened when I close it one day likely caused the problem, would not be covered by the warranty and would cost $700 to fix.

I switched, primarily, because of the 120Hz refresh rate screen, which Apple took a little too long to implement. Many people say they can't notice a difference, but for me it is absolutely night and day. 120Hz makes 60Hz nearly unusable. In this regard, while it did take Apple a while to implement it in their phones, the implementation has been great and the 120Hz on the iPhone Pro models is well worth it.", "Display Features: The notch. Goodness let's please get rid of the notch already. It's 2021. The iPhone STILL has the notch up top, and no matter how many times people say \"it disappears when you use the phone\", no it does not. The notch is annoying, plain and simple. And while it is a little more narrow, it is now just a bit taller. The iPhone also still does not have under-display touch ID, which is another frustrating feature that has been on Android phones for some time and really needs to make its way to the iPhone. The facial recognition does seem great, which is a good feature to have.", "Camera: I have really been impressed with the camera so far. I'm not a big enough camera snob to really tell you that one phone is objectively better than the other, unless we are comparing phones 3 or 4 gens apart, but I can say that I am very pleased with the camera on the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Edge detection on portrait mode CAN be a little tricky at times with closely competing colors, but overall I still feel it's very good.", "iOS 15: At the time of my purchase, iOS 15 was already available and I immediately switched over. Having already been on the Samsung train when iOS 14 was in use, I cannot give much of a review on them compared. Overall, I preferred my OS setup on my Samsung phone. It is much cleaner and easier to navigate, especially when using 3rd party launchers. I could just swipe up from the bottom and Android would list all of my available apps in alphabetical order with some favorites I picked on the home screen. As many as I wanted. iOS is a little clunkier, with all apps existing on the home screen and the overflow screens. Sure, you can order them however you'd like, but if you have a ton of apps, it's always nicer with an automatically sorted list. Setting notifications is also clunky and it can be a chore to toggle those you need to see and those you don't. A lot of one-by-one. As someone who doesn't want a ton of push notifications, going in and having to turn all those I want off instead of just those I want on is troublesome.", "Performance & Battery: Overall, the performance on the iPhone seems equal to or greater than my Samsung. I believe the iPhone 13 Pro Max is powered by 6GB of RAM, compared to my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, which had 16GB of RAM, the performance of the two is very similar. Something to be said for app optimization. Where I have had issues in the past with Apple iPhones is when they approach the 2-year mark, the battery health starts to really deteriorate. I did not have this issue with my Samsung. However, the battery life on the Pro Max is insanely long and if it stays relatively healthy throughout the time I have it, I will definitely be more than pleased.", "Support: One thing that really sets Apple apart is support. They are pushing iOS 15 to the iPhone 6S, which came out in 2015. Android just simply doesn't do that. Support disappears after 2-3 years, at least in my experience. This is a huge bummer when you consider the cost of flagship devices to the consumer, and Android REALLY falls behind in this regard. If you consider a possible 6 year support cycle for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, you're looking at a phone you could possible have until 2027. That's definitely something to keep in mind.", "Overall: Functionally, I think the iPhone is still a little clunky and dated, but it's an OS that works and people know. The ecosystem is tough to beat, and with so many people have iPhones, sending videos and pictures through text without them being unbelievably downsampled is a huge plus. Apple is still behind in some of the features you can get on Android devices, but they always say they may not necessarily be first, but they always implement the features well, and I can't argue with that here. It's a solid flagship device that has potential to last you half a decade or more. You won't be disappointed.\n"]},

I like the color alright but I always use Apple leather cases on my iPhones and those colors released do not quite go with the Sierra Blue phone. I ended up getting purple and it is not quite a match. Apple should have released the Blue Jay color in leather as well. For me the Pro Max phones are hard to handle without a case and there are no better ones than Apple leather cases. The new phone slips out of your hands easier than the 11 pro max, which was much easier to hold with the case than this.", "The audio quality improvements (increased clarity and fidelity) are great on the 13 pro max and you can see that in the speaker mode as well. That alone can justify the upgrade for me but for some minor setbacks, more on that later. While at home I use Wi-Fi calling and it is super clear, better than the previous phone. The 120 hz refresh rate that auto adjusts based on the need for it is a welcome addition. Scrolling looks great and so does video playback. Although I do not play video games on iPhones, it can be a game changer for those who do. The other major improvement is the speed of processing with the improved processor, you can see the iOS completing tasks faster.", "I liked my old Apple 11 Pro Max, but needed a phone with 256 GB as 64 GB on the 11 pro was too small and the carrier ran out of other sizes at the time I got it. The storage capacity offerings that Apple released the new one with can be very important for some consumers and I am really happy with the 256 GB. I have a big Spotify library, a photo library of my family and extended family as well. Whatsapp takes quite a bit too and I already filled almost half the storage.", "Battery improvements over the 11 pro max are small and really should not play a part in your decision to upgrade, if you are upgrading from a 12 pro max it is a significant difference. The 13 Pro Max has a good camera package and that alone can be worth upgrading for folks who need it, but for me the quality of the pictures and videos with the old phone were just fine for casual use for most occasions. I have good Nikon equipment for serious pictures and a good camcorder. Apple\u2019s ios15 privacy protections can be used on the older phones too, but on this device the new processor and 5G can make a difference in speed with VPN and private relay feature for iCloud.", "Negatives:", "I use a lot of apps: financial, grocery, shopping, sports, news, Spotify, podcasts and travel. Most of the apps show really small font in large areas of the screen. There are no settings I know of to fix that, this happened with the new phone and iOS 15. I did not have this issue with the older phone and previous iOS. The settings do not change the font size in the apps entirely, meaning it leaves certain important portions of the screen unchanged (you can increase the text size in iOS settings and add the text size feature in the control center and try what works best for you). For example, on the Amazon app, while writing this review, the font couldn\u2019t be increased no matter how big I go, it just increases in some areas, same case with my other shopping apps. This is likely not Apple\u2019s fault but the Apps are to blame. However, that small font shouldn\u2019t have been allowed by Apple.", "While away from home and not connected to Wi-Fi I have had choppy phone calls for which the carrier recommends turning off Wi-Fi calling as 5G or even 4G should provide good quality. This setting change is a hassle as I like using it while at home. I will need to observe this more.", "The 13 pro max is also harder to handle even with the leather case comparatively and you can easily feel it is quite a bit heavier. It is impossible to handle it in your hands without a case as it is very slippery and heavy. You almost always have to use two hands, as the 6.7 inch phone with a rather large bezel is too big for most. If you are not already using a holder in your car for your mobile phone, you have to now. I would rather have the old size because of the weight issue, but all the improvements need that extra space and mass. Also this one slipped out of my pocket while sitting in the car seat a few times already while the old one rarely did. Another issue I noticed several times is that safari freezes up on me on the new one, likely iOS 15 bugs. The bugs are likely temporary unless there are hardware problems that cannot be corrected with software updates. The smaller notch is slightly better but still a negative as it looks weird along with a big bezel, which is pretty un-Apple-like.", "Summary:", "All in all the upgrade is worth it for me but really the new one is not quite necessary if you are a light user and have iPhone 11 or 12 for most use cases, nevertheless it is worth considering it as you may discover an important feature you would rather have. Please try it at a store before buying it, you may be impressed with the improvements. The smaller 13 pro and 13 versions of the device are pretty good too. If you are happy with the 6.1 inch size, the 13 pro may be perfect as weight and handling won\u2019t bother you. I have also seen the 13 and it is very light to hold, but it does not have the same camera package, but it can be a perfect choice depending on your preferences, it won\u2019t slip out of your hands nor pockets.", "Recommended accessories you can get on Amazon:", "Spigen glass screen protector, Apple leather case, Apple 20 watt fast charger USB C type, cradle type car holder mounted on air vents (I use Mongoora brand).", "I took the Apple survey but it does not let you leave comments, so I came here to post this review.\n"]},

I listen to music most of the day and I am accustomed to some rather large antique speakers which have a big sound (esp. bass), so these were slightly disappointing at first. You must make sure that you have a good fit with your ear for the optimum experience. The noise canceling is very good as is the transparent mode which allows the world to rush back in. I often stream TV content on my old iMac, so they will come in handy for that and when I travel. Will I use them every day -- probably not, but I think I am probably the exception here. I do not spend large amounts of time on the phone. Will these replace large speakers of a top notch sound system -- no, and I find I miss the ambient sound -- but the sound is very good. I do like to game a bit on the iPad, but the iPad pro has such good sound to begin with, I didn't find that they enhanced my game experience that much but my experience is hardly conclusive. The auto-recognition (when you have them in your ears) did not work for me several times -- I may have put them in backwards because they felt better that way, but the feature where Siri can announce your calls, etc. is nice. You can turn it off if you want a more immersive experience. I doubt I will use the haptic feature much - to be honest these things are pretty small and I would rather just change the settings on my device.\n"]},

I order two of these while they were on sale during Black Friday, and BOTH of the AirPods had defects. One had a faulty case which would not pair with the phone or any apple device. The other had a bad in-ear sensor (which is required if you ever want to turn on noise cancellation). I called Amazon to ask for a replacement and received the run around and was being transferred between agents like a ping pong each one asking me the same information again and again, fed up with this I asked to talk to a manager and was transferred to another agent posing as a manager, and I only found out after I was transferred again to yet another agent who said that they cannot offer me a replacement and only a refund. What will I do with a refund now that all the Black Friday deals on AirPods are over. Either One buy the AirPods at full price $90 more than I initially bought them for or wait until next year. I have had great experiences with Amazon in the past but this incident has forced me to cancel my membership and never use Amazon again.

Now let\u2019s talk about the product itself, i was nervous reading the reviews saying it came damaged or used etc.. i did a comparison between my brother\u2019s Airpods pro from apple store 249$ Vs these mysterious (apple Airpods pro 159$) they both looked exactly the same i was surprised apple assembled them in Vietnam but after all both of our Airpods pro are 100% no difference. I wanna mention battery life and sound cancellation, holy cow i love them so much and they last exactly how they\u2019re described on Amazon! 4h plus on full charged, and the case can charges up to 24h.

I barely feel them in my ears - they just feel light and airy. The music sounds so clear and crisp and warm. I had been using Sony wireless WI-1000X prior to switching to these AirPods. I love Sony for the deep bass but those particular headphones really didn\u2019t work well for conversation and also when it\u2019s hot out, the battery part you wear around your neck just gets clammy and uncomfortable, so I was ready for less physically intrusive headphones. Initially I was wary of the AirPod design (how the heck do they stay in your ears?!) but now that I\u2019m wearing them for the first time I\u2019m sold on this design. Also they paired so quickly and easily with my iPhone straight out of the box. I\u2019ve been using noise cancelling headphones for over 20 years and personally I wouldn\u2019t bother with any headphones that didn\u2019t have that feature. It really makes a huge difference in clarity and what you can actually hear in loud environments. Even something as simple as a dentist visit - when they\u2019re drilling or cleaning - you can actually hear your music or podcast. And if you\u2019re on public transport or a train or plane you can actually hear whatever you\u2019re listening to well without having to crank up volume.

The sound of these AirPods is absolutely AMAZING, and the noise cancelation feature is superb. However, none of that matters because they keep falling out of my ears. They come with 3 sizes of cushions, and shipped with large ones on the device, and they are very easy to change out. I tried the medium and the small cushions, but each size falls out of my ears while working out, which is so annoying because I have to keep reaching up to push them in. I was just walking in the grocery store and the one it had in fell out of my ear, I tried to catch it before it hit the floor but wasn't quick enough. There was no way I was going to put it back in my ear until I cleaned it with a disinfectant wipe. So I ended up walking around with an amazing and expensive device meant for my ears in my pocket. Stop moving around you say?.. Well, I was just sitting at my desk eating and suddenly, plop, it just fell out.  It's not the size because I have other earplug devises the stay in my ears perfectly even when I sweat while working out. Oh, the do come with a charging table but not the block, and the battery life is average. So I have to give Apple a thumbs down on this one, because they don't work.

{"profile-name": "Ian", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I am writing this review focused primarily on people who are considering jumping from the 13\" MacBook Pro to the 14\" MacBook Pro, which is what I did. I moved from the 13\" MacBook Pro M1 with 16gb of RAM to the 14\" MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 16gb of RAM.", "Size: So, 1\" of screen might not seem like a lot on its face, but the difference is pretty substantial, in my opinion. Even the pictures don't quite do it justice. The screen feels considerably larger in a package that isn't considerably larger. For me, it's the perfect sweet spot for someone who wants something larger than the 13\" model, but smaller than the 16\". I had a 16\" MacBook Pro i9 and it was just too much for me. This one feels perfect.", "Form Factor: The new 14\" and 16\" MacBooks both adopt a thicker chassis, which is shown in the pictures. As such, Apple decided to make the casing flat instead of gently rounded. It honestly reminds me of the pre-unibody builds, but still sleek and modern. If I didn't know this one was new and you just laid them side-by-side, I might say that the old form factor looks a little newer, but that isn't to say that it looks bad.", "Aesthetics: Overall, I touched on the aesthetics a bit in the \"form factor\" section. It looks like a high-end laptop, but at the same time I can see some people thinking it looks dated. I personally like the flatter look over the more rounded look, but it will depend on the person. Another thing I like is moving the \"MacBook Pro\" branding from under the screen to the bottom of the casing. I just think it provides a cleaner look during use. The black background of the keyboard is also a plus for me. The old space gray background was fine, but I really like the black.", "Function: Most people probably won't notice a massive difference in the previous iteration and the new iteration. For the 14\" and 16\" MacBook Pros, the touchbar has been removed. This will make a lot of people happy. For me, I was always pretty ambivalent about the touchbar, but I'm not going to complain about a key row there. The keyboard appears to have ever so slightly more travel and bounce. It's not a huge amount, but it is noticeable. I'll touch on The Notch later.", "Performance: My 13\" had the M1 chip and now my 14\" as the M1 Pro. So far, I haven't noticed a tremendous difference when using programs like Logic Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, but I wouldn't say those are super intensive programs. If you're exporting massive 8K videos, you might want to jump up to the M1 Max. One thing I have noticed is that the thermals are maybe a little bit worse. Just a touch. I have noticed it warming up a bit, but the fan still has not come on once. I only mention this because my 13\" M1 stayed cold at all times. It's not as bad as my i9, which sounded like a jet engine revving up while it jumped well over 100 degrees, but it's something to be aware of.", "The Notch: Honestly, so much has been made of the notch and I think it's mostly overstated. Yes, it's fun to meme the fact that Apple still hasn't found a way around the notch, particularly on iPhones, but it's really not a huge deal. Were it up to me, I would have just left a bezel up there, but I can understand why Apple didn't. I use a Dell XPS for work and it has razor thin bezels with no notch, but at the same time the camera is an absolute joke. Looks like it's from 2002.", "The Notch (cont'd): The notch behavior can be inconsistent from app to app, but not to the point where it's bothersome. I have seen some programs with very large nav menus up top bump the status bar out of the way to make room. And while this particular phenomenon is not something new for MacBooks, losing a big chunk of that bar to the notch will likely make this a more regular occurrence for people. Do I wish it didn't have a notch? Yeah, probably. Does it hurt the experience? Very, very little.", "Screen: For everyday indoor use, which is almost exclusively what I do, I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on the market. The 120Hz refresh rate is something I waited a long time to get on the iPhone, so I was pretty shocked to see it implemented on the new MacBook Pros just a month later. It actually has more pixels/inch than the iMac 27\" 5K screen, which I also use pretty regularly. All-in-all, the screen is just the best in the business.", "Overall: It's a great and powerful laptop for someone who is wanting a little more than web surfing and word processing. I use mine primarily for recording music, as well as live performances using standalone plugins, so I need something that is powerful and easy to use. The MacBook Pro has always fit the bill, but now with the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max chips, I have absolutely no concern for performance or consistency.", "My 13\" M1 did just what I needed in this regard, but I'm someone who wanted a slightly larger screen without drastically increasing my footprint and weight. The 14\" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is just what I needed. If you're someone who needs absolutely top notch performance, I'd recommend upgrading the RAM and going with the M1 Max.\n"]},

Apple said they'd find workarounds to make it scarce, and they have.", "The speakers are wonderful as well. I was skeptical at first -- thought I caught some tinny effects on a couple songs, but the more I listen to them, the more I'm convinced the tinniness was in the recording (it was a live album, which might explain it). As for the spatial audio, I've only heard a couple songs, but it's pretty trippy. This is my first experience with it, and it doesn't disappoint.", "In the short time I've had the computer, it's been nothing but fast. Probably more computer than I need, so if you're a sound editor or photographer, this review probably isn't for you. But for those of you casual users who want a solid machine that will last (as I said, my last macbook pro made it more than a decade), this is the one.

{"profile-name": "Jake", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  M1 pro chip is super powerful - photo/video editing, graphic design - this thing just kills it. Compared to previous MacBook Pro, it's a giant leap ahead. These tasks are a main reason to buy the pro version of the Macbook. This particularly model is the lower end of the spec you can get for a pro,  but it still kicks butt. You can get the Pro Max chip and bump up the RAM to 64GB if you want - and add tons more storage. The 14 inch MacBook pro is the perfect size for a balance of portability and power. It can do pretty much everything the 16 inch version does. The display is stunning. Just gorgeous. 120hz capability (pro motion) gets rid of blur when scrolling and makes for clearer action when viewing movies. The brightness and black levels on the display are awesome. Real HDR viewing -  a big difference. You will hear about \"the notch\" at the top of the screen where the camera is. After 10 minutes I don't even notice it. It means nothing for your experience. Its just something critics have chosen to harp about. in most apps the notch is no even visible. Camera is now a full 1080p and is a big upgrade over previous MacBooks. Six speaker sound system with new woofers - sounds incredible. Music/movies it feels like surround sound. For video conferencing the microphones are studio quality and you can tell - this is great for video conferencing. The keyboard is a dream to type on. Very solid like all MacBooks, no spongy feel you get with so many other laptops. The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best - as is the track pad. Battery life is amazing. I have gone all day on battery without needing to plug in. At best its spec says 17 hours, which is crazy! Especially for this spec...but for real world use with a mix of tasks, it won't be 17 hours but I did a 9 hour session yesterday, and still had a ton of battery left. The power efficiency is ground breaking. They have added back the MagSafe power plug - which is great! And added back an SD card slot and and an HDMI port - which many of us hated the previous macs that deleted these ports. I wish it had at least one USB-A old style port - but it doesn't. You get three USB-C thunderbolt 4 ports that you can use with adapters if needed. They got rid of the touch screen bar at the top of the keyboard from previous pro MacBooks and put back the regular mechanical keys for the controls. Apparently they listened to a lot of users who didn't really like the touch pad. The shape and style of this laptop is great. Some say the edge of the laptop looks \"sharp\" where your wrists rest. That is BS. I have been typing most of the day and I don't feel any issue with the edge of the laptop at all. Very comfy for typing. Some haters may try to find reasons to bash this new Macbook Pro, but I am telling you - from any perspective, all brand bias aside -  this is an amazing laptop - the best Apple has ever made, hands down. And I would say you won't find a better power laptop anywhere.  All that said - this is not a gamers machine. Apple is not for hard core gamers. I mean you can play games on it that you get from the app store. I am a hard core gamer and a PC geek  - I have a powerful windows PC for gaming. And always will. But for everything else. this MacBook is king. I use to for music, for photo and video editing, for productivity. I can plut into a giant monitor if I want a bigger screen - it works great on my 34 inch IPS panel. So if you are wondering if this Macbook 14 inch pro is the real deal or not - I am here to tell you, its the real deal. I finally upgraded from my 2015 MacBook pro because this new one hits so many sweet spots - revolutionary power and battery life, excellent ergonomic design, great sound, stunning display - its the whole package. If you are thinking of getting one - you won't be disappointed. One last comment. I am an old timer windows guy, and I know all the counter arguments for the Mac. Many wills say this is overpriced compared to a windows laptop with similar spec. First, show me an intel based laptop that can match these new M1 Pro chips - you can't. And aside from that, the Mac OS is secure and stable - rock solid - and is intuitive with amazing features - like the ability to copy and paste text FROM A PHOTO! Whaaat? And the design/ergonomics/quality of these MacBooks is unmatched. So, yes you pay more - but you get more. My last MacBook pro lasted me almost 7 years and it still works great. If you want this laptop - get it! It rocks.\n"]},

As someone who has dealt with both devils by the name of Apple and Microsoft, the operating system differences don't bother me (although, one thing I did find is that when I go home and I'm not able to do any gaming, it can be a bit of an irritation, but that was never why I bought this laptop to begin with). The screen and battery life on this thing are amazing. My previous laptops had terrible screens and had a max battery life of about two hours. This laptop, between using it for school, doing photo editing, graphic design, coding, and video editing, can easily last me up to two days or even more. The one thing I will say is that frequently in order for me see things most of the time, I need the screen cranked up past 50% brightness most of the time. I like the touch bar, I barely use function keys in most applications and the apps that do use them have the buttons on the touch bar anyways. I will say though unless you care about the touch bar, a slightly larger battery, and a fan being inside this machine (which for the record, with all of my use of heavy exports and edits, has never once turned on), just buy the MacBook Air. For school especially, it will get you across fine. The 8 GB model is also superb in most of the tasks I need to accomplish. I mean, it has similar performance in what I need for compared to my PC with a Ryzen 3700X, and RTX 3070, and 32GB of RAM. There were a couple of times where webpages tried to use more than 8GB of RAM and that caused some trouble, but after turning on an ad-blocker I never had that issue again. macOS has superb memory management, which allows for someone semi-professional like me to get by with it just fine.\n"]},

I'm so angry that my iTunes songs from the old iPad won't transfer to the new iPad.  Oh sure, the songs I purchased through Apple's iTunes do transfer but not the hundreds of albums/cd's/tapes I converted and loaded to iTunes. I did that with an Apple product and yet the new iPad won't accept them.  And there are some games I had on the old iPad that I enjoyed (ad free) but they won't transfer either - I'm forced to download a newer version of the same game which throws ads at me that are longer than the amount of time they let me play.  Play for 30 seconds, sit through 1+ mins of ads.  I'm keeping the iPad 2 for some things and also the new iPad 2020 11inch for most other things.\n"]},

I think the software upgrade from 15.1 in the future will make this pro 11 version with the M1 chip even better.

{"profile-name": "C", "review-star-rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  This 9th Gen iPad (2021) only got a few upgrades over the previous version, but is still the least expensive iPad option.", "Upgrades over 2020 version:", "-A13 Bionic Chip:  Previous version had A12 chip", "-Storage:  Now has either 64GB or 256GB, previous version was 32GB or 128GB", "-Selfie Camera:  Now has 12MP ultrawide front camera, previous version was 1.2MP standard front camera", "-Center Stage:  Front camera follows you to keep you centered in the frame, not available in previous version", "-True Tone:  Adjusts color temperature to match environment, not available in previous version", "So, of these features, the most noticeable upgrade is probably the improved front-facing camera.  This makes for better looking video calls and selfie photos, and the Center Stage camera tracking feature might be useful if you move around on video calls.  The A13 chip is supposed to be up to 20% faster also, although I haven't really noticed that much of a difference so far.", "Besides those upgrades I listed, everything else is almost exactly the same as the 2020 version of the regular iPad.  Same exact build, screen resolution, brightness, rear camera, speakers, battery, lightning charger port, and only support for Gen 1 Pencil (NOT Gen 2 Pencil).  There is no gold color available this year either.", "So to summarize, this 9th generation iPad is really just slightly faster, with more storage and a better front facing camera.  The True Tone feature isn't that noticeable to me really, and since the screen brightness wasn't upgraded, it still seems a bit dim at 500nits when you are outside on a bright day.", "Having said that, this is still the least expensive option for an iPad.  Apple is discontinuing the previous generation version from last year, so if you are looking for the cheapest iPad, this will be the one for the next 12 months or so.  At this price it is not at all a bad deal, I just wish it supported the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil, or at least had a USB-C port like the new Mini.  For now, I would not recommend upgrading from last years regular iPad, unless you absolutely need the better front camera.\n"]},
{"profile-name": "Zen", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  iPad is my go to device, other than my work computer. I use it for everything. From watching TV/Movies, to sketching to reading magazines, and everything else.", "Background: I currently own 4 iPads (12.9 inch iPad Pro 2015, 12.9 inch iPad Pro 2021, iPad 2018, and now 2021 iPad 10.2)  and have owned several others before, and a Surface Pro, a recent Surface Book, and 2 Kindle Fire tablets so I can say with confidence I am a tablet user. :-) Tablets are how I consume my content and though I've given other devices a chance I keep coming back to iPads due to the intuitive interface and not having to worry about the device,  and just enjoy my content.", "Why I like this iPad 10.2 inch:", "Why did I get this one despite owning a 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 inch?", "This size of iPad is at the right price point and it has the right features, to make it my everywhere in the home, backyard, and travel companion. This is the one I don't have to worry about losing vs. my 2021 iPad Pro 1 TB that was just under $2K. The size makes it super convenient to carry around to read in a park or on the plane, do a quick FaceTime call while reading a recipe off it in the kitchen (the FT appears in a little window) and cooking. I love sketching on my iPad, and this 10.2 iPad though smaller than iPad Pro 12.9, feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro 12.9 inch is a magazine size (see photos for comparison of 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 with this iPad) and can be heavy to hold with one hand, I need to prop it up while sketching. I find the new iPad even more responsive to the Apple pencil, it's a joy to sketch on these or take quick notes during meetings, that then convert to text if I want. Though I LOVE my iPad Pro this one gets a lot of use due to the size and portability.", "I like keeping this one on my recliner arm to browse around when I am next to the TV to find out more about the program I'm watching, or to read a book in bed without worrying about dropping it on my face. The iPad Pro needs to be propped up, and once almost broke my nose when I got sleepy and it fell on my face! I also love looking at my photos that I take on the iPhone on my iPad as it's more immersive and so much easier to show someone than squinting at the phone. I usually keep the photos in iCloud due to the limit on storage on the device, and the iPad can just download them when I am viewing them. I also do craft work, and watching YouTube instruction videos and reading my crochet patterns is great on this size, it's just ready on the side of my sofa. I also drop it countless times (with case on) as it's sitting on the sofa arm, something I worry more about with the iPad Pro as it's bigger. I also like that this is the one device that still has a headphone jack, I own some sets of high end earbuds that use the traditional jack and it's great to be able to use them with it as the bluetooth buds need to be charged and sometimes I just want things to be simpler.", "The 12 MP Front Camera on this 2021 version is great as FaceTime is so much clearer than my older version, I had to switch to my phone to FaceTime earlier due to the blurry video, but now I can do it right from the iPad. iOS 15 has all new features like Center Stage where the camera moves with the participant in a call, and that makes it so useful. I typically don't use a keyboard on my 10.2 iPad as I rarely type on it. I prefer doing that on my iPad Pro, but I've tried this size with Belkin and Logitech keyboards and they worked really well. Although I could fold them back, I just didn't like the added weight as I did not use the keyboard often enough and once you put on that keyboard cover the advantages of a light tablet go away.", "Overall, I would not really recommend upgrading if you have a recent iPad, but if you want to give your older iPad to a kid or your mom and get this one, go for it. However, I do recommend getting an iPad over other tablets. iOS 15 has unlocked even more features on it and it's super intuitive. It makes me happy to have a device where I can sketch at a moments notice, watch a show, or a craft video, edit my docs, write down my \"bright\" ideas with Apple pencil and have them convert to text, talk to my friends on video and oh yes, also listen to music, although I do that more on my phone. And it's the right size to carry in my purse, and I don't have to panic about dropping it or even losing it. Go ahead, you deserve it.\n"]},

It\u2019s fast, stable and has a good battery life.  I love the sound and video quality.  Handles mobile gaming and my heavy use well.  I debated between this device and the iPad Pro 2020 for quite a while.  I felt like I wanted the power and longevity of the new chip, but didn\u2019t need the extra features of the pro.  I do believe that the next pro coming out will have the best of both worlds and have a better display so if it\u2019s in your budget and you don\u2019t mind waiting, I\u2019d get the iPad Pro 2021.  Otherwise the iPad Air 4 is a fantastic device.  Unlike any other tablet I\u2019ve owned, it truly meets my needs.  I literally do everything on my iPad and am on it almost always.", "My gripe about this was the storage size options.  The base iPad Air should start at 128 instead of 64gb.  I upgraded because I had serious storage issues with my last device and because I plan on doing image editing and blogging in the future so I wanted the space to work with.  I use this as my main device and will do so for the foreseeable future. If you\u2019re someone who needs more room but are not actively working on multiple or large videos/images, then I\u2019d recommend the 64gb device and to purchase external storage drives.  iCloud too is an option for storage.  And of course picking up a 2018/2020 pro is an option if you need more space and it\u2019s in your budget.", "Last point- this was a very expensive purchase for me.  But my base iPad 5th generation impressed me so much with how long it lasted and how well it performed that I didn\u2019t mind making the investment in the new air.  I\u2019d never owned an Apple device before so it\u2019s not a platform I\u2019m loyal to.  I have however owned several android tablets that didn\u2019t work well for me, didn\u2019t last long, or became outdated.  My iPad 5 was from 2017, fully functional and it\u2019s still supported.  It will likely lose support with the next major iOS upgrade likely next year- it has the same chip as the iPhone 6 I believe.  I upgraded because of this, storage issues, and wanting a more powerful modern device.  I expect the iPad Air 4 to be supported and last at least 4 years.\n"]},

I bought it together with the 1st generation apple pencil with the idea of replacing all my paper notebooks and taking notes at college with it and I would say that the experience has been flawless. Its not the best ipad available, I know that the Ipad air is sexier, has a bigger screen and supports the 2nd generation pencil but this ipad is just extraordinary for any student. Besides, my experience with the 1st apple pencil is incredible, there is practically no delay while writing, the screen size is excellent for taking notes and the palm rejection technology allows me to take notes fastly. The only downside is that there is a gap between the glass and the screen and you can see it while writing but its not a real issue, you get used to it. To conclude, if money is not a problem for you and you are a student willing to replace all your paper notebooks I recommend you to get the ipad air + 2nd generation combo but if you dont have 700$ to get it you wont regret buying the iPad 9th and not getting the better one.\n"]},

It lasts about 10 hours, same as my 6th gen. However, the screen quality, the sound system, and the graphics and speed makes up for it. Honestly, I didn\u2019t need to buy this. I decided to after considering it for months. I needed more storage space than the 32gb my 6th gen came with. The fact that it came with a trial for Apple Arcade and Apple TV + was an added bonus. I forgot to add AppleCare+ to my purchase, but that was easily remedied. Once I logged into my new iPad it asked if I wished to purchase a subscription. I got one for 3.99/mo until cancelled. If you do decide to buy one of these, then please get the Apple Care +. I have it for my phone and now for this iPad and it\u2019s so worth it. Some more cons, and this is entirely just because I find it aesthetically pleasing, is that you cannot add widgets to your Home Screen as you can on your phone. Not a major downfall, but still saddening. The keyboard is quick responsive and there is no lag between the onscreen keyboard and your typing movements. It doesn\u2019t have the battery performance settings like the iPhone XR does where it tells you where your battery life is currently optimized to. (My phone is at 91%, I wish I could check the iPad but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an app for that) I will later on use this for school and will add the Apple Pencil and possibly the magic keyboard as well.", "All in all I give this a 3.8/5", "Will update as I explore more", "Oh, also, the blue doesn\u2019t look as blue as I thought it would.

{"profile-name": "Aidan Hunt", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  TLDR: This is the best choice for someone new to the iPad line or wanting to upgrade from an old model. It supports the same, second-gen Apple Pencil as the top of the line iPad Pro, while a unique combination of Touch ID and slim bezels by moving the fingerprint sensor to the top button. And, its got a USB-C port and Wi-Fi 6 for easier connectivity.", "Let's take a look at where the Air sits in comparison to the rest of the iPad line--in other words, why pay more to get the Air instead of the basic iPad? As a quick recap, Apple's current line of iPads is divided into four different categories: iPad Mini, iPad, iPad Air (this product), and iPad Pro.", "The iPad and iPad mini feature the traditional, circular home button with Touch ID sensor inside (similar to a blown-up version of the iPhone 7/8/SE), and they have fairly large bezels (this is especially bad on the size-conscious Mini). These models have older generation CPUs and only support the first-generation Apple Pencil. This version of the Pencil has an easy-to-lose cap covering a Lightning port for charging it (which requires an adapter, or awkwardly plugging into into the bottom of your iPad). It's completely cylindrical and will easily roll of a desk. These cheaper models also don't support the Magic Keyboard, which allows your iPad to \"levitate\" above the keys; they only support a simpler Smart Keyboard where the keys and iPad screen come together at the hinge.", "With the Air, you get the same Magic Keyboard as is available for the Pro--and the same second generation Apple Pencil, which supports double-tap (ex to change pencil to eraser tool) and magnetically mounts and charges on the side of your iPad, rather than awkwardly sticking out the bottom.", "By upgrading to the Air (this model), you get a slightly larger screen (10.9\" vs 10.2\", thanks to the smaller bezels). And, the screen improves in quality as well as size. The Air has a fully laminated display, which means there's no air gap between the screen and the glass--preventing reflections and the hollow sound when you tap on the screen. The downside is that breaking the front glass is a more expensive repair--that's why the school-friendly base model iPad doesn't include this feature. The Air also includes True Tone and wide color, which makes the display look more vibrant by adapting to the lighting conditions around you.", "You also get much better connectivity with the Air. You'll get the future-proof WiFi 6, which is just starting to hit the market, and a USB-C port that gives you more charging flexibility and lets you plug in hard drives, SSDs, SD cards, cameras, and monitors with an inexpensive USB-C hub instead of the pricey Lightning to Camera adapter required on older models. For those who haven't used iPad in a while, the latest iPadOS actually supports plugging in an external drive and browsing the files on it without any extra software, and that's a lot easier to do on the Air. If you have a Mac, Surface, or other recent computer, you're already familiar with what USB-C can do.", "Last but certainly not least, the iPad Air has the same A14 chip found in the latest iPhone 12 and 12 Pro lines. The basic iPad has the two and a half year old A12 chip instead. And, the base iPad has an atrocious 1.2MP front camera, which is hardly appropriate for today's Zoom-centric world.", "What are some reasons you might want to get the Pro instead of Air? Both look a lot alike they have the ultra-slim, black bezels (similar to a blown up iPhone X or later, minus the notch). But the iPad Pro also has an enormous 12.9\" option, which comes with Apple's best in class Super Retina XDR display technology--easily the best display on any tablet out there. This is only on the 12.9\"--so yet another reason to stick with the Air if you want the 11\" size--and it is similar to the display of the iPhone 12 or Apple's infamously expensive Pro Display XDR monitor. Unlike the iPhone, both sizes of the Pro come with a 120Hz display (refresh rate automatically switches from 24, 60, and 120 Hz based on the content you are viewing), which Apple calls ProMotion.", "Speaking of the 12.9\", my one complaint with the Air and the 11\" Pro is that they don't make very good use of the much larger screen space for the keyboard. They allow you to swipe down on the oversized letter keys to enter numbers, whereas the Pro actually displays a separate number row above the letter keys, like a real keyboard. That said, if this bugs you too, you may as well just get a Magic Keyboard or Bluetooth keyboard and use that.", "Both sizes of the Pro also have a better camera--a 12MP wide and 10MP ultra wide lens plus flash, similar to an iPhone 12. The Air, on the other hand, has the 12MP wide camera but no flash. Hardly anyone takes serious pictures on an iPad--but if you do, I recommend checking out the Halide pro camera app which was just redesigned for iPad last week. The front camera is also improved (12MP with ultra wide view on the Pro, and 7MP on the Air). The Pros also have USB4/Thunderbolt support for ultra-fast external SSD support, and they have the same M1 processor used on Macs. You can configure them with up to 2TB internal storage, vs only 256GB on the Air. I've never bought a cellular iPad (preferring to use the personal hotspot feature on my iPhone instead), but if you are looking at one, the Pro might make more sense because it comes with 5G support, similar to the iPhone 12.", "In conclusion, for most people this iPad Air offers everything you need in a future-proof package and great price point. For those who want it all, get the iPad Pro 12.9\" (think twice about the 11\" Pro since you're paying a premium price and missing the best-in class display of the 12.9\").\n"]},

I\u2019m mostly happy with it; the screen is great (despite no OLED tech) and USB-C is amazing in its versatility. The Touch ID integration for the lock button is forever awkward though. The camera bump is also an unusual thing we have to live with these days. Apple\u2019s omission of a 128GB model seems a very intentional \u201cin your face\u201d move, but at least I have more space than I need with the 256GB model.", "The user experience is pretty fantastic.

I think the files app could use further refinement too. It seems sluggish when copying files from an external drive, often crashing when I copy files before even getting the opportunity to paste them in the iPad storage. I\u2019m also rather annoyed that Apple keeps Photos storage segmented from Files. Why am I not able to access things that make perfect sense to access? That\u2019s what a files app is intended to do. All in all though, really big fan of how they have everything laid out, and I\u2019m glad iPadOS gets specific usability features to make things more intuitive.", "It finally comes down to performance. This thing shreds whatever I throw at it. My use case is fairly niche: apart from the usual mobile computing, I was hoping to have a capable mobile machine for light video editing via LumaFusion. I\u2019m delighted to say that\u2014apart from some stability issues with copying clips from SD cards in Files and some export instability with LumaFusion (the app\u2019s fault, not Apple\u2019s)\u2014this sucker destroys light to moderate video editing with H264 and even some H265 video.

I also got a weird effect intermittently from one or both Airpods during a call.  It was like a whoosh or special effect sound similar to a surround sound simulator.  It was totally random.  Some callers said my voice would drop intermittently as well.  I did a full reboot/reset with no change.  I was using with an iPhone 11.

At home I've gone through about ten different computers over the years, starting with the original IBM PC which I bought in 1983. This is the first Apple product I've ever bought.", "Aside from a few quirks, the iPad Air 4 is the ideal household computer. It's extremely compact, has a supremely powerful and fast processor, a nice camera, excellent WiFi 6, and a breathtakingly beautiful video processor/monitor. It comes with no keyboard, case or prop. I suppose it's just supposed to sit in your lap as sold.", "Luckily I've found several different mounting clamps, ergonomic Bluetooth keyboards, Bluetooth mice, a case/keyboard and a hub I can plug into its single USB-C port. It's the only port you need, handling everything from power to video to extra memory easily and all at once if you plug a hub into it. I have one iPad Air 4 that I move between several locations around my home, each with a large ergonomic Bluetooth keyboard and mouse at ideal typing level and the mount for the iPad at eye level on a desk shelf. I can type away comfortably for hours -- or watch a movie as I snack. With the hub, I can use a wired Ethernet network -- much faster than WiFi and more reliable. I expect it to last several years, so I use a screen protector and case. I've cracked one screen protector already with no damage to my iPad.", "Now for the quirks. The hub I bought has an HDMI port for an external monitor. Unfortunately, you can't change the aspect ratio of the picture, so you end up with an image narrower than that of most monitors. You better have a monitor with sound, as using the HDMI port cuts off the iPad Air's otherwise nice speakers. This machine runs iPadOS, a version of IOS. It doesn't have as many features, making it harder to run productivity software -- my principle use for my iPad. MicroSoft Office's iPad version is hobbled as a result. So, my older Windows tablet must fill the gap sometimes. It takes the dongle to use wired headphones. I have some nice Bluetooth headphones, but I miss the super high fidelity of my wired cans if I can't use the hub. Video calls with Apple FaceTime and Google Duo are glorious on that screen, but if you don't have it rotated to portrait mode, the selfie camera ends up on the left edge.

On the speed front it is amazing; loads documents, web pages and apps very quickly.  No performance issues.", "The screen quality on the other hand is terrible in my opinion.  Not sure if this is standard or if mine was just defective, but the viewing angle is noticeably worse than my old iPad.  Even rotating it a few degrees while reading in bed changed the colors on a white background to pink and darkened the edges.  This remained unchanged even when adjusting the automatic color correction.  This led me to look up issues with the screen on this model, which also showed that there was significant backlight bleeding in one corner.  Further, when comparing the screen to my old iPad there is much more reflection on the iPad Air.  All this combined resulted in an annoying game of adjusting my wrist to maintain the exact right angle so that it didn't distract me while reading a news article or .pdf.", "I'll make one more observation in my albeit limited time with this product.  The battery also seems to drain faster while doing the same activities I would normally do on my old iPad.  It came out of the box at 96% and after less than 8h of intermittent use (surfing, checking e-mail, reading news article and documents) it had dropped 25%.  I can't make a direct comparison to my old iPad, but it feels like that was a considerably faster rate of battery usage.", "In the end, the increased performance simply could not make up for the poor screen quality.

The first song sold me on the AirPods 3, the audio was just that good compared to AirPods 2 and even rivaled AirPods Max. They are well worth the money. The one down side is the fit. The AirPods 2 fit me perfect, I've had some instances of the AirPods 3 falling out of my ear. The plastic shell feels more slippery and doesn't have as secure fit for me. If I get animated like running or something with action body movement theres a good chance one or both are going to fall out. I'll knock 1 star for that, but it may fit you fine. I kept them as I'm mostly working from home now and their primary use will be watching movies on the Apple TV. When I'm out I use the AirPods 2.

Yes they fit a little less secure than my old ones but they still stay in place. They only *feel* like they will come out. It\u2019s the first thing you\u2019ll have to adjust to. The sound is noticeably better with substantial bass and midrange. No question the drivers have been updated and they just sound richer than before. But you can take that better sound to the next level by turning on spatial audio. Best way to describe it is when you\u2019re connected and listening from your macbook, it will seem like the sound is coming FROM the macbook but in full high fidelity. Turn your head and you\u2019ll hear *where* your macbook is from the sound. When I first turned spatial audio on I thought the airpods weren\u2019t working. You can also have spatial audio just locked in without the location effect.", "With the additional battery life, and wireless Magsafe charging, this is a great upgrade from the last one.

For earbuds that expensive, it\u2019s not acceptable. And why I gave these a try.", "Sound quality wise, I like these ones best of all the AirPods. Spatial audio is absolutely amazing. Their stem is smaller than the first gen, which is nice, and they have no noise cancelling. I consider that an advantage, but it really depends on individual use. I run and need to hear my surroundings. Turning off noise cancelling on the Pros turns on their mics and every sound gets amplified, including hair swishing back and forth or a hat covering them and moving ever so slightly, it drives me nuts. For people who do not need noise cancelling, this is much better. And cheaper too.", "I also like the fit better, I\u2019ve never liked and used ear buds with tips that need to be inserted in the ear canal. However, they don\u2019t stay put and that\u2019s their one major drawback. They need some kind of tips to secure them in the ear and Apple should provide those.

The Dolby Atmos and taunts of fitting better than the 2nd gen Airpods and being more similar to the pros prompted me to try these out as soon as they were available. My first impressions were that they are extremely slippery almost designed to be so that I bobbled them more often than not and the fit in the case was much much more awkward than the 2nd gen ones. All that aside I hoped that the sound quality would make up for any other qualms I had. I immediately subscribed to a free trial of Apple music as that seemed to be the best music test by all accords. With all the quality settings turned up I don't really notice a huge difference between 2nd gen and 3rd gen Airpods.

Comparing to the pros, I think the sound quality is on par, but the wear comfort level is much much better than the all-sealed pros. If you are comfortable with 1st and 2nd gen, the 3rd gen will be a pleasure to use and wear (for hours!). But if you already have a pair of Pros and feel comfortable wearing them, then there is no need for moving to the 3rd gen.

{"profile-name": "Robert Sabin", "review-star-rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  Remember when each new version of an Apple product used to be an improvement? those days are long gone. Each new iteration of the iPad is significantly worse than the last, with a frustrating lack of attention to basic problems that keep the OS in the dark ages. How do you screw up an on off button? Well in this case you make sure it won\u2019t turn on when you press the on button.  Instead you have to hold it down for an indeterminate amount of time, and to turn it off you don\u2019t just press the off button, you have to also press one of the volume buttons. Stupid. Even more frustrating, if your iPad is off (because presumably your battery is low) and you plug it in the power will just come on automatically and continue to drain your battery. Having your iPad plugged in while on will result in the need to keep it plugged in for a significant amount of time before it will become charged, if at all.  This is absolutely ridiculous and makes it almost impossible to keep a full charge on the device. The battery itself drains extremely quickly even when you turn off all of the obnoxious apple options, continuously interacting with the Internet, and Siri.  Unlike the OS for iPhone, there is no option to go into a low power mode. Moving apps on the home screen and organizing your contact is still extremely frustrating. Because they\u2019ve gotten rid of the single button you cannot just simply return to the home screen, you were continuously trying to swipe up most of the time to no affect. To close apps is even worse you have to attempt multiple times to swipe up and hope that the various apps appear in front of you so that you can swipe yet again to turn them off. Of course this is all in an attempt to save battery life because the battery is so poor.  And because they\u2019ve got rid of the central button and you were continuously swiping on everything your screen becomes disgustingly filled with fingerprints, grime, and dirt almost instantly.  Using a stylus is not any better as they don\u2019t seem to have the technology right to make this an easy solution to the problem of a poorly designed tablet.  Of course the lack of a headphone jack is it an appalling omission as Apple has never been serious about quality Bluetooth and their headphones have been the most consistently avoided tech the last 20 years .  I seriously question whether anybody who designed this device has ever actually used it in a day today environment, as the developers are obviously ignorant of these obvious problems.  Apple seems to have no desire to make things better, only to clutter devices with features that become an onerous burden rather than solving problems for the user. This will definitely be my last iPad.\n"]},

As for the sound, I find the overall quality of this pair better than the first. The full dynamic range is more crisp/clear and these make the first generation sound a little muddy. The primary reason I didn\u2019t give 5 stars is since they don\u2019t fit as snug, background noise gets in the way.

{"profile-name": "Simon Waxman", "review-star-rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  The 3rd generation Apple Airpods are a major disappointment. The principal issue is that they are designed to lie limply on your earlobe rather than in the ear canal, as other earbuds are. The Airpods provide NO SOUND ISOLATION at all. None. Zilch. The result is that you can't hear anything coming out of these earbuds unless you're sitting in a quiet room, which is not what earbuds are for. Their purpose lies in their portability. Yet a soft breeze, to say nothing of city traffic or a subway ride, will overwhelm the audio from these cans. What's the point of headphones you can't hear? Good question.", "When I listened in a quiet room just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, I found the audio quality decent, slightly improved over that off my other off-brand earbuds. But those cost one-third the price of the AirPods. (Oh, and they have sound isolation.) I should be getting much better audio quality at this price. Instead Apple has done what all the non-audio companies selling headphones are doing: boosting the bass and forgetting everything else. Listeners are too checked out to notice or care what they're hearing; all they can detect is bass. That's why every new product made by any company that isn't Bose, Sennheiser, or one of the other legacy brands is bass-forward. It's marketing, not sound. As a musician and careful listener, I'm the opposite of impressed.", "I give the Airpods credit for superior internal mic'ing, which allows you to place calls more effectively than with other earbuds. My interlocutor was able to hear me relatively clearly using these earbuds, an improvement over the competition. There were still issues of wind noise and that \"far-away\" sound, however. Interference and distance are unavoidable with earbud mics, but some do better than others when it comes to filtering and signal processing in order to overcome environmental effects, and the Airpods do shine here.", "The Airpods also pair seamlessly with my iPhone, the first time and every time. But this isn't anything to celebrate. It simply clarifies that Apple is trying to force us to buy their overpriced, underperforming audio products by boxing out competitors. Such seamless pairing should be possible with other products as well, but instead Apple uses proprietary technologies that mar the usability of other brands. Imagine if, back in the day, Sony's Discman or Walkman was only compatible with Sony's headphones, and every other brand required an adapter. That is what's happening here; only the details of the tech are different. This seamlessness is not a feather in the Airpods' cap. It's a powerplay by Apple, earth's richest company, trying to squelch the competition--including competition from companies that actually want to do audio the right way.", "On the whole the 3rd-gen Airpods are not only useless, they are an indictment of Apple's corporate practices and, worse, a reflection of the sorry state of consumer audio in the era of low-fi streaming. It should not be possible to sell a product this faulty at a price point this high. If you want low-end earbuds, you can get them for $19.99 at CVS. If you want to spend $170, you can get excellent headphones from an audio company.

Passive mode is great and these work well talking on the phone also.

The Max excels greatly pairs to an Apple TV watching movies.", "What isn\u2019t so good?  They\u2019re too hot to wear for workouts. I prefer something to let my ears breathe more when I\u2019m exercising, so in-ear options may be a better choice. The case is a joke but not totally useless. The problem is while the case does protect the aluminum cups, it isn\u2019t well made and does nothing to protect the comparatively more fragile parts of the earphones. No charger? No problem as have a  box full of USB and USB-C chargers already. Another small qualm is because of the case material, when you first unbox the Max, there is a very strong and unpleasant polymer type odor, but it goes away quickly.", "Finally the biggest problem: the price. I think $350-400 is more reasonable. I had extra money I could afford to spend but I just don\u2019t think $550 is realistic.  Apple aims to get you to spend as much as they can and from what I can see of demand and my own spending, they are winning people over.

I also feel there is potential in the magnet APM cups that can be changed as desired. If you don't like the ones that come with the APM you could potentially purchase a 3rd party option of a different material.", "I prefer the Sony's for sound quality. You can tweak the EQ to your liking with their app. With the APM you are stuck with their default sound signature or the terrible presets in iOS settings. The default APM sound is good but leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Sony's which literally lets you tweak it to how your ears desire. I am a bass-head and the APM bass simply lacking for rap and pop music (to my ears).", "While I think the concept of the APM physical controls for volume and track selection is superior to Sony's touch controls for the same, the placement of these buttons on the top of the right cup is baffling. I'm confident most people are like myself and like to adjust their headphones by gripping the top and bottom of their respective ear cups. By doing so you will inevitably press on these buttons. The Sony's have two buttons located on the bottom side edge (on/off and a custom button that by defaults lets you toggle modes). Far better placement.", "The 'smart case' is actually nothing but a sleeve that is rather ridiculous as it's required to properly turn off the headphones entirely. Why Apple opted for no on/off button is beyond me. The APM come with no cable to connect to airplane entertainment systems, no travel case, no ability to fold into a more compact size, and no charging brick. A $550 set of headphones should include a charging brick and nice travel case, don't you think??", "The Sony's meanwhile have all the cables you could possibly need, fold into a compact size, and comes with a lovely hardshell case. It doesn't have a charging brick but it's also far less expensive compared to the APM.", "Ah yes, price. At retail the APM are $550 and while the Sony's retail for $350, they can often be found brand new for $280, literally half the price.", "So let's recap. APM have amazing ANC, transparency mode, mic for phone calls, the ability to swap out the ear cups, and flawlessly work with multiple Apple products.", "The Sony's allow you to tweak the sound to your liking, are more comfortable by far to wear, an on/off button plus superior button placement, a hardshell case, fold into a compact size, include the necessary cables for travel, and cost half as much as the APM.\n"]},

The screen resolution is pretty much the same but this iPad has a Liquid Retina display instead of just a Retina display but most people might not be able to tell the difference. There is 4gbs Of ram compared to the 3gbs in the 9th gen which makes this one better at saving apps in the background so you don\u2019t need to reload them as much. The Touch ID in the power button is fast and accurate, I was a bit worried it wouldn\u2019t be as good as the home button one but it is pretty much the same. If you care about cameras this iPad has a better back camera but a worse front camera compared to the 9th gen. This iPad has Bluetooth 5.0 instead of 4.2 like the 9th gen this makes it better if you\u2019re going to use multiple Bluetooth devices like a keyboard and earbuds.

Apple did their home work in designing these headphones.  I'd go so far to say that you will not find another headphone wired or not that has as good as sound for the money.", "2.  Comfort/Fit.  One goes with the other.  The head band is comfortable for my large head and does not squeeze my ears.  The ear pad material is not what I'd like but it is surprisingly comfortable.  Typical of any headphones they are best used without glasses for maximum comfortable. If you use glasses put the pads on your ears with the glasses on for maximum comfort.  I do not notice any weight - these are much lighter than most wired headphones.  The ear space fits my large ears although ideally a couple of extra mm's would be better.", "3.  They connect easily once you go through the initial connection procedure.  Most importantly they have excellent battery life.  They have double or more battery life than Pros.  Put them in the case when you are through with them for the day as it is the only way they turn off.  You will otherwise lose battery life as they are otherwise constantly scanning for possible bluetooth targets.  The case is not great but it works well for being put into a bag or backpack.  Generally they do a good job of picking up your voice in telephone or FaceTime mode.", "4.  They are an excellent value.  Usually a substantial discount means that there is a newer model is coming out.  My research suggests that is not the case.  There is likely to be a newer model of the Pros coming out which explains their greater discount.", "I am very pleased with these headphones and I think that you will be equally as pleased.\n"]},

Buy these and forget about needing any more gear.  No cables, no amps, no A/D converters, no tower speakers, no subwoofers, nothing.  I own very high end systems with top-rated versions of all of the above and I can tell you that AirPods Max cans sound as good as anything you can buy. They have one small flaw (beside the stupid name) and that is that the included case/bikini underwear is pathetic and storing them elsewhere uncovers the fact that auto device switching is not perfect which can consequently cause them to lose charge when they keep turning on and off.

They have the best sound for Bluetooth headphones - only comparable to Bluetooth headphones costing $850 or more (I have listened to multiple examples). Good separation of instruments and could hear finer detail than my previous Beats headphones. Good audiophile headphones can cost more than $5,000 and also require equally expensive extra equipment to work and are tethered. For Bluetooth headphones, these have great sound and separation. I signed up for Apple Music which is recommended for these headphones giving you the full benefit of their capabilities for music. They work flawlessly in the Apple ecosystem going seamlessly from one device to another for example if you get a phone call and will automatically pause things like a YouTube video if you adjust the headphones or temporarily take them off. If you are using them for editing video then it is recommended that you purchase the $35 cord because Bluetooth gives a very slight delay when you are editing video. Lossless sounds really good but to get the full benefit of Lossless you need the cord and a DAC (digital audio converter).  The Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio work great without a cord and many of the apps for streaming like Apple TV, Disney and Paramount have spatial audio. Watching Picard was fantastic.

If you're using a PC, I'm sorry. Perhaps one day you will see the light. The iMac I purchased is beautiful in every way, and I have no complaints at all. However, I do have one tip for new buyers. Once you set up your iMac, the very first thing you need to do is make sure you have the latest OS. To do this, click on System Preferences and then click Software Updates. Most likely you'll need an update, so do that before you do anything else. You'll need to reboot your iMac and that will take a few minutes (it took mine around 15 minutes), but then you'll be able to do everything else you need to do, such as setting up your App Store account. Other than that, the iMac is ready to go out the box, and what a beautiful box it is. Enjoy!\n"]},

Much more detail in in movies and music. Transparency mode is greatly improved. The noise cancellation is the best I\u2019ve heard on any headphones or earbuds. I really like the sound dial mostly cause it\u2019s the same as an Apple Watch but the location and design could have been improved. I really hate the price but luckily I got them on sale but at least Apple could have evaded included their $35 wired cord to make it a little more worth the price crazy of $550. I\u2019m not really a fan of the overall shape of the ear cups, to me they look like the headphones you wear when you go shooting. The mesh on the top of the headphones are really comfortable I really can\u2019t feel much on the top of my head. One massive flaw with these is that they don\u2019t have a power button and you have to put them in the case to prevent the battery from draining. But whenever I extend the headphones it feels like I\u2019m about to break them but it\u2019s smoother than other headsets and other headphones just click instead of sliding in. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me but when I plug in the it makes cord a bussing sound in the left ear. There are many nice headphones out there but these are the nicest headphones I\u2019ve ever put over my beautiful ears. But really suggest getting a different carrying cause though.\n"]},

{"profile-name": "Shnakepup", "review-star-rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I've previously used the original AirPods and the AirPods Pro. In particular, I really valued the noise cancellation on the Pro. However, I had issues with one of the Pro earbuds developing a crackling noise. I had it replaced, but after the warranty period expired, then the other earbud developed the same issue. I saw the AirPods Max go on sale and I had a gift card so I took the plunge. This is definitely more than I would normally pay for headphones but I figured that I had a good track record with Apple so far, all things considered, and I assumed the premium cost would be reflected in the quality of the product. Unfortunately, the Max fell short.", "First, the good: the build quality seems good. The headband is comfortable, and I never get any pain on the top of my head from wearing it for long periods of time (which frequently happens to me with other headphones). The volume dial/button/crown thing is nifty, and I like that there's a dedicated button to toggle back and forth between Transparency Mode and noise cancellation. Similar to the AirPods Pro, it also does an auto-pause thing when you take them off which is much appreciated. The overall sound quality seems really good, though I'm not an audiophile so I can't say much more than that.", "Some minor gripes: the volume dial/button/crown thing can be a little squirrely. I wish it required a little more resistance to push down or turn. As it is right now, I find myself often accidentally activating it. Also, the auto-pause feature sometimes doesn't work correctly. It definitely knows when it's completely off your head but often doesn't recognize if I've pulled them down around my neck; despite not being on my ears anymore, I can still hear the music or whatever playing. I'm guessing it uses proximity sensors or something to detect if it's \"on\" your head or not, and being on your neck confuses it? I dunno, seems like that's something they should've accounted for, as that's a pretty natural thing to do with headphones like these. Also, seems like half the time if I take them off then put them back on, it'll automatically unpause, but half the time it won't and I need to manually resume. Not a huge deal but irritating and inconsistent. Also, one last minor gripe: the tops of my ears sometimes gets sore in these, because when I put them on, they touch the inner wall of the ear cup (which is covered in rough material). I guess my ears are bigger than what they designed for?", "Lastly, the problems. Or mostly just the one problem: the noise cancellation doesn't seem all that great. It seems like it *could* be great, or maybe is *supposed* to be, but maybe the shape of my head just doesn't conform to Apple's assumptions. When I wear the Max and have noise cancellation on, it's inconsistent in how it blocks out sound. For instance, if I turn my head to one side, the quality of the cancellation shifts wildly (either from good-to-nonexistent or vice-versa). I work with multiple monitors so this is something I'm doing a lot, and it's very distracting to have the noise cancellation shift so much every time I do this. Also, I've noticed that if I literally press down on the sides (i.e. pressing them more onto my ears) the cancellation gets dramatically better. It seems like the ear cups aren't getting a good seal against my head and thus are letting in too much outside noise. I've tried adjusting the headband in various ways but nothing seems to help.", "This is a pretty major disappointment for me. Considering the price, I would expect the noise cancellation to be at least on par with the AirPods Pro, if not better. Perhaps they are if you have the right shape head and ears, but unfortunately that's not the case for me. Maybe it's not fair to compare the Max to the Pro, since the Pro are in-ear buds vs the Max's over-ear design. But STILL...look at the price! I'm not sure why these are so much more expensive. If you're looking at both of these, what's the advantage to getting the Max over the Pro? I really can't think of anything that's THAT much better on the Max. Like I said before, maybe the sound quality is much better on the Max, but I honestly can't tell the difference. The one thing that DOES stick out to me is the noise cancellation experience, and these are definitely not as good.\n"]},

They also come with multiple sizes of the in-ear rubber tips to make sure you have a comfortable fit.", "When using noise cancellation for the first time, you might notice that your ears hurt a little bit.

Please note this is nothing to be afraid of, just merely a warning so you don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re going to have long-term issues.", "They also work just fine in transparency mode which uses its external microphones to let noise come in so music and play in the background while you\u2019re still aware of your surroundings. I highly recommend these over apples standard AirPods because these have a much more superior sound quality, including a better mid range and bass.

So I thought I'd look into a pair of noise-cancelling wireless earbuds.

The ANC on them is, as expected, a joke, and I don't use that \"feature\".", "The AirPods Pro come in any color you like as long as it's white. There ARE ways to make them a bit more secure (anti-loss straps, earhooks) and I've used both of those with mine. The ANC.... at first I thought it did absolutely nothing. Then I found that they DO reduce some kinds of background noise. For example, there's a small fridge in my office. Without them in, I can hear a slight humming. WIth them in, but ANC turned off, there's actually a LOUDER hissing sound. With them in, but ANC turned on, I cannot hear the fridge at all.  Similarly, when someone in the next room is listening to something on the TV, with a door closed between us, I can't hear the TV at all with ANC turned on, and with ANC turned off, I can hear the TV (if slightly muffled).", "Long story short: They do reduce some kinds of background noise but will not do anything like the kind of job a good pair of over-the-ear phones will do.", "I have not yet had a chance to try these on any kind of transit, due to COVID. The Bose worked quite well for that - I could hear my audiobooks on the train without blasting the volume to dangerous levels. I suspect the AirPods would not work all that well; when I have a chance to try them on a train, I'll come back and update.", "Off-label use: my husband wanted a pair of these to use to improve his hearing (there are numerous articles out there about how this sort of earbud can be used as an inexpensive sound booster for those with mild hearing loss).

(Props to Apple for trying to innovate and the Touch Bar was a cool idea, but it was a solution that created more problems than it solved.) Eliminating more of the ports on more recent MBPs was also problematic, limiting everything to USB-C/Thunderbolt only, even down to killing the very popular MagSafe power plug. After getting one of those more recent models from my employer for work, I was able to find out first hand just how bad they really are.", "This new model reverses SO many of those poor design decisions. MagSafe has returned (while still retaining the ability to also charge over USB-C), the keyboard is far better, the Touch Bar has been eliminated and physical function keys have been brought back to replace it (YAY ESC), and a built-in HDMI port and SD card slot have also returned. As soon as I saw in the release announcement showing off what Apple had done with this machine, I ordered one immediately as I knew this was going to be a perfect replacement for my 2015 MBP - which I'd kept rather than upgrading to the subpar designs mentioned above. I don't regret the purchase at all. This is a fantastic machine.", "The only downsides I've experienced are due to the transition to the M1 processor. For 99% of users this won't matter one bit as the performance of the M1 Pro is exceptional. My individual problem is the migration of architecture; moving from x86/x64 to ARM meant instantly losing the ability to run VirtualBox and VMWare. VirtualBox will likely never run on the M1 architecture, and while VMWare is working on a new ARM version and Parallels is also available, they only allow for virtualization of ARM guest systems. Good enough for ARM builds of Linux (and limited versions of Windows), but Intel virtualization is now dead on the Mac.

If you are going to be in a loot of phone calls, eMeetings (Zoom, Webex, Facetime, etc.) these are very much the ones to get.  About the only thing these are not good for would be high head movement activities (athletics), there the Beats Fit Pro does better, but these are on a par or better than the competitive Sony or Bose variants (which are larger, so easier to dislodge).  Also, once paired with Apple devices, you can just move them around to be used with whatever you happen to be doing, iPad or iPhone or MacBook, they autoswitch, don't have to be re-paired, and also handle Siri commands.\n"]},

HOWEVER, noise is ONLY being cancelled for you, and your caller on the other end will very loudly hear every single little background noise on your end even when you can't.  This is quite an aggravating mode of operation.  Since that noise is being cancelled for you and you cannot hear it, you're oblivious and make even more background noise.

If you're in the Apple ecosystem, these will switch flawlessly with modern Apple devices. In the end, for me, it comes down to audio. How music sounds is very important to me.

{"profile-name": "Matt Eye", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I love this new iPad Pro, but it takes forever and an eternity for Apple to get these new pieces of beautiful tech in stock anywhere. Some complain about the blooming problem, but I don't do HDR and cannot afford a $10,000 Hasselblad to do that kind of content, so the brightness problem just does not affect me. This is a very nice 2 TB option, which Amazon only sells up to half a TB, unfortunately. I did buy a case and screen protector from here on Amazon, but have not reviewed them yet. Camera on the new iPad Pro is the one from the 2017 iPhone X, which is actually decent. Not in good light, still kind of blotchy. The native Camera App does not work with the 'tracking' that is new to the front-facing camera, but that is because you need certain third-party Apps that can utilize it. Not much else to say, I love iPads. Oh, the speakers on this thing almost as good and loud as my 27\" iMac! Five stars, very little to complain about as far as the product goes. Being hard to find is a Samsung issue and is irrelevant to rating this item. Thank you.\n"]},

I finally bit the bullet and I am very happy with my purchase, sure it is expensive, but keep in mind this  is the type of device you have to use for awhile to see why they charge what they do. If you already have a recent iPad pro, it may not be worth the cost of an upgrade, but if you are on the fence on whether to spend iPad pro money, I would say to give it a shot if you like to watch media and do anything that you may do on your phone, just much bigger and better scale. What convinced me to make this purchase and go for top of the line was I wanted a tablet to use to properly stream xbox and playstation games remotely and it does not disappoint doing that a bit.

{"profile-name": "dcime", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  3 Weeks In\u2026It\u2019s official, the New 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 Is currently the Best Tablet In The World. But please do not get this confused! This is much more than a Tablet. This is a full blown laptop replacement. It took a while, but they did it. The M1 Apple (in house) Processor, the 1000 nits of brightness with a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio screen. This is the NEW, the amazing, 2021 iPad Pro LED screen with that huge size! A newly made learning experience all for the best\u2026 My previous iPad (Sold for $200) was a 6th Gen standard iPad that was used primarily for surfing the web and streaming high res music from Tidal. I am a true music lover. I collect high end DAC\u2019s, Amps and Headphones, mostly wired. When I first pre-ordered the New iPad, for some reason I went with the 11 in. Why? Probably because it was $300 less expensive for one reason! Secondly, I convinced myself that a 12.9 screen size was just too big! Too big for everyday tasks and just too huge to lug around. I admit it now, I was dead wrong. The 11 in. had to go back. It was a sad day. I thought I had thought this one out. I was wrong. After 1 week with that 2021 iPad Pro 11 I felt almost cheated. I knew I was spending a lot of cash, but was it spent on the wrong device? I had hunger pains for the 12.9. It was meant to be! Then I did it, after tons of YouTube videos and 100\u2019s of articles\u2026 I packaged up that pre-orderd 11 in and proceeded to right then and there order the Brand New 2021 12.9 in, right here on Amazon. It was a painless transaction. When it arrived, I knew I was all in. Yes sir, this was, is the Tablet of all Tablets to beat. Now hear this, I love Samsung as a company and have a Galaxy S20+ 5G phone made by  them. Only 1 year old. I just love that SAMOLED display. I love the speed. I did not just love, well, anything else. Google dropped a very large, heavy ball when they neglected to focus on Tablet Apps. Mostly, at about 85% the Android apps are written with no regard or monitoring, for a 7 inch screen. The New iPad Pro has a 12.9 in screen, so no, that just wont work. Samsung battles on, producing some of the very first finest tablets and smartphones to come to market. Most of the other vendors have given up. Asus and LG were the last two standing next to Samsung. They just could not compete. That ended within the last few years but like I mentioned earlier, Samsung pushed on! I am the proud owner of a very nice Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 11in. in ALL of its beauty and speed. Photos look great, movies have deep blacks and general content is certainly better than just fine. The problem is, its a phone. It\u2019s a 7in. by 2.5in. phone, and its still using phone apps. You should understand that when your the last in line holding that Tablet, you NEED to rely on what\u2019s right in front of you. That great display just cannot provide the much needed app content to match the iPad. Myself, I am a convert. I was dead set against Apple for many years. Then came my 2019 MacBook Pro 15. I want to stress this point please\u2026 I was and still am so enamored by the amazing (non-touch) beautiful LED display, the raw power of Intels Quad Core  i7, the 512gb SSD and of course the 16GB of 4th gen. onboard RAM. To this day, I STILL very much love that Apple laptop. It rarely fails me, its always updated and \u201coh my\u201d that screen is just gorgeous! No Windows based laptop could compete. Not my Microsoft Surface Pro 7, not my Dell Inspiron 4K UHD monster touch screen laptop. None of them could compete. I was transformed into a Mac lover. For sure I did not set out to be one, but I can proudly say today, I am. As technology advances at a blistering fast pace, one needs to keep up or, be left in the dust. That is exactly when and where the iPad Pro comes in. An amazingly fast laptop M1 processor, 256GB SSD, 8GB Dual Channel 5th Gen RAM. A touch screen that begs to be touched. Accessories albeit overpriced designed for a specific Tablet. There is no shortage OR doubt that Apple is making more money than ever hand over fist. The benefit to that is that so much of that money goes in to R & D (Research & Development). Picture this, if you will, a boardroom with 22 fine Corinthian leather chairs seated around a huge Mahogany board room table. Fast forward and Apple CEO\u2019s and CFO\u2019s tell the lucky 20 others at the end of that meeting this. \u201cWe think we have a true winner here. We want you to take these home and live with them, for 2 weeks minimum to a month maximum.\u201d The meeting closes and the lucky 20 walk out with what will eventually become the 12.9 2021 iPad Pro. After a month, they are all brought back in to that meeting room. They discuss all the (mainly Pros) and Cons. Small improvements here, a few deletions there and then we have it. That laptop replacement I spoke about in the start of this review. Yes, you can have your cake AND eat it too. The attention to build quality detail is practically flawless. The utter speed of that Apple designed and implemented M1 Processor. The mind blowing mini LED screen that rivals that from LG OLED HDTVs.  This tablet will take your breath away. You will be transformed in to a lover of everything iPad. There is far too much to much too list in one Amazon review. It would not be fair for me to try to cram EVERYTHING into one hand written, typed review. These are Amazon Reviews and should not be the length of a book or you will pass the review by for a few shorter ones. To all of you that made it this far in my review, I applaud you. Thank you for hanging in there! That is exactly Apples philosophy. Make darn sure every 20 members in that room are unanimous. A very resounding YES, we hit the ball right on the screws and it has left the ballpark. More balls come and they too get smashed out of the park. Is it unfair for Apple to have this much leverage and without a doubt over-charge the consumer in return for pure, unbridled greatness? Probably. Let me finish with this please\u2026Most of us work very hard for a paycheck, salary, fee or whatever. It is all Green in the end. Picture this\u2026 Two tablets are sitting in front of you and you are practically drooling over those displays. Your feel like you\u2019ve seen this movie before. The software opens up. You look down, then back up as you contemplate all those pros and cons surrounding a 12.9 in iPad Pro and a 12 in Samsung Galaxy S7 Pro. Same price! The decision may not be so easy, but I will add one more piece to this puzzle that was missing. The operating System and the 1 Million or so apps made SPECIFICALLY for an Apple Tablet screen.  IPad is on the right, Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 on the left. Same price. Which one are you going to be confident of that your hard earned green is placed in the proper pocket? They both boot up and the screens are stunning and just blow you away. Then the dust settles and you are all alone (*in your head). Be honest here, when and if you have that choice between 2 of the best Tablets. Not Laptop PCs doing double duty as a tablet and PC. No. This is a contest between 2 of the very best Tablets in the world! Which one would you pull the trigger on. The Android Version convoluted with unknown device software that varies SO MUCH from device to device, A somewhat confusing Windows 10 Pro that may or may be not \u201cup to date\u201d with proper antivirus software, a necessity! Or do you look at the iPad in the middle with the Magic Keyboard or Logitech keyboard case. You look left, you look right, then you look back again to front and center at that very New 2021 very large 12.9 in screen that cries out to just be touched. Which device will you choose>? Are you going to remain an uninspired Apple hater, or are you all wrapped up in Windows? At this point, Android has left the building. Windows 10 Pro hangs in there against iPad OS 14.5. Two tablets left. I look to the left, then to the right. I am sweating now and my heart is racing. Which one is begging me to \u201cfuture proof\u201d and buy into the whole operating system experience? Yes, this actually happened to me. A very long time Microsoft PC and laoptop owner. A lover of Samsung Galaxy Pro PHONES. And then I cave. To realize all that money could bestow my love but too needing to choose one device in the now, and  one in the end. That device is the 2021 iPad Pro 12.9. Exploring all it can do every day learning something new I feel invigorated. My inspiration for a Tablet (and a keyboard) cries out to be touched and learned. I am excited, frustrated, a long deep breath as I work through this NEW \u201clearning experience\u201d second to none. Yes, the 2021 iPad Pro LED 12.9 inch display takes my breath away. Be it pure geek/beast mode now. Then, at that very moment when I hand over my credit card I know\u2026I know in my gut I made the right decision. That decision, again, is that 12.9 2021 iPad Pro. I have arrived and there is no looking back. One and done. My confidence returns and I am practically begging to learn more. This is my true story. I hope I helped someone, anyone! To understand just how difficult that One Grand gets spent. Apple gets richer and its back to the boardroom because there is talk of a new M1X chip. The tablet has not even arrived at your front door and Apple is already back in that boardroom discussing the near and far future of Apple Devices. The line blurs. Is it a Tablet or a Laptop? I will leave it up to YOU to make that decision! Remember this please, enjoy your purchase and learn all about it. Get the very most out of that big purchase. Your future you will thank you.\n"]},

The CPU is not the best when compared to the Ryzen 9 5900HS, or 11th Gen i9; however, the fact that the M1 Pro CPU can deliver great performance (which rivals the competition) and be highly power efficient, is a Big Plus.

I'm more a casual user, so the full power and potential features of this laptop will never be used by me. So why would I spend a whopping $2,500 on a 16-inch laptop? Two reasons, my old 2012 MacBook Pro has reached obsolesce and after December 2021 Apple will no longer support it (no more security updates). Secondly, I am heavily into the Apple ecosystem. iPad, iPhone, iMac and I really like how all my devices work together seamlessly. Also, I'm an older guy (euphemism for senior citizen) and I really like and prefer a larger screen size on my laptop as opposed to portability. Having got all that out of the way, let me share this, this laptop is AMAZING. The screen display is incredibly sharp with vivid colors. It has a comfortable keyboard with good backlighting. The very large glass track pad is very responsive, and Apple's software is excellent at palm rejection, so your resting hands do not interfere when your typing. The sound output through the speakers is very, very impressive, almost unbelievable for laptop. The laptop's aluminum frame is solid. It is a big, bulky laptop, so if you're on the go and looking for a laptop to lug around everyday, I recommend you look at the 13-inch Mac laptops. Buying a laptop at this price range is a huge investment and I recommend that potential buyers do their due diligence and compare features and costs of both Macs and Windows PCs, especially if you're not in the Apple ecosystem. But, If, however you want a larger 16-inch screen and a Mac laptop then your choices will be the 2020 (Intel) or 2021 MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) and of the two, I recommend the M1 Pro version. Once I got over the sticker shock, I really am very happy with my 2021 MacBook. My recommendation? Two thumbs up!\n"]},

That alone is the best aspect.", "Dumb drawbacks:", "- The Paintbrush program, arguably the most simple and unsophisticated program on the Macbook, has a bug/flaw where I cannot add text to a new project without the program closing.

I couldn't remove + re-add the program either, since it's a fixed Mac program in the hardware. So I downloaded some other random paint-type program from the app store. Just dumb.", "- The lack of USB-A ports is incredibly stupid and an inconvenience. It's so obvious that Mac just wants to make money off of selling their adapters. One might argue this isn't a big deal, but I never had to deal with adapters on the Macbook Pro 2015. So the fact that I've paid a fortune for this new computer and I don't have a functional Paintbrush program + need to use adapters now is just inconvenient and dumb, considering how much time and technology goes into these computers. It's like, why inconvenience people?", "- I needed to purchase new subscriptions to various programs in order to use them on my new computer. For example, I had a Microsoft Word license on the 2015 Macbook. But it wouldn't carry over to the 2021 computer. If you had purchased a one-off license for use on one device instead of an online yearly subscription, you'll find you have to re-purchase Microsoft 365. A couple other programs also didn't work and I had to re-purchase and download.", "I give the computer 4 stars because of these inconveniences in comparison to the price.

The display can do HDR content with sustained 1000 nits and peak 1600 nits brightness. Supposedly, regular SDR content shows at the same 500 nits max as prior models, but subjectively the display does seem brighter and bolder than the 2019.", "Apple says that the speakers and keyboard have been improved vs the Intel 2019 model, while the touchpad remains the same. The keyboard is visibly different--black instead of unpainted metal in between the keys--but structurally is still part of the unibody. Apple overstated the improvements in the keynote, but its certainly no worse than the Magic Keyboards used on the 2019 Intel model, and I do think there is more key travel and a bit more key noise than the 2019 MBP 16. The speakers are likewise just as good as before, and I do think they have a bit more power to them. They can easily rival my HomePod mini stereo pair for listening to music at my desk.", "If you are on the Internet at all, you already know that this years models removed the Touch Bar and added a display notch. The thing is, it makes more sense to say they added rabbit ears because the notch area was always non-display, it just used to be part of the bezel. It only takes a small amount of menu bar space (if you are worried about that, I recommend Bartender 4 which can restore the old menu bar spacing and hide unneeded items). As for Touch Bar, I feel kind of bad for the few developers who really put a lot of time into it, but it clearly didn't take off and didn't make sense to keep investing in it. There were a few things I really liked such as the emoji picker (though it often froze while scrolling)", "On another note, the FaceTime camera is drastically improved (now 1080p) and among the best in a laptop. but still weak compared to an iPhone or iPad. Now that there is a dedicated notch area for camera space, I wish Apple would but the best-in-class cameras it already knows how to make on the Mac. Even the massive 12.9\" iPad Pro has the cameras from the iPhone now, so the Mac could too. I haven't tested the mics, but the marketing language is exactly the same as in 2019 so I doubt there are any substantive changes to the design.", "Oh, and did I mention this laptop is SILENT. Like seriously, I have not heard the fans turn on yet. My Intel Mac was constantly running them and was too hot for bare legs during everyday web browsing, let alone anything \"pro.\"", "I am definitely satisfied with the purchase, and I will come back to upload some photos when I get home.\n"]},

If you buy used like I did, the previous owner could have enabled lost mode, and will transmit location data to their Apple ID; be careful when buying used vs. new. Other than that, they have clean sound in the high and mid-range, but bass could be increased a moderate bit.

Apple wants $550 to fix each one of them, but I can't even send them in for repair because Apple requires you to erase the device before sending it for repair. With the broken USB-C port, I can no longer charge the iPad to power it on, let alone erase it- even through my account on Apple's website.

The new Pro does NOT support split keyboard which I have used since iOS 5, nearly 10 years. I find the new keyboard layout unusable. It is natural to hold the iPad in landscape position with thumbs on the sides but now the bezel is so small that your thumbs interact with the screen also rendering the device unusable. They expect you to use this with an iPhone style one-hand keyboard but after 10 years of using thumbs in split keyboard, this phone-style \"floating\" keyboard (if you can even call it that) is impossible. I bought from Apple store and returned it after 5 days of frustration. This is not the same class of device as ones with home button, this new kind is for quasi-desktop replacement, not for kicking back in your comfy chair and surfing, watching vids, playing chess, etc. I wanted Pro for the audio upgrade 4 speaker stereo.

I came from the 2018 and only bought this because my 2018 Pro screen was cracked, no longer on Apple Care and starting to not respond properly to the touch screen.  And I noticed the speed bump.  No - IOS 15 won't turn this thing into a laptop, but that's why Apple sells MacBooks and no amount of hoping will change that fact.  Is the M1 overkill for an iPad?

{"profile-name": "T-ACCT", "review-star-rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I had been eyeing a new iPad to replace my aging Air 2. Originally I was going to go with the Air 4, but the cost of the base-level Pro (11-inch, 128 GB) is only slightly more expensive than the 256 GB Air model. I felt like it was worth getting more powerful and future-proof hardware than extra storage (especially with cloud storage and USB options).", "I\u2019ve only been using the Pro for about a month and I can definitely confirm it\u2019s powerful. I thought the Air 2 was a fast tablet, but the speed of the Pro is unbelievable. Apps open almost instantly, 3D scanning takes seconds, and even editing massive RAW photos in Lightroom was seamless. I haven\u2019t tried to push the iPad to its limits, but so far nothing in my regular graphic design workflow has caused any kind of slowdown.", "The battery life is also a major upgrade from my earlier iPad. I\u2019m used to having to plug in my devices at the end of the day (or several times throughout the day in the case of my Windows laptop), but at the end of the day my Pro still has anywhere from 30-60 percent battery left. That\u2019s with web browsing, drawing with Procreate, answering emails, etc. The battery does take a bigger hit with 3D and AR applications, but that\u2019s nothing unusual.", "I also love the screen of the iPad Pro. The 11-inch model doesn\u2019t have the brand new HDR display that Apple advertises, but it\u2019s still vibrant and bright. More importantly, the 120 HZ refresh rate really does make for a smoother experience. Drawing on the screen with the Apple Pencil is an absolute joy, and even just navigating around iPadOS with the faster refresh rate feels better. It\u2019s hard to go back to the regular screen on the Air 2.", "The downside to the latest hardware is that, while it\u2019s incredible, the iPad feels limited by the current state of iPadOS. While I\u2019ve fallen in love with using the iPad for graphic design projects, it still doesn\u2019t have the pro-level apps that are on PC. Designers expecting a complete laptop replacement will probably be disappointed. Even so, iOS has plenty of unique apps that make the iPad a perfect companion to PCs and Macs. Procreate is my new favorite drawing app, and I\u2019m discovering all sorts of unique apps that take advantage of the Pencil and AR capabilities. The iPad is really in a class of its own, it can do things that no PC (including the Surface) is capable of.", "Overall, the new Pro hardware is probably a bit overkill in most situations right now. In terms of being future-proof, however, I can see it being well worth the money. This is the kind of hardware that will presumably last for years, and I\u2019d expect that the app situation and iPadOS limitations will improve significantly once developers begin to take advantage of the M1 chip. The other iPad models are more than adequate right now (especially the Air 4), but anyone looking for the best iPad experience should definitely consider the Pro. I\u2019m absolutely in love with using mine.\n"]},

I found the deal on Amazon, with a discount due to Father\u2019s Day and I believe a Memorial Day sale. Purchasing this iPad has been a great thing. As a college student, I take this everywhere I go. It is very light weight, and a very smart device. Once I turned it on, it connected with my apple account and set up my apple wallet. I use this device for taking notes, watching videos, and listening to music. The speakers on this thing are great. The color is fine, a little light. I recommend purchasing the Apple Pencil right off as it goes extremely well, and along with a screen protector. Overall, I am so content with being able to have purchased this device.

Screen and image quality.....well if you compare it to my 8yr old Samsung galaxy tab, well there is nothing to compare really.This ipad outshines it. My cousin who is an apple nut says that its super impressive. My issue now is moving things such as photos from the Galaxy tab. Its definitely doable but its also not as simple as one would think if you don\u2019t have a pc with the itunes installed (which I do not). I have no need for a pc. ....yet.\n"]},

That means there is no real way to adjust the color settings or whiteness of the screen.  You can with the Galaxy S7 and S7+.  The picture on the Galaxy, especially the S7+ is far superior with crisp colors and white whites.  You can also adjust it warmer or cooler, but not with the iPad.  The sound from the iPad Air 4 is a real problem.  It is bright with a high amount of sibilance (hissing Ss) when people speak.  The problem is, unlike the Galaxy, there is no available EQ app that works across the board from everything from movies to Pandora.  They all try to direct you to Spotify and Apple Music.  There are many other services.  With the Galaxy, the EQ works for all.  The iPad speed Air 4 speed is very good, but for me, that is where it ends.\n"]},

First being the weight, it\u2019s very light and can be held with one hand easily. Secondly the bezels are a little larger than the iPad Pro which to me is a step in the right direction. The reason being is that it gives your palm space to grip the side without covering the edge of the display. Third of all it\u2019s got some decent sounding speakers for what they are. And last but not least the display is very sharp and has great color accuracy. I hope that Apple considers this bezel design for the iPad Pro because it\u2019s definitely much better for holding in the hand. This iPad Air was a great buy and I definitely will be holding onto it for years to come!\n"]},

Pity. 2) That infamous jelly scroll defect. Let me put it straight. Some people pay more attention to it while some less but ! To whatever degree of discomfort it causing it is simply unacceptable to have neither in portrait nor in landscape orientation. I only paid attention to it on my 3d day of use but now i can see it every time and it is simply disturbing and infuriating to have on the new 500$ device. Huge letdown from Apple who with their usual arrogance will not acknowledge it neither will issue recall or even care to redesign it. They already said that it is normal behavior !!! Ha! Simply bad engineering decision by putting screen controller on the wrong side of the screen making it good for landscape use only! Looks like Cupertino have some serious brain drain there.

The left portion (in portrait) of the screen refreshes at a slower rate than the right, causing content to distort when animating, or most notably, when scrolling. This is currently present on all units (I confirmed by going to the Apple store and all 5 units I inspected had the issue as well) - Once you see it your can't unsee it. I find the iTunes store app to give a great demonstration of how bad it can be, with all of the small square content pieces distorting into obvious skewed angles and trapezoids. Hopefully Apple can fix the issue with a graphics driver update, but theres still a chance it's caused by a hardware configuration issue. I've been waiting for this form factor for a long time, so this is a major disappointment. The device is great otherwise, as advertised, but this screen distortion gives me a headache and I'll likely return the tablet if Apple doesn't find a fix. It ruins it.\n"]},

{"profile-name": "Garrison", "review-star-rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  For clarification: I purchased these on Apple.com. I am just posting my review here.", "When you take these headphones out of the box you immediately notice the weight. Seeing as they are made of mostly metal, besides the replaceable ear cups and headband, this is not too surprising. The metal gives these headphones a very premium feel. The removable ear cups are very soft and comfortable and also easily replaceable (connected via magnets).", "The comfort of these headphones rivals most of the other headphones that I own or have owned. I have been comparing these to my Pioneer DJ HDJ-X10s and my Sennheiser PXC 550-IIs. The pioneer headphones are made for long listening sessions and DJ sets and the new Apple headphones tend to be more comfortable than those. When I initially got them I had them on for over 5 hours without any discomfort. Also, a common problem with some over ear headphones is that your ear my start to get hot or sweat over time. That has not been a problem with these headphones. The ear cups are not made out of a non-breathable leather which I am assuming is the reason why my ears do not heat up or sweat over time. The mesh at the top of the headband aids in the comfort. The other thing that makes these comfortable is the various adjustment points. From the telescoping arms to the ball point hinges, you can get an almost perfect fit for your head shape.", "Now let's talk about the sound quality. I will fist start off by stating that the noise cancelation, compared to the PXC 550-II is significantly better. It does not completely cancel out all noise however, it does a better job. I think. this is due to the metal design and the mass amount of microphones that they have located in various location on the headphones. When you use the transparency mode these microphones really shine! When this mode is active, and no music is playing, I can clearly hear myself as if I did not have the headphones on at all! Very impressive hardware and software magic from Apple. When actually playing music, in my opinion, the quality rivals a large selection of over ear headphones expect the high end audiophile range. The lows are not muddy and the mids and highs come through very crisp. The clarity is most likely due to the fact that the headphone boasts a 40mm driver which is large enough to reproduce a wide range of frequencies at high volumes without distortion or clipping.", "I am a big fan of the tactile buttons and Digital Crown that they have on the headphones for control. This control interface is simple and easy to learn and use daily. The noise cancelation button allows you to cycle between the various noise cancelation modes and in the software you can choose which of the three modes it cycles between (see image). Te Digital Crown is exactly like what you will find on the Apple Watch, only bigger. Scrolling on the watch allows for volume control, and clicking allows for play/pause.", "Using these headphones with Apple devices is pretty much as expected, seamless. I will say that you will need to ensure that you devices are updated to the latest operating system in order to fully enjoy all of the features.", "Battery life so far is very good! The smart case helps maintain battery life when not in use. From regular use I can go about three days before I need to charge them again. Now that is not travel days. If you travel a lot you may have to charge them more often. Everyones use case is different.", "Let me talk about the things that I don't like about these headphones. FYI these may be just personal gripes and might not bother you nor do they take away from the function of the headphones. The first issue that I have is that Apple is still trying to hold onto the lighting charging port. I really wish the would have put a USB C charging port on these headphones bringing them into the rapidly forming universal charging world that is here. The second gripe I have is with the case. If you look at the images I provided you can see how there are gaps in the case. This bothers me slightly because if I were to put these in my backpack on my daily commute there is a chance that something could slip in and scratch the ear cups. Now, I will see if this happens over time but it was not something that I had to deal with with my PXC 550-II because the case for those was completely covering of the headphones.", "I will add to this review overtime as use these headphones more...\n"]},

I found myself listening to some clean & pristine music within minutes of connecting.", "My first piece, as a sample was Allegri's MISERERE by the Tallis Scholars. It's an a cappella piece from the 1630s. I like to use this track that's over 12 minutes because it is a perfect example of the headphones ability to handle silence.

From an aesthetics perspective the AirPods Max are on an entirely different level. The ear muffs are super soft aluminum with just the right amount of shine. For the most part the NC700s are plastic construction, which isn\u2019t quite as remarkable but does make possible the much lighter overall weight. Confessions from an audiophile - the AirPods Max deliver on every metric i care about. These are high quality headphones that will have you rediscovering the music you thought you knew inside and out.

{"profile-name": "Paul from Berkeley", "review-star-rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I bought the Max online from Apple directly and picked it up at the local Apple store. I returned it the following week to the local Apple store. Apple hasn't asked me for any comments but someone on Amazon may find what I experienced helpful.", "My impressions of the Apple Max headphones are not comprehensive. They apply to the one feature that to me is the most important for headphones: sound reproduction and its fidelity to the original. That doesn't mean that comfort and ease of use don't matter, but once those are acceptable, then where do we go?", "There's good coordination with Airplay and Apple watch and an easy set up - all as you would expect from Apple. I didn't use the active noise canceling feature but passive noise canceling is excellent: I put on the Max, turned on my noisy space heater, and had to test the heat with my fingers to see that it was on.", "You place the cans on your head and they're up and running. The bass is rich and the highs are decent but, unless they are singled out in the music, they are obscured by the wall of mid: high mid, low mid, and the vast, rich, middle range. There's nice spatial separation and presence but the music never experiences silence. When music stops, at the end of a note or a measure, for example, even for an instant, there is a pause but it is at the same level of energy as the music which preceded and follows it. With good reproduction you will hear, where it is appropriate, silence - you will hear it, and it will be satisfying. Here you are never satisfied. With a good system the music speaks, there is a crispness of expression, there are overtones, there is nuance; with these headphones the music slurs. The Apple headphones don't breathe, the air just flows, on and on - this is elevator music, pleasant elevator music, true, and, perhaps, if you just want something to while away the time, sufficient. Despite the supreme comfort of these cans the listening experience for me is unfulfilling and tedious - and it makes me sad to see such potential (and these are quite special devices) wasted.", "I have high-end high impedance open-back headphones and a good (trans)portable amp which I use most of the time. It isn't noise canceling (it's open-back) and it's wired. I would have liked the Max as an alternative choice for cafe and travel. I love the idea of wireless but I'm partial to good reproduction and to have my music (mostly classical) sound as close as possible to the original thing. I did alternate the Max with this system but there was no intention of comparing - especially after I listened to what the Max had to say.", "I tried another tack. I have a decent midrange closed back headphone, low impedance and plugged directly into the 3.5 mm headphone jack on my 6s; not noise canceling but it's got a close ear fit and I've enjoyed listening to it on airplanes - price: $150. I feel like I've stepped off the elevator and into a concert hall. There are instruments being played not far away and I'm thrilled by what I'm hearing. When I listen to the same music with the Max, I hear sound - finely processed sound on a large stage - but I don't hear an instrument playing; I hear a technician's take on what that instrument might sound like: it's close but it's not in the same ballpark.\n"]},

So if you aren't used to heavy clamping, you may get headaches from wearing these.", "-One of my biggest gripes: the sound is nowhere as crisp as I was anticipating based on reviews. I found the mids and vocals to be receded which was very surprising. I expected the sound quality to be above and beyond any headset I've owned. That was just not the case. This is something that can be tweaked in a firmware push.", "-The customization level of the EQ is a fraction if its competition (Sony XM4 gives excellent EQ customization for half the price as an example).", "-I have the same issue with the airpod pros in that the pressure on the ears from noise cancellation gives me headaches. This one depends on the user, but despite the earphones themselves being comfortable, the pressure from the cups cause headaches.", "When all is said and done, I am a person that focuses entirely on value. These simply don't sound like they are 550 dollar + tax headphones to me. The sound quality just isn't there. They don't sound bad per say, just not at that price range. I would say a more fair price for them would be around $400. Now the material is excellent and the noise cancellation is also excellent. So if that is very important to you, these may be exactly what you want. But nonetheless I would anticipate some refinements for the 2nd generation, or a price drop in the future to something more competitive in the mid $400 dollar range. I ended up returning these because bottom line is I did not find the price to match the sound quality, and they were not comfortable for long term use.\n"]},

I'm having trouble warming up to their sound. Yes, they sound clearer and have more realistic bass than the XM4's, but I think I might prefer the Sony's anyway. Their sound is just warmer and more enjoyable for music. Remember when it comes to music, \"accuracy\" isn't the only thing. CD's are more accurate than vinyl, yet many vastly prefer the sound of vinyl anyway. These to me sound just a bit cold and sterile. I hope I change my mind.

Apple products, back in the day, were supposed to be simple, logical and easy to use, but the functionality of these is not good.  My biggest grip is the controls.  The AirPods have a small sensor strip on each bud that can be used to turn the noise cancellation on or off, to pause music, or to go move to the next track or prior track.  That's it, and the controls cannot be changed in the AirPods Pro.  On my other earbuds (the Jabra elite), I can customize the controls, and I can also use the buds to change the volume.  I can't believe that the AirPods can't be customized.  Crazy.  More seriously, the sensor strip is EXTREMELY difficult to use.  My Jabras have a button on each bud that is incredibly easy to press, even 9 miles into a run.  The AirPods?  There is this small metal sensor strip that has to be pressed just right.  The only way to do it is to sort of pinch the earbud, pressing the strip with one finger while holding the back of the AirPod stalk so that it doesn't fall out.  This is not easy, and I find it a nightmare in running.  I end up pulling the stupid AirPods out by accident just trying to move forward a track.  I can't believe Apple thought this was a good control scheme.  On the positive size, the fit for me is perfect, and the AirPods are light.  The sounds quality is good too ---- the Jabras sound noticeably better with music, but the call quality on the AirPods seems a bit better than the Jabras.

If your on a longer trip I\u2019d recommend bringing a power bank.

Lastly, and most importantly, after this product connected with my spouses iPhone 12Mini, it did not recognize the iPhone and thus, did not work or play music from the Air Pods!

{"profile-name": "Impetigo", "review-star-rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I like these headphones a lot overall but here is the breakdown (I got it from the local Apple Store):", "GOOD:", "- APPLE ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION: You will definitely like these more the greater your integration with the Apple ecosystem.  That is, if you have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook/iMac, Apple TV, etc. you will find these headphones to work seamlessly and flawlessly overall.  I love that it automatically pairs with my iPhone when it's next to it even if it was last connected to my Apple TV or iMac/MBA.  I love how I can check the battery life on my iPhone or Mac notification bar or widgets.  Pairing, connecting, etc. is a breeze with other Apple products.  Never have a problem connecting to any of my Apple devices, which is unlike every other wireless/bluetooth headphone/earphone I've ever used (from Sony, Bose, Beats).  I love using this with my Apple TVs, Macs (MacBook Airs, iMacs), iPad, and iPhone.", "- GOOD AESTHETIC & FUNCTIONAL DESIGN: I don't love it, but I think they look nice overall.  I love the cool, smooth metal used on the cans, even if it does add some weight.  I like how all the controls are on the R can and not split between the two.  I like the digital crown for volume and pause/start.  I like the button for toggling noise cancellation modes.", "- SOUND QUALITY: They sound good, but not noticeably better than my older Beats Studio Wireless cans.  Bass response is good if you like your bass.  But they also don't have problems connecting via bluetooth every other time I use them like the Beats so that more than makes up for it.", "THE BAD:", "- COST: Yeah, it's the \"Apple tax.\"  Love it or hate it, all Apple products come with them.", "- NO WALL ADAPTER: I really hate how Apple has stopped including AC wall adapters with their recent products.  This only comes with a lightning to USB-C cable.", "THE NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD:", "- BATTERY LIFE: It may not be the best in class but it is decent (but not great).  I think 10 hours per charge (using noise cancellation or \"transparency\" mode) is a stretch though.  More like 6 hours or so.", "- COMFORT: It is neither super comfortable nor uncomfortable.  The cans are taller than wide so depending on your ear shape you may find it more or less comfortable for extended periods of time.  I find them to be too narrow and get tiring on my ears after using them for a while, but it gets better with some adjustment.  I also find the design of the arch over the head part to be not terribly comfortable, with the flexible mesh between the parallel bars being not that comfortable (can't press them down as the mesh doesn't keep the bars from pressing on your head).", "- CASE: I think the \"bra/handbag\" case gets a lot of undeserved hate.  It is obviously not intended to be a travel case, simply a case to keep the headphones in battery conservation mode (if you have AirPods you know how fast those suckers lose their battery if left outside their charging case).  A case that could charge the phone inside it is not feasible, nor is a wireless charging design.  It just wouldn't work.  But for what it is designed to do -- keep it clean and in battery saving mode -- it does the job and is totally fine.  What I don't like is how the cutout for the lightning cable is a quarter inch off from where the port would be, which is annoying as I can't easily plug in the cord without causing some tension on the port due to the case getting in the way.", "- LIGHTNING PORT: I don't mind this that much since I have so many lightning cables, but USB-C probably would have made more sense.", "OVERALL:  These really only make sense for people who have numerous Apple devices as it doesn't really justify the price otherwise.  But if you are fully invested in the Apple ecosystem, then it is well worth the price.  I have AirPod Pros and find them to be complementary to each other, and I love having them both.\n"]},
{"profile-name": "Christopher S. Cornette", "review-star-rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  Purchased from the Apple Store.  Initial assessment is truly outstanding, especially for anyone using Apple devices (iPhone, Macs, Apple TV).  The sound quality is superb within their class, far more natural sounding than Beats, Bose, Sony.  I've got 30 years as a professional musician, and I really have to use my pro grade reference headphones to get better sound, but those are all wired and most cost more than these do.  The noise cancellation is where these things really shine.  I've used Bose QC and Sony's best NC headphones, and the APM noise cancellation is faster and better than those, and the transparency mode sounds truly natural - as if you aren't wearing headphones at all - and switching back and forth is easy to do.  If you use Apple devices, you'll be very pleased with the quick seamless control over your devices, and how easily it switches between devices (a real pain with some of the top competition's headphones).", "Now for the bad... and it's really bad.  These things were clearly put out before they were ready for release.  I'm currently waiting on my SECOND repair/replace in less than six months.  My first pair worked well for about six weeks, then started getting really finicky about connecting, then starting switching noise cancelation modes all by itself, then completely lost the ability to connect or reboot/reset.  So I called Apple.  I don't live near an Apple Store, so they sent me a return box that took two weeks to arrive.  I sent them in, and it took a week for them to even start the repair, and a couple more couple days for them to decide the repair was impossible and send me a new pair.  Great!  Until two weeks later when the brand new pair suddenly refused to wake up (come out of sleep mode) and could not be rebooted or reset.  So now I'm waiting on another return box to arrive.  Researching the discussion boards, I can tell you I am far from alone in this experience.", "And notice, I haven't even gotten around to the lack of a power on/off option.  These headphones \"sleep\" in ultra-low power mode, but NEVER actually turn off.  AND then there's the included \"case\" which is not a case, but a slip cover that leaves all the corner edges exposed, which are the most likely to be scratched or hit.  All the slip cover does is put the headphones to sleep and give partial scratch protection (but NO impact protection).  If you buy these, or already have a pair, invest in a 3rd party smart case.", "Bottom line, buying the first generation of this product is a crapshoot.  You may get a lemon, but the warranty should give you time to figure that out and get a working model, even if it takes a few tries, and when these things work as intended, they are, in my opinion, the best consumer Bluetooth over-ear noise cancelling headphones on the market, especially for apple device users.  Sincerely, they kick butt, right up until they don't.", "I sincerely hope they get the bugs worked out for v 2.0.

After 3 + hours of test run, it feels very comfortable and not hurting my ears..that\u2019s the biggest surprise.", "4th: build quality, it\u2019s absolutely great material with metal and aluminum, where most of the weight are made of. However the ear cups bang into each other when you\u2019re taking off the smart case, which might scratch or damage the ear cups long term. You can buy earscups protector, which extra $15 at Amazon.", "Now the negative..there are few of them..1. No on or off bottom, which mean your Max will slowly drain in battery. Even you put in the smart case..there are rumors some Max are draining faster than other. Mine is draining very slowly..so I lucked out. 2. Condensation issue. Some Max users reported that their Max have condensation issue when water or sweat get into inside the ear cups causing damage to the drivers. Once the drivers are damage it\u2019s unfixable therefore Max shouldn\u2019t be used for exercise. Yes, I did use for my exercise but I didn\u2019t sweat much. No Apple logo on the Max, which I find that to be insulting and infuriating..$550 and other people can\u2019t tell which brand i am wearing. Bad advertisement from Apple. Last but least the smart case, which is without the doubt the worst case of any kind in human civilization history. You can buy $20 to 100 ( Waterfield ) cases. No power charger, that\u2019s another $20. Wish the battery is bit longer. 20 hours is barely acceptable. With constant battery drainage I\u2019ve to charge Max every 3 day.", "For the first generation of Apple overhead headphones it has pluses and minuses..all and I all I lucked on all the negatives  and get all the positive..I give Max\u2019s very impressive 9.8 out of 10 because it\u2019s very comfortable, overall impressive sound and top notch build quality, even its few minus faults.", "I recommend to anyone who appreciate great sound quality and have enough money to buy them.\n"]},

The presentation of the mids is super clean and smooth without sounding harsh and fatiguing. This leads to very good instrument separation, clarity, and texture. A lot of boomy bass headphones have a lot of bass which may be fun at first, but it ends up muddying everything up so you can hear the bass, but you can\u2019t feel the quality of the bass (the harmonic distortion that gives bass it\u2019s character) and all songs end up sounding the same. With these, you can fully hear the bass to very low frequencies, but it\u2019s not muddied at all so you can really get a sense for the texture and quality of the bass. This is very noticeable in hip hop songs where 808 bass lines all have a certain quality on them or a Tool song where the bassist has raw analog distortion on the bass track, something that is harder to hear on lesser quality headphones/speakers.", "One great feature is that they sound great at low volumes too. A lot of headphones you have to turn up to a \u201cfun\u201d level before you can really hear the detail or get interested in the sound, but by that point you\u2019re damaging your hearing. These stay balanced and engaging throughout the volume range.", "When I have these on and go about my work, I don\u2019t think about what the headphones sound like, I just hear the music.

I own every pair of Apple headphones. I lost one ear piece to each and I\u2019ve been relaying on these bad boys and let me tell you it kinda sucks. That\u2019s what brings me to this review section. I been spending a lot of quality time with these things so i think my opinion is valid. I like them but if you don\u2019t have the money don\u2019t buy them. You won\u2019t use them that much to validate the purpose unless there is a really good reason you want these. I use them on the plane too. I hate putting them in my book bag because they don\u2019t fold so i just feel like they are so exposed. That case does nothing but protect the aluminum and make sure the headphones are off. I use the Sony headphones too. they have a hard protective case. I like that a lot better. I will be honest and say i use these way more because i have everything Apple but they piss me off because i always come back to the thought. These aren\u2019t worth the price even though they\u2019re good headphones. I just shouldn\u2019t have these worries if i paid $600 for headphones. That\u2019s just me though! But y\u2019all have a good day! Hope you enjoyed my real view, i mean review! :D\n"]},

Construction quality is evident with top-notch materials, tolerances, look/feel, etc.  Although some reviews are negative regarding comfort, I found them to be fine.

My take is that the primary function of this case is to provide minimal protection while serving to put the headphones into low power mode.  Since I don't plan on taking the headphones out of the house, it's fine for me.  If I were to travel with these, or throw them in a backpack, I would put them in a lined zipper bag, or something similar.

I don't mind paying a premium for Apple's typically high quality construction, ease of integration with other Apple devices, attention to detail, packaging, etc., but $549 is pushing it.

It took months to deliver, and during the interim I thought many times about canceling the order.  Why? Well, the first thing is it worth the astronomical cost, and especially when compared to a benchmark set such as the Sony WH-XB900N/B ($248 on good ole Amazon)?  The answer is a definitive \"No!\"  The Apple AirPods Max are grossly over priced.  Any intelligent buyer would want to compare the \"specs.\"  For instance, what are the frequency response, THD, etc. that virtually every high-end pair of headphones provide.  Apple supplies no specs and when I asked Customer Service for them for comparative reasons, I was told that they weren't available. The only comparison is therefore subjective. The AirPods Max came well packaged - an Apple hallmark.  Instructions were not only scant, but written in a faint gray color and in a font size that even an eagle would have challenges discerning. The controls for adjusting the tonal qualities are absent too.  The ear cushions are very comfortable, but after about 30 minutes become very warm.  The headphone are also among the heaviest due to their metal construction, which give a solid feel. The mesh headband is also innovative and very comfortable.  Coupled with the right and left adjustments, they are a pleasure to wear for extended periods.  A variety of colors are offered too, but I went with the space gray and later ordered the red cushions ($69), and yes the price includes both right and left cushions as the Apple ad is vague on that matter.  Overall sound reproduction is above average, but not stellar. The Sennheiser Momentum 3 headphones, in my opinion, are far better as are the Sony XB900, and they are significantly less expensive.  The battery life is very good thus far and has approached 17 hours before needing to be re-charged.  Apple advertises 20 hours. Part of Apple's promo is free engraving on the AirPods Max, which I requested.  They arrived sans engraving.  Customer Service informed me that it was apparently a common error, and offered to provide a full refund or replacement.  I asked about the replacement's delivery. It would be another couple of months. Ridiculous, and shame on Apple for its inferior quality control, but it's par for the course as previous engravings have also been neglected rendering the whole promo a joke - on me unfortunately. So, do I recommend the AirPods Max?  If comfort is your primary consideration, then yes.  If sound quality is your primary consideration, then no. If you need headphones quickly, then it is even more of a headache, and don't even bother with the free engraving.", "Update After Three Weeks", "The headphones have performed well and reproduce virtually all of my music with great fidelity.  The battery still doesn't last as long as claimed by Apple, but the condensation issues that others have reported have not been experienced even after several hours of wear.  They do, unfortunately, make your ears very warm.  The major problem, and successfully resolved by a very capable Apple Support Member, was a failure to re-connect after charging. The reason(s) is still unclear, but after charging the headphones were totally \"dead.\" The factory re-set was attempted three times unsuccessfully.  After re-starting all (Mac) devices with current OS systems, verifying Bluetooth connections, etc. the AirPods Max seemed doomed to a factory repair while still under warranty.  I then re-connected them to the Apple charger and the green indicator light appeared - a good sign! I then paired the headphones again with all devices and they regained functionality at 100% charged.  The Apple Support Member and I were both surprised and relived.  At least, I established a logged case and reported malfunction should it happen again.  Bottom line - for the exorbitant cost one would expect better quality control.

They are wired and open cased so you can\u2019t use them in a plane and you\u2019ll disturb other ppl.  They don\u2019t leak sound but actually acting like speakers!  If that\u2019s not bad enough, you\u2019ll need to plug them into a DAC with a power source.  Did you actually think your tiny MP3 player or phone will power such headphones?  Also gonna be hard for iPhone and Apple users with no jack output.  Lastly, mp3 format is extremely lossy format and not as good as CD or wav files but wav files are huge!  Can you even buy music in wav format?  My point is just get these, it\u2019s beautiful, practical, no wires, and perfect for regular listeners of mp3.  Ariana Grande sounds a beautiful song bird with these headphones.\n"]},

{"profile-name": "Robert", "review-star-rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I bought these mainly because my previous pair (Beoplay H9) was difficult to connect (it sometimes required several attempts) and could not connect to more than one device at the same time. I expected the famous Apple system integration and hoped for better noise cancellation and sound quality. It is only with noise cancellation that I am truly satisfied. The Beoplays were not exceptional in that department but while I have no direct comparison to the Bose or Sony competitors, I can easily believe AirPods Max are up there with the very best. Also, the transparency mode really is excellent. I understand that someone switching from the Sonys or Boses can appreciate the higher quality of the materials, etc., but the Beoplays were certainly not cheaply made, the ear cushions were leather and the whole headphone (despite using metal!) much lighter.  I expected more from the sound. Again, maybe this is because people underestimate the Beoplays (and compared to Sony MX4 or Bose 700 there may be a significant difference), but when compared to my almost 4-year old H9s I could not see any drastic improvement. The sound is a bit more spacious (the soundstage wider), but that's about it. I definitely did not have the experience of hearing my favourite tracks anew (something I felt when switching from Bose Q35 to the Beoplays). What is most surprising is how poor the vaunted Apple integration is. Yes, they are easy to pair for the first time, but let\u2019s be honest. You only do it once. Then it gets worse.  The Airpods may be laying on my desk (ostensibly not in use). Someone calls me on my iPhone. Even though they are not on my head, the call gets redirected to the Airpods. I have to manually override this and return it to the iPhone. The same happens when I am the one making the call. The automatic pairing could be disabled, but then what would be the difference to a third-party product? When I am using my MacBook Pro and putting the headphones on, they rarely connect automatically. I have to click to connect. Not only, then, is the \u201cintegration\u201d and automatic switching moderately useful. At times it is simply infuriating (a few minutes before writing this  was trying to answer a call in the kitchen, the phones were on my desk in another room and the call went to the Airpods!).

These are easily some of the best sounding and feeling headphones I've ever worn. While they are comfortable, they are made out of metal so they are heavier than most headphones so if you wear them for too long you can really start to feel the wight, additionally since the ear cups are attached magnetically you can remove and replace them quite easily. They sound really nice and are awesome for spacial audio and both noise cancellation and transparency mode are incredible. They have nice controls (I just LOVE spinning the digital crown) which consist of a digital crown for volume that you press and hold for siri and a separate button similar to the volume buttons on your phone which is used to switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode as well as skipping and reversing songs. My only real bone to pick with these is the stupid carrying case. It is ugly and annoying, as it is the only way to get the headphones to turn off without manually turning them off in settings. in addition it does not protect the headphones at all and the magnet that holds it shut is kind of loose, furthermore, when you take the headphones out, the ear cups clack together which can cause light damage to them down the road. However, an easy fix is to just buy a different third party case that can turn them off and is just better in basically every way.

{"profile-name": "Matt Eye", "review-star-rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  This iMac is a cheaper alternative to the more meaningful likes of the original iMac and iMac Pro, but there are drawbacks. Most of the ports are available on the back, and the speakers are about as good as iPhone 12 Pro Max, which are quite good for an iMac this compact. However, the M1 chip is focused on VR and AR, not performance. Intel is an industry standard, M1 is new and still relatively unknown to the industry. Mac OS is too hoggy on resources, and doing any kind of simple task is as good as you can do. Photoshop, video editing, gaming, etc. You need 32 GB or more of memory (RAM) to do such work reliably, as just running the system alone uses half the memory. You can hardly run Mac OS at all on 8 GB. The system is showing a few hundred MB available just after booting the system. Yes, the display looks great, but the webcam is average, about the quality from the fourth generation iPod Touch or second generation iPad from late 2010. Just go back to the Intel processor and offer up to 128 GB of memory so that this can do something productive. This new M1 iMac just looks like eye candy only slightly better than a Chromebook. I don't recommend this product unless you do the most basic of tasks or do light productivity on 16 GB of memory, which is no longer enough for any Apple computer running Mac OS in 2021. Too bad, you cannot use Boot Camp on M1, but if you could, and installed Windows 10 through Rosetta 2, you would only be using about half a GB of memory, because the Windows file system requires very little memory, but instead utilizes enormous virtual memory (paging file space). Mac OS is not much of a paging file or virtual memory accolade. Two different animals there. Just beware, these new Apple products with M1 are not as good as many say they are. Even the availability of the new iPad Pro models are very few in production because of this 'radical' change that may require a complete rewrite of Mac OS, or forego unified memory, which is a different way of wording integrated components. Like the different ways of wording corn syrup in food products to 'con' the buyer into something 'healthier.' Three stars in that you will probably have difficulty doing much with this new chip and unified memory setup (you want to get at least 512 GB of storage, or maybe 256 GB is sufficient if you do not have many photos and videos to download).\n"]},

Because I am a big Apple user and have been happy with the AirPods Pro, I figured I wanted to give these a shot.", "Pros", "- Build quality - nothing beats it. The metal makes a big difference. Am curious how well the mesh will hold up. And the earpads are easily replaceable, so I expect long life.", "- Looks - try as I might, I always felt the Sony phones looked too big and bulky, and often they would not sit evenly without some effort. And they are just plain black plastic. I'm not trying to win a beauty pageant, but I prefer how these look for Zoom calls. :)", "- Knob - OMG, I LOVE the knob/button (similar to the crown on the watch). It is soo much nicer having a physical control to turn the volume up and down, as well as easily pause and play. One thing I kinda hated about the Sony (I had an older model as well as the more recent) is how stupid easy it was to accidentally trigger their touch controls. Also, sometimes swipe up/down was interpreted as forward/back. Just not good. But the knob is way better and far harder to accidentally use.", "- Sound Quality - I'm not a crazy audiophile, but I am one. These are just better sounding out of the box for sure. Very clear on mids and highs. Not muddy on lows but enough punch unless you are a bass head, maybe. I like bass, but not too much on headsets as it quickly becomes tiresome. These do a find job of finding the right balance for most types of music w/o touching the EQ. And in fact, I find most of the EQ changes sounded worse than better.", "- Ease of Switching - I admit the latest Sony's made it relatively easy with their app. But pairing and switching between (Apple) devices is almost seamless and pretty near impossible to beat given their special support for their own headsets. Every so often, I have to manually tell it to use these, but most of the time it switches smartly. Sometimes, though, I don't want it to switch over when it does, but no big deal.", "- Sharing Audio - not technically specific to these, but it's pretty slick to share audio on the Apple TV, so my wife and I can watch and listen w/o disturbing the sleeping little one across the hall.", "- Pause/Resume - specifically when taking them off and putting them on. Very responsive and works almost perfectly.", "- Spatial Audio - I first noticed this on my AirPods Pro. I kind of couldn't believe my ears. It's a neat effect. I hope they add it for Apple TV.", "Meh/OK", "- Noise Canceling - It handles a lot of the more obvious white/pink type noise, but it could do better with things like kids yelling in the background. I want to say the Sonys are a bit better on this.", "- Standby Battery Use - I do not understand why yet, but when I just hang them on my headphone holder on my desk, they drain relatively quickly while not in use. Supposedly Apple claims they should go into low power mode without putting them in their case, but I'm not convinced. I think they should essentially lose no power when not in use, but they do.  Playback is fine/good as other options, so far as I can tell, though.", "Cons", "- Price - obviously. I've bought various sets for around $3-400 in the past. So these are by a good bit the most expensive set I've owned. But for all the Pros above, I think it is justified--especially if you are heavily in the Apple device ecosystem.", "- Case - everybody hates it. I don't personally care cuz I only use these at home, but if I had to use that thing a lot, I think I'd not be happy with it.", "In Brief", "I think these are a great headset, especially for Apple folks. I sold my Sonys in favor of these. If you care about the Pros listed above, and you can afford (or want to afford) it, definitely go with these, as of now.\n"]},

The transparency mode is class leading though, have to give them that. They're pretty comfortable, though when the ear pads rub together, the sound and feeling make me want to die.

No joke, these AirPods Max were a bit much on the wallet, but it's been a long time since I've experienced so much satisfaction from an extravagant purchase. I've owned decent quality bluetooth ear buds & headphones, and I've listened to ultra high end headphones with a dedicated amp that were WAY outside my budget reality. At a certain price point, the performance curve of audio equipment tapers off and it becomes an escalating expression of gaudy esthetics. Like most Apple products, the AP Max's have an attention to detail that transcends the market. Their simple ergonomic design, surface textures and materials feel like $550 worth in a way I didn't expect. These aren't the disposable electronic design I'm used to, but harken back to the expectation of quality and design of the past. The weight of these phones is significant but well distributed over the mesh rest and ear pads. I'm not going to say it isn't noticeable, but it's pleasantly reassuring to be reminded I have something special on your ears. Truthfully though, the tactile part is a distant second to the sound quality of these headphones.", "Driving your new Ferrari for the first time, you won't likely find satisfaction on a dirt road. That said, to get a sense of what the Aripod Max are really capable of, steer clear of the streaming Mp3 dirt road and open them up the best mastered music you can find. I used the 24bit mastered album Point by Yello for this, and the 2021 collection of bineural 8D Audio recordings by 8D Tunes. I thought I'd heard these recordings, but my AP Max's reproduced a whole new range of dimension and detail.", "I've played with different settings listening to the same song and turning the noise canceling mode off does produce a slightly higher level of depth and detail. The design quality, sound reproduction, and  noise canceling of the Max's is better than the Bose I got my Dad for his B-day. I understand total sound isolation would be dangerous, but Apple still has room for improvement there IMHO. The transparent mode on the other hand is nothing shore of holy crap remarkable. Very natural sound like taking the headphones off with a button. I don't know if it denigrates any sound quality, but I admit I like to turn on the extended bass in the sound settings of my MacBook and iPhone.", "Thanks Allie, I'm more than satisfied.\n"]},

I can wear them all day and take video and phone calls however, it does give me a slight disorientation effect and minor vertigo, similar to diving or moving to an elevated height (driving up a mountain for example).", "The Air Pods Max are comfortable, and the ear cups surround my large ears just like the QC35 however, there the clamp is noticeable \u2013 this may go away after some time; the clamp causes minor discomfort with glasses; I removed my glasses for the purpose of this short review and the discomfort has faded, even after 60 minutes of listening \u2013 it does clamp more than the QC35 and XM4s.", "Something to keep in mind is the XM4 earpads are not thick enough and my ear brushes against the speaker area; this also makes my ears get hot after 30 minutes and I eventually have to take a short break \u2013 this does not happen with the Air Pods Max \u2013 there is lots of room for my ears and the cushions are thick enough that my ears do not touch the speaker area.", "Microphone:", "  Air Pods Max", "  Bose QC35", "  Sony XM4", "I completed several zoom video/audio calls, Facetime and regular calls.

I tested this for several hours and it has never failed.", "As for the Bose QC35 and XM4\u2019s, no matter if they both have multi device pairing, I am always having issues. Both headsets never switch to my other device without me having to manually disconnect 1 of 2 devices (the one I\u2019m not using). This is frustrating and I hate doing this multiple times per day.", "Music Quality:", "  Air Pods Max", "  Sony XM4", "  Bose QC35", "The Air Pods Max I would rate have 30% better music quality than the XM4. I tested Hip-Hop, Bossa Nova, Jazz, Classical, Deep House, D&B, Techno, Trip Hop, Dubstep and Lounge. The must is more engaging, and I can hear the instruments and vocals in more detail \u2013 an elevated musical experience.

It felt like I had speakers surround me in a 360 fashion at the move theatres. I stood there for 5 minutes with my eyes wide opened in disbelief that headphones were capable of offering this level of experience. It is something that you have to try it to believe it. This is what sold me the most.", "---", "Are the Air Pods Max worth the price? Based on my experience so far, I would say yes.

It\u2019s like new, no scratches or anything. I\u2019ve lost s bit of warranty, but there was a 25% discount on retail price, so I can\u2019t complain.\n"]},

I would at least love this feature to come back and/or will to pay extra for this feature.  This is probably fine for most users but for anyone working with arts, graphics and using different programs etc. this is a real inconvenience. Mac has continued to make its products less compatible with other computer brands.. Overall this will be my last MacBook, the drop and drag, and numerous features that made this a great computer and easy to use, were awesome but are no longer worth it. Oh yeah, also I lost numerous movies that I had purchased off of my iTunes, I contacted the iTunes customer service and no help.  Pretty much I am sad, and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules, like not only needing memory space on the computer (which mine is not full) but my icloud is full, after only 5 or 7 months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop.  So I watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless, and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them. So now I changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and I can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop.

{"profile-name": "Chris", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  First off, let me say, I'm speaking as a tech enthusiast with a decent understanding of gizmos and gadgets. I've owned Windows PCs, a MacBook Pro 2014, and a few Chromebooks. This is, by FAR, my favorite computer that I've ever used. Period. Let me start with my favorite aspects/features, in lovely bullet points for your viewing pleasure:", "-Battery life. Oh my god. I have to TRY to kill this thing in one day. Full brightness, playing The Sims 3 or World of Warcraft, Spotify playing, Safari AND Chrome open in the background... I went from about 100% to 85% in an hour. And that's the most I could do. Usually, I start the day at full battery, then use it on and off all day, and the lowest I've gotten so far is ~40% by bedtime. It. Is. Insane. Not to mention the standby, which is basically 1-2% drop in a day. I cannot stress how amazed I am by the efficiency of this machine.", "-Speakers. Okay, I know some people don't mind a tinny little laptop speaker because they use headphones. But I am not that person, I like to be able to just play music or videos out loud and enjoy them. Well, these speakers are also the BEST I've ever heard on a laptop. It's got such a full, defined, crisp sound, I can hear a lot more of the dynamic range and background effects than any other laptop I've used. It also gets LOUD, I can use it to fill my room with sound, and in fact I've had to turn it down a bit at night because my roomies down the hall can hear it. The bass is the only point that isn't a home run, but for what it's worth, I can definitely hear the bass. It just doesn't boom. Overall, amaaaazing!", "-Keyboard. Short and sweet, this is my favorite keyboard. The previous spot was my 2014 MacBook Pro, but this surpasses that. The keys travel well, I make less mistakes, and it's quiet and comfortable. Not much else to say, it's just really good.", "-Screen. Still a gorgeous Retina display, crisp, bright AF, colorful, and easy on the eyes thanks to True Tone. I'm not an artist or video editor, so this is just coming from an average consumer.", "-Touch Bar. I know this is a divisive opinion, but I personally really like the Touch Bar! Some apps take advantage of it, and it really helps. Spotify keeps the controls on the bar, so I can switch and adjust music without having to switch back to the app. The sliders for brightness and volume are easy to press and slide, and frankly I just enjoy it. Touch ID on the corner is also LOVELY for logging in, making purchases, or filling forms out on webpages. One touch and you're good. Brilliant.", "-Form factor. I love this skinny slab of aluminum. I'm a minimalist, and it just pleases me to hold and look at. This is completely subjective, but I'm a fan.", "-Speed. Oh my god. This thing is legitimately the fastest computer that I've ever used. I'm honestly shook at how easily it handles anything I throw at it. It runs World of Warcraft on High settings at 60fps. No other MacBook could do that, the 8 core graphics chip really lives up to its specs. I can have tons of tabs open, a game, things updating in the background, and this guy doesn't break a sweat. All while absolutely SIPPING battery.", "-Fans. Yes, the main difference between this and the M1 Air is that the Pro has an active cooling system. That being said, I've heard the fan come on about 3 times in 3 weeks. Even when running all that stuff I said before. I'm befuddled by how great the thermal dissipation works in this thing. It's good that it has fans, even if it barely uses them.", "Less good but still aight:", "-USB-C ports. Yes, there's only 2 on the left side. Yes, I had to buy an adapter for HDMI and USB-A. Am I mad about it? Not really, I only need to use those things when I'm docked at a desk anyway. I use a bluetooth mouse or the touchpad, and I have AirPods for headphones. So I don't need to plug many things in anyway. But if you do, definitely invest in an adapter. I use one by Anker, with 3 USB-A, an HDMI, and an ethernet port.", "-To add to the USB-C impressions, I still miss MagSafe, so I actually purchased a \"magnetic\" USB-C cable, which you put the receiver in the MacBook USB port, and the cable magnetically attaches to it, just like the old MagSafe. This makes me feel safer, because a firm USB-C cable sticking out the side makes me nervous, if I were to drop it or hit it on something and mess up the port. Highly recommend a cable like this.", "-Price. It's expensive, there's no way around that. But I'd consider it an investment, because generally speaking, Macs last many many years over their Windows counterparts. And since this is the first to use Apple silicon, I'm sure it will be supported for a long while.", "-Webcam. It's just not great. The AI enhancements are definitely noticeable and make you look better, but at the end of the day, its a 720p webcam in a $1300+ computer. Come on apple, is 1080p that hard to add?", "-App compatibility. While I have had almost no issues, some apps may not play nice with the M1 right now. The only real issues I had were that The Sims 2 Deluxe collection does not work, which I discovered is an issue for everyone with the M1 Macs. But luckily the devs say theyre working on a fix, so hopefully it's just a small number of apps with issues. Other than that, every other app has worked great.", "Verdict: I love this computer. Sometimes I just sit and marvel at it. Sometimes I pick it up just to feel how nice it fits in my hands. It is legitimately my favorite computer, and if you're willing to make the investment, I think it's a fantastic computer for most people. If you don't need the Touch Bar or extra oomph from the fans, the M1 Air might be for you. But for me, man, the M1 MacBook Pro is THE laptop king. Or queen. 5 stars from me!", "Update: I've had the MBP for about 2 months now, and I'm still completely in love with it. I stream on Twitch, and I can run OBS, a game like World of Warcraft, Spotify, Discord, Safari... all without a hiccup. The only real time I get the fans running is when I do this. I have seen the temperature of the cores spike to about 204 degrees Fahrenheit under load, but it's never shut down. It throttled once, as I noticed a slowdown, but I was running literally all those apps plus a discord video call, so I assume either the 8GB of ram couldn't handle it, or the cores got too hot. I was really pushing it though. Battery is still amazing, and I can run WoW Classic on max settings easily. Overall, still impressed, and still my favorite machine EVER!\n"]},

I know people who don't have more than one Apple device hear all the time that having more than one always works great because of the ecosystem but usually only take it at face value. I was one of those people even up until I had my Apple Watch for a while but the MacBook really hooked me in. Once you realize how everything just works you don't know how you were able to do it before. Of course there is the whole walled garden argument everyone that dislikes Apple love to talk about but in reality I don't care if this walled garden is at war the rest of the world it's the best, most simple, and seamless ecosystem for the average consumer. There is a learning curve for those that come from other operating systems like the different feel of the keyboard, shortcuts, trackpad, and overall OS. But I've only been using this device for short while and already caught on super quick. I feel like despite all these positives there is still the high price. I purchased the 512 GB model and it came to around $1400 with a sale so it might take a while for the slight buyer's remorse to go away but I feel like the more I use it the quicker I become satisfied with my purchase. My final thoughts would have to be, if you have the money to purchase this at any configuration then go for it. Simply keep in mind there is a lot that goes into the satisfaction for this product; the ecosystem which would require more apple devices, the willingness to learn a new OS, understanding the added level of security and privacy that comes with Apple devices and the use case for each individual.\n"]},

So, why did I get another one? I'm about to start nursing school at the end of August which requires you to have a laptop all day (about 8 hours). My dad surprised me this MacBook. I am an apple girl through and through (watch, phone, AirPods). To say that I was over the moon receiving my first MacBook was an understatement. I've been testing it out for about a week now. It came in perfect condition. No scratches or problems with the screen. This computer is FAST when it comes to everything. As soon as you open it, it is on. I seriously can't catch it off no matter how little I open it. Every web page pops up quick and loads quicker. I'm amazed that I can text through this MacBook and it synced all of my stuff from the cloud effortlessly. It has a Touch Bar that is insanely cool and in my opinion, useful. The battery life. OMG the battery life. I purposely did everything in my power to drain it. I am on day 7 of using it without charging it and it is at 41%. Now, I haven't been on it all day everyday. I have mainly used it to write, read, and text. However, I've used for a good 4 hours each day. If you're a college student who needs a reliable computer this one is for you!!!!

Unlike some reviews I did not notice any sibilance that affects the SQ and I find the sound profile to be well balanced. In my opinion they sound much better, richer and fuller than the Sony WH-1000XM4. The headphones are easy to listen to for an hour or more and I do not notice any fatigue. They are heavy, but the headband is unlike anything else I have used before and does a very good job to distribute the weight on the top of the head such that I do not feel that comfort is an issue even after more than an hour of wear. I did not experience any condensation buildup as others have reported. Noise cancellation is best in class and the transparency mode is superior to both Bose and Sony. Unlike the Sony WH-1000XM4 and its XM3 predecessor (both of which I\u2019ve owned), the AirPods Max do exhibit some sound leaking. This may or may not be a problem when listening at night depending on volume level and other person\u2019s sensitivity.\n"]},

{"profile-name": "Jeff Gomske", "review-star-rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  Okay, I've been an Android fan since, well, since the very beginning...I still am if I'm being honest. I have also spent a ridiculously large amount of $$ on smart watches over the years starting with the original Moto 360 (anyone remember that flat tire?). It LOOKED cool, especially that round face, but performance-wise, well, it was kinda terrible. The battery life was insultingly horrible (it would lose 7% in the ten minute drive to work while just sitting on my wrist doing nothing). But the potential was there. In finally switched to Samsung's Tizen at the introduction of the Gear S2. What a great watch that was. I went on to the Gear S3, the Gear Sport, the Galaxy Watch, the GW3 and then I heard the news: Samsung was going back to Wear OS. This disappointed me greatly. Over the years I have owned well over a dozen watches utilizing Wear OS (or Android Wear before that) and while I loved a lot about many of them, they ALL suffered from the stuttering and glitching that plagues essentially ALL Wear OS devices. Some have managed to work around that to produce the best version they possibly can (TicWatch Pro 3 and the Oppo Watch are just 2 examples) but each had at least something that just didn't work properly - and I don't blame either manufacturer for this. It's an ongoing problem with Wear OS itself. Slowly, I began to warm to the idea that maybe, just MAYBE Samsung will make it work the way it was always supposed to work. So, I bought the Galaxy Watch 4.", "Did Samsung fix Wear OS? In a word: NO. It still suffers from glitches, hiccups and stuttering and apps not opening properly and/or timely. At times it works just great (which is more often than not, but still...), I have a fairly expensive watch that ruins what otherwise ought to be a smoother experience than what I'm getting. My Galaxy Watch 3 runs fantastic (it runs on TIzen software and not Wear OS) and honestly, I have had zero issues with it since I got it over a year ago, nor any with my previous Tizen watches including the Gear S2, S3, Gear Sport and original Galaxy Watch. I have had intermittent issues with the GW4 since the day I brought it home. To be fair, I have heard many people who claim that their Watch 4's have run flawlessly since they bought theirs...but I cannot speak to their experience, only the one I've had - but I brought it up to be fair.", "I have done a LOT of research regarding all different kinds of smart watches, and you know what you almost never hear from the majority of apple watch owners? You don't hear about not getting a notification, or stuttering and glitches here and there. Sure, I'm sure they exist, but the overwhelming majority generally say the same thing: the watch JUST WORKS. Honestly, that is all I really care about. Does it do what it claims and does it do it consistently? From an Android Fanboy, I can say this without reservation: the apple watch works and does so CONSISTENTLY. I simply cannot say that about my GW4 or any other Wear OS device I have used over the last 6-8 years.", "Okay, now why did I switch? Well, when I heard that the apple watch could be used without an iPhone, it really caught my attention. Seriously, an apple watch that can be set up so the user does not need an iPhone?? Well that's just what I wanted to hear. The truth is, once the watch is set up with \"Family Setup\" as long as it's an LTE model watch, you do not need to have it paired with an iPhone AT ALL...however (and this is a biggie) - you STILL need an iPhone to set it up initially. That sucked. But - I have enough friends with iPhone's that I took the plunge anyway.", "The watch looks phenomenal BTW. I got the blue model and that new watch face that takes advantage of the larger screen is fantastic. Since this is my very first apple watch, I can't speak to how well it compares to earlier models, so I'm sorry about that. Honestly however, having not used a previous model before, I just don't see that there is a difference that is noticeable when compared to my friends who have earlier model apple watches. The major thing I like is exactly what I wanted most: a watch that is reliable. It took a bit of getting used to because I have been so familiar with Wear OS and Tizen watches for so long, but it isn't difficult, just takes a little time, that's all. I haven't always liked the apple rectangular shape...but slowly, it grew on me. It was always made really well, of that there has never been any doubt, but the series 7 is just great to look at.", "The one thing keeping my review from 5 to only 4 stars was the pretty HUGE omission of the charging block. As you've no doubt gathered by now, I'm a android guy and always have been. My last 4 phones have all used USB-C chargers...but none of them came with blocks that the USB-C cord went into, they all had the USB-C port on only ONE end, not both. It's fair to assume the majority of apple users do not own one of these, either. Meaning, it's an unnecessary EXTRA expense you absolutely MUST make in order to even be able to use your watch - unless you have a charger from a previous apple watch which you can still use, but you won't be able to take advantage of the faster charging time. For what apple is charging for this watch, leaving this out is nothing shy of a ginormous cash grab on their part, and it's rather blatant and disappointing. Seriously guys, this is simple greed...and if anyone at their HQ bothers to read any of these reviews will note that there are quite a few upset genuine apple fanatics who really are quite upset by this same situation, so I am definitely NOT alone here. Wise up apple or you'll force longtime fans into the arms of Wear OS simply to make a statement.", "With that said, the watch operates extraordinarily well. I have seen zero hiccups that I see each time I turned on my Galaxy Watch 4 (seriously, EVERY time I turn it on, I get a notification that tells me I have voice mail, but when I check, there is nothing there - literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I turn the watch on. After 3 months...it got old...and now it simply makes me mad). I've always heard of the great haptics on apple devices and now I know what they mean. Samsung does a pretty good job as well on their watches, don't get me wrong, but these are just, well, better. It's hard to describe unless you've actually worn one to feel the difference. My TicWatch Pro 3 is actually a pretty good Wear OS watch, it really is...however, the haptics are so friggin' anemic I miss 90% of my notification vibrations due to the poor haptic engine it has. (this is an issue with hundreds of thousands of other TicWatch Pro 3 owners...it's on many online threads if you're curious) That isn't the case here with the series 7. I get ALL my notifications and in a timely manner and that on-screen keyboard with swipe-like ability is fantastic. It's not as good as the Google keyboard, but it isn't far behind...and for quick text input, especially if you're in a loud environment where you cannot use voice dictation, or you're in a quiet place or you simply don't want people around you to hear what you're replying, this is a wonderful tool and it works pretty great. Kudos to apple for adding it. I want to mention the haptic engine again...it's actually quite impressive. It vibrates in a totally different manner than ALL other smart watches I've ever owned. It works beautifully and it is hard to miss a notification due to it's efficiency. I swear, if my TicWatch had a decent haptic engine and better music-transfer capability, I may never have even considered getting the apple watch at all.", "This the only smartwatch besides Samsung to make transferring music to your watch pretty seamless. OR SO I THOUGHT. I tried almost a dozen different programs supposedly designed to help convert my mp3's to easily transfer to my phone and then onto my watch. Almost every one would cap you at transferring 10 songs per day ONLY - unless you paid money. Even iTunes was a problem saying that I had to change this setting on my phone in order to transfer music...yet no matter how often I changed the setting, it still said I needed to do the same thing again. I deleted iTunes and re-downloaded it and tried again. Nope. Same issue. I finally discovered a program called, \"SynciOS\" which allowed me to transfer music in a pretty intuitive manner and do it ridiculously quick. Not sure why it took so long to be able to do something so simple, but sheesh, this was essentially the only thing that really frustrated me regarding my series 7 watch. Samsung makes this process STUPID EASY to do and sorry apple fans, is FAR SUPERIOR to how apple does it. All other Wear OS watches are no better at making this an easy process and in fact, can make it even more difficult.", "I love how on my hikes, while listening to music on my watch, I'll get updates every mile I've reached. This is another great feature...but its one that is done better with the Galaxy Watches. The Original GW and the GW3 and GW4 all give you this same information but goes a few steps further. Samsung tells you when you've reached that mile, but also tells you how many steps you've taken to get there AND your heart rate. It only takes 3-4 extra seconds and it works great. The difference between Tizen and Wear OS however is that with TIzen the music would halt while the watch reads out that info thru the bluetooth earbuds, while Wear OS it just slightly lowers the volume of music and tells you the information. Apple lowers the music volume much lower which makes hearing your metrics much easier, but still, the more information the better as far as I'm concerned. Yesterday I wore both my GW3 and the apple watch and they each marked every mile within probably 4-5 seconds of one another - or roughly 15-20 feet difference, which says they both were pretty spot-on for how they measured distance. They both were within about 7 steps of each other as well and heart rate were off by 1 or 2 beats per minute. That tells me either they are both accurate, or both are off by roughly the same amount. There may be a few workout routines that apple doesn't cover which Samsung does and vice versa, but they do all the one's I personally use regularly and that's what counts as far as I'm concerned. Great implementation, too.", "All in all, you've made this Android user a convert. Though, I still prefer using my Samsung phone. Sorry guys.", "***UPDATE***", "Battery life compared to my GW4 is simply astonishing - especially considering how much people whine about it online. Case in point: yesterday I braved the snow and 15 degree temps and walked the 5 miles home from work for my exercise. I wore both my Galaxy Watch 4 and apple watch 7. Keep in mind before I left, I topped off my GW4 til it was at 100%, something I could not do with my apple watch since I do not have a spare charger at work like I do with my Samsung watches, which seem to need it more often. I will stipulate that after a few weeks using my GW4 the battery life improved significantly as it \"learned\" my habits and adjusted accordingly. I used GPS on both to keep track of my walk, and listened to music downloaded to both watches and switched from one to the other exactly at the half-way point to make it fair. By the time I reached home, my GW4 was down to 61%. Now keep in mind I had been using my apple watch since 5am that morning and wasn't able to charge it before leaving for home. When I hit home my apple watch 7 was still at 79%. That is astonishing to me...and an enormously HUGE difference. I have suspected the battery life was better, but not by THAT much. I just looked it up, and the 45mm apple Watch 7 has a battery size of 309 mAh, while the GW4 has a battery size of 361 mAh. Sorry, but this is a GINORMOUS apple win here. It seems every other review I read about the newest apple watch, one of the chief complaints is battery life, but when compared to the GW4, I cannot help but be happy with it's performance so far. After having used the apple watch for over a week, using the GW4 reminded me (again) that Wear OS just isn't quite there yet. The crazy glitches that plague this system, the incessant notification of voicemail that is NEVER there 100% of the time whenever I turn the watch off and turn it back on again, the notification that my watch is playing media that isn't there, or that it's paired with a kindle that I have never paired it with, the slowness of opening apps and closing them again, the problem of pulling down the settings menu and how it works about half the time I try to pull it down, or scroll up working only part of the time, or how I close all apps only to discover some still open - apps I've never tried to open since the day I bought my watch...the list goes on and on. You know what glitches I've had with the apple watch? NONE. Seriously. I haven't had one single hiccup since I turned this device on. I truly wished this were not the case with my Samsung. The honest truth is I wouldn't even have an apple watch were it not for my sour experience with the newest Galaxy Watch. I still hope that a future update will correct most of these problems, and if so, I will be thrilled to see them implemented and will gladly state so. Problem is, I don't think this is Samsung's problem, it's an issue with Wear OS and Samsung can only do so much to correct it. I DO find it interesting that my older TicWatch Pro 3 has shown far fewer issues and glitches than the GW4 in pretty much every situation...so maybe its a combination of Wear OS and Samsung's version of Wear OS 3.0. Either way, I've been very disappointed in my experience and wish that they had never switched from Tizen in the first place. Oh well. Time will tell if Wear OS can correct these issues or not.", "The body composition feature is cool on the GW4. I really thought it would be more useful, though. I suppose it can be, but - for me at least - it simply hasn't been something that I've been able to get any kind of genuine use out of. Reportedly it can actually measure your blood pressure...but on a watch? I honestly cannot see how accurate that could be using any kind of method the way the watch is set up. Every reputable medical site I have looked at says the tech is far too new and simply isn't capable - yet anyway - of accurately being able to measure blood pressure monitoring. Kudos to Samsung for initiating it, but at this point, I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock on accuracy.", "Charging...so, since this is my first apple watch, I can't compare it's supposedly 33% faster charging over previous models...but I WILL say it's faster than the Galaxy Watch 4, 3, Original Galaxy Watch etc. and my TicWatch Pro 3...however, I have an Oppo Watch (which was clearly a ripoff of the apple watch design, but in their defense, they did a STELLAR job with it), now that watch charges FAST. Exactly how much faster, I cannot say for certain, but let's just say all of those other models I mentioned pale in comparison. I just find it absurd that apple did not include a charging block. An utterly imbecilic decision.\n"]},

At minimum, I wanted the watch to count steps, maybe measure distance as well, and measure and keep track of my heart rate.

What am I doing installing a pedometer app?  This seemed like buying an iPhone and having to install a phone app.  If you know the watch OS, I hope it wouldn't take you that long to set this up just the way you want it, but I didn't have the patience.  I think I got the number of steps to display but then there wasn't a place to put the heart rate.  I expected less hassle for this simple function.", "I opened the iPhone Watch app.  I'm sure there is a way to get it out of the Settings screen, but at this point, as I was about to refresh my perception of how this app wasn't that easy to use, I can't get it to do anything except alter various settings.  I can't back out of the Settings into the program itself.  I've only been using computers since 1982 or so, when I studied assembly language on a machine with 1K Ram and cassette tape instead of a hard drive, so it could be that I'm not capable of figuring out how to operate the easy to use Apple software interface.", "I even have an Apple Watch for Dummies book, the latest edition.  I ended up looking online for solutions to problems as they came up because for me the book was full of a lot of tips and info except no info on the particular problem, whatever it was, that I had.", "Apple doesn't even consider the type of exercise that I am doing at the moment, i.e. fairly gentle walking coming back from a serious heart issue, as exercise.  So they program their software out of the box to ignore the type of walking I do, so people say.  Maybe the watch can be tweaked or if I muttered the right incantation it might decide my walks are exercise,  but as I looked for info on how to make the watch display information about my proposed walks, the first warnings I ran into were that walks are not exercise in the Apple ecosystem unless they are of a certain intensity.  I don't know because I couldn't set up the watch well enough to even take it for a walk before I gave up and told my wife, who gave it to me as a present, that I was going to send it back.", "The screen is beautiful.  The 45mm watch seems too big and bulky for me and I am 6 foot 1 inch with big hands.  The aesthetically appealing watch faces are the least customizable.  I made sure to turn the alarm off but it went off at 6:30 am anyway, and it would not manually stop sounding off every few minutes after that.  Etc.  I'm sure I could have found some setting other than alarm OFF that would have made the alarm not be set to go off tomorrow morning, but...\n"]},
{"profile-name": "adandelion4you", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  As already posted in previous reviews, this watch doesn\u2019t come with the usb c brick that you need to charge it, so buy yourself one when you order your new watch. I already had one because I recently bought an iPhone 13 pro. That and the shorter battery life of this watch are the only drawbacks. You\u2019re going to have to charge this watch every 24 hours. That being said, it\u2019s a wonderful watch. It came in sealed, Apple packaging. The watch box was sealed on both ends. I mention this because of a few other reviews that complain of unsealed packaging and missing items. It has many features and I love that the health app integrates with the watch and you can view all of the data collected by the watch there. I ordered and received the 41mm. I\u2019m a woman and I find that an adequate size for my wrist and I\u2019m actually glad that I didn\u2019t get the 45mm because it would have been too big and I\u2019m not a dainty female with a small wrist. It has a lot of apps available and I took about a third of them off and that made the ones I wanted easier to view. It has a lot of watch faces to choose from and there are watch face apps available as well. I would have preferred a different color but with all of the watch bands available to choose from and different colors of hard screen protectors out there, it really didn\u2019t matter and it\u2019s a great price. I did purchase the offered insurance for $79 as well. All in all, it\u2019s a great watch. The last comment I\u2019d make is that something as basic as a wall charger that\u2019s required to charge the product that you\u2019ve just spent several hundred $$ on, should include it. Are you listening Apple? Probably not, oh well.\n"]},

To me it\u2019s not much of an upgrade but you\u2019re coming from a Series 3 and below then the upgrades will be major. People that complain about not having a charging brick in the box need to read the description as the description clearly says it doesn\u2019t come with one so why complain about something that you should\u2019ve known from the get go? They should do better research on what they buy next time and plus if you bought a new smart phone or even tablet within the last few years you should have a spare USB C charging brick laying around if not just suck it up and buy one Apple doesn\u2019t include one so it can save on waste and declutters their packaging.

Lot\u2019s of complaining here for something that\u2019s a pretty amazing and bonus with an emergency alert for her to get help. I\u2019m not sure how much people feel is okay to pay for all of this but for me it\u2019s one of my favorite things and seeing my moms face light up and marvel over this thing makes me say it\u2019s money well spent. Apple is a business, so is Verizon, Cable companies , service providers any many other monthly expenses that overcharge and don\u2019t include all the accessories you need either. Apps are also money makers but some of them make our lives convenient. Go on you tube and look up how to set up your phones/watches. It shouldn\u2019t take anyone 6 hours. From the time my mom opened it, while on a FaceTime call with my brother in Germany within literally 5 minutes it was syncing to her phone. Nothing difficult about it.\n"]},
{"profile-name": "W. Herman", "review-star-rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  The iOS is horrible, frustrating, and counter intuitive. Want a stopwatch? Not on this device! Oh it has a stopwatch that is useless garbage. After one minute, the only thing it displays is 1:\u2014:\u2014. What genius thought of this? It\u2019s not saving battery, the display is still on! You can raise your wrist and the numbers appear, but if I have a heavy dumbbell in my hand or I\u2019m stabilizing it in my lap, I can\u2019t move my wrist. Just have the flipping numbers on screen!! FFS. Do you want to know what minute you\u2019re on after 70 seconds? Tough sh**, the screen switches to the time. So now you\u2019re forced to bring up your wrist. And yes, I\u2019ve looked up and changed every setting possible. Nothing I do prevents this. Well, why don\u2019t you download a third part app? Hey, let\u2019s try that. That was a massive headache itself and after I finally did download a third party stopwatch app that showed all of the numbers, the amazing, intuitive Apple iOS darkens and reverts to the time. Un-flipping-believable. Want to turn that setting off? Tough sh**, Mr. Customer, you can only look at the app for 70 seconds, so screw your three minute timer, peasant. \u201cWhat you need to do is toggle the hide sensitive complications options on or off.\u201d Guess what, that doesn\u2019t work. Not after 70 seconds. While I\u2019m talking about the display, sometimes an app view screen shows up randomly and I literally can\u2019t do anything to get out of it. The only option I have is to turn it off and back on again. That\u2019s extremely frustrating. Also, they need to figure out which direction the scroll when is used for. One screen the scroll wheel moves the screen in the direction you push the wheel (up is up and down is down), but when you go to move the cursor to edit text, down on the wheel moves the cursor up. Why? Why would they do this? Well we\u2019re on the subject of text, the talk to text on this watch is atrocious. I can say the exact same thing on my iPhone and it works great. The watch simply does a turd job at understanding talk to text. When I do scroll down to go up and select a word to change it to something that I actually said instead of what it wrote, the options simply aren\u2019t there. Ever. Also, when I\u2019m on the workout app tracking my heart rate and I switch to a Stopwatch app to track my time in between sets, I looked down at my watch to check the time and it switched back to the workout app! That\u2019s so extremely frustrating. When I switch to another app I want to look at that flipping app. I don\u2019t want you to change to the time, I don\u2019t want you to change apps regardless of what you think I want to see. It\u2019s little stuff like this that makes me want to ask, will it blend? Sometimes I think putting it down the garbage disposal or in a Vitamix would make me much happier due to the frustration I have with the iOS. What stops me from doing that? The hardware. The hardware is really amazing. I love the way it feels in my wrist, I love the heart rate monitor which never drops my heart rate (unlike every Fitbit or Mio watch I\u2019ve had). The screen is fantastic, the haptics are really nice and not overbearing. For the amount that this thing cost the fact that the software is so crippling there\u2019s no way I can recommend someone purchase this until they get the iOS fixed.\n"]},

I think that is kind of ridiculous that I spent this kind of money on a watch that was damaged before I got it, and now I have to send it to someone else for repair. The Apple support sight is no help what so ever unless you have a software problem. I can't even just send the watch back to Amazon for a refund without going through Amazon support. At this point I just want to send it back for a refund, but Amazon and Apple are making that difficult!\n"]},

It blows away tablets from all other manufacturers, and will do most of what the more expensive iPads will do, albeit not as quickly and not as attractively. It's a great, excellent bang-for-the buck tablet for media consumption and light creative work (email, short documents). If you add a bluetooth keyboard, which I do, you can quickly bang out long emails and longer documents. It's a very versatile and portable device with an all-day battery.", "That said, I'm upgrading to the 2021 model, which is a substantial upgrade over 2020 version at same price. Contrary to the statement by another reviewer, the improvement to the front-facing camera is a big deal. The resolution is markedly better, which is good for FaceTime calls, the Center Stage feature, which isn't available even on the iPad Air, is an upgrade for video, and the TrueTone display is more satisfying to many (I like it).", "Moreover, the base memory for the 2021 model is, at 64 gb, twice that of the 2020 model which was pretty tight although usable at 32 gb. I bumped up against that limit a couple of times, so I love getting double the memory.", "The 2021 model has a moderately faster CPU chip and substantially faster GPU (graphic) function, neither of which matter at this point for my use.", "I probably would have hung onto the 2020 model which is adequate to most of my tasks, despite the relatively low memory. But Apple and a blue Big Box store offer pretty good trade-ins on the 2020. By taking advantage of price matching and trade-in of the 2020, I'm able to get the 202110.2 for $80. It's well worth $80 to me for the additional storage and the greatly improved front facing camera. You might be able to sell a 2020 for more than I got on the trade-in, but I didn't explore that.", "In brief, the 2021 10.2 inch iPad should be on your short list for tablets--check out the reviews.

The transfer is using cellar instead of wifi. It took forever to finish it because the celluar signal at my home is not strong and mobile data speed is like 2-3mb at best, like wifi b protocol. I do not know why Apple decided to use celluar instead of wifi to do the transfer and there is no option to choose between the two.

{"profile-name": "Jeff Gomske", "review-star-rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  Okay, I've been an Android fan since, well, since the very beginning...I still am if I'm being honest. I have also spent a ridiculously large amount of $$ on smart watches over the years starting with the original Moto 360 (anyone remember that flat tire?). It LOOKED cool, especially that round face, but performance-wise, well, it was kinda terrible. The battery life was insultingly horrible (it would lose 7% in the ten minute drive to work while just sitting on my wrist doing nothing). But the potential was there. In finally switched to Samsung's Tizen at the introduction of the Gear S2. What a great watch that was. I went on to the Gear S3, the Gear Sport, the Galaxy Watch, the GW3 and then I heard the news: Samsung was going back to Wear OS. This disappointed me greatly. Over the years I have owned well over a dozen watches utilizing Wear OS (or Android Wear before that) and while I loved a lot about many of them, they ALL suffered from the stuttering and glitching that plagues essentially ALL Wear OS devices. Some have managed to work around that to produce the best version they possibly can (TicWatch Pro 3 and the Oppo Watch are just 2 examples) but each had at least something that just didn't work properly - and I don't blame either manufacturer for this. It's an ongoing problem with Wear OS itself. Slowly, I began to warm to the idea that maybe, just MAYBE Samsung will make it work the way it was always supposed to work. So, I bought the Galaxy Watch 4.", "Did Samsung fix Wear OS? In a word: NO. It still suffers from glitches, hiccups and stuttering and apps not opening properly and/or timely. At times it works just great (which is more often than not, but still...), I have a fairly expensive watch that ruins what otherwise ought to be a smoother experience than what I'm getting. My Galaxy Watch 3 runs fantastic (it runs on TIzen software and not Wear OS) and honestly, I have had zero issues with it since I got it over a year ago, nor any with my previous Tizen watches including the Gear S2, S3, Gear Sport and original Galaxy Watch. I have had intermittent issues with the GW4 since the day I brought it home. To be fair, I have heard many people who claim that their Watch 4's have run flawlessly since they bought theirs...but I cannot speak to their experience, only the one I've had - but I brought it up to be fair.", "I have done a LOT of research regarding all different kinds of smart watches, and you know what you almost never hear from the majority of apple watch owners? You don't hear about not getting a notification, or stuttering and glitches here and there. Sure, I'm sure they exist, but the overwhelming majority generally say the same thing: the watch JUST WORKS. Honestly, that is all I really care about. Does it do what it claims and does it do it consistently? From an Android Fanboy, I can say this without reservation: the apple watch works and does so CONSISTENTLY. I simply cannot say that about my GW4 or any other Wear OS device I have used over the last 6-8 years.", "Okay, now why did I switch? Well, when I heard that the apple watch could be used without an iPhone, it really caught my attention. Seriously, an apple watch that can be set up so the user does not need an iPhone?? Well that's just what I wanted to hear. The truth is, once the watch is set up with \"Family Setup\" as long as it's an LTE model watch, you do not need to have it paired with an iPhone AT ALL...however (and this is a biggie) - you STILL need an iPhone to set it up initially. That sucked. But - I have enough friends with iPhone's that I took the plunge anyway.", "The watch looks phenomenal BTW. I got the blue model and that new watch face that takes advantage of the larger screen is fantastic. Since this is my very first apple watch, I can't speak to how well it compares to earlier models, so I'm sorry about that. Honestly however, having not used a previous model before, I just don't see that there is a difference that is noticeable when compared to my friends who have earlier model apple watches. The major thing I like is exactly what I wanted most: a watch that is reliable. It took a bit of getting used to because I have been so familiar with Wear OS and Tizen watches for so long, but it isn't difficult, just takes a little time, that's all. I haven't always liked the apple rectangular shape...but slowly, it grew on me. It was always made really well, of that there has never been any doubt, but the series 7 is just great to look at.", "The one thing keeping my review from 5 to only 4 stars was the pretty HUGE omission of the charging block. As you've no doubt gathered by now, I'm a android guy and always have been. My last 4 phones have all used USB-C chargers...but none of them came with blocks that the USB-C cord went into, they all had the USB-C port on only ONE end, not both. It's fair to assume the majority of apple users do not own one of these, either. Meaning, it's an unnecessary EXTRA expense you absolutely MUST make in order to even be able to use your watch - unless you have a charger from a previous apple watch which you can still use, but you won't be able to take advantage of the faster charging time. For what apple is charging for this watch, leaving this out is nothing shy of a ginormous cash grab on their part, and it's rather blatant and disappointing. Seriously guys, this is simple greed...and if anyone at their HQ bothers to read any of these reviews will note that there are quite a few upset genuine apple fanatics who really are quite upset by this same situation, so I am definitely NOT alone here. Wise up apple or you'll force longtime fans into the arms of Wear OS simply to make a statement.", "With that said, the watch operates extraordinarily well. I have seen zero hiccups that I see each time I turned on my Galaxy Watch 4 (seriously, EVERY time I turn it on, I get a notification that tells me I have voice mail, but when I check, there is nothing there - literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I turn the watch on. After 3 months...it got old...and now it simply makes me mad). I've always heard of the great haptics on apple devices and now I know what they mean. Samsung does a pretty good job as well on their watches, don't get me wrong, but these are just, well, better. It's hard to describe unless you've actually worn one to feel the difference. My TicWatch Pro 3 is actually a pretty good Wear OS watch, it really is...however, the haptics are so friggin' anemic I miss 90% of my notification vibrations due to the poor haptic engine it has. (this is an issue with hundreds of thousands of other TicWatch Pro 3 owners...it's on many online threads if you're curious) That isn't the case here with the series 7. I get ALL my notifications and in a timely manner and that on-screen keyboard with swipe-like ability is fantastic. It's not as good as the Google keyboard, but it isn't far behind...and for quick text input, especially if you're in a loud environment where you cannot use voice dictation, or you're in a quiet place or you simply don't want people around you to hear what you're replying, this is a wonderful tool and it works pretty great. Kudos to apple for adding it. I want to mention the haptic engine again...it's actually quite impressive. It vibrates in a totally different manner than ALL other smart watches I've ever owned. It works beautifully and it is hard to miss a notification due to it's efficiency. I swear, if my TicWatch had a decent haptic engine and better music-transfer capability, I may never have even considered getting the apple watch at all.", "This the only smartwatch besides Samsung to make transferring music to your watch pretty seamless. OR SO I THOUGHT. I tried almost a dozen different programs supposedly designed to help convert my mp3's to easily transfer to my phone and then onto my watch. Almost every one would cap you at transferring 10 songs per day ONLY - unless you paid money. Even iTunes was a problem saying that I had to change this setting on my phone in order to transfer music...yet no matter how often I changed the setting, it still said I needed to do the same thing again. I deleted iTunes and re-downloaded it and tried again. Nope. Same issue. I finally discovered a program called, \"SynciOS\" which allowed me to transfer music in a pretty intuitive manner and do it ridiculously quick. Not sure why it took so long to be able to do something so simple, but sheesh, this was essentially the only thing that really frustrated me regarding my series 7 watch. Samsung makes this process STUPID EASY to do and sorry apple fans, is FAR SUPERIOR to how apple does it. All other Wear OS watches are no better at making this an easy process and in fact, can make it even more difficult.", "I love how on my hikes, while listening to music on my watch, I'll get updates every mile I've reached. This is another great feature...but its one that is done better with the Galaxy Watches. The Original GW and the GW3 and GW4 all give you this same information but goes a few steps further. Samsung tells you when you've reached that mile, but also tells you how many steps you've taken to get there AND your heart rate. It only takes 3-4 extra seconds and it works great. The difference between Tizen and Wear OS however is that with TIzen the music would halt while the watch reads out that info thru the bluetooth earbuds, while Wear OS it just slightly lowers the volume of music and tells you the information. Apple lowers the music volume much lower which makes hearing your metrics much easier, but still, the more information the better as far as I'm concerned. Yesterday I wore both my GW3 and the apple watch and they each marked every mile within probably 4-5 seconds of one another - or roughly 15-20 feet difference, which says they both were pretty spot-on for how they measured distance. They both were within about 7 steps of each other as well and heart rate were off by 1 or 2 beats per minute. That tells me either they are both accurate, or both are off by roughly the same amount. There may be a few workout routines that apple doesn't cover which Samsung does and vice versa, but they do all the one's I personally use regularly and that's what counts as far as I'm concerned. Great implementation, too.", "All in all, you've made this Android user a convert. Though, I still prefer using my Samsung phone. Sorry guys.", "***UPDATE***", "Battery life compared to my GW4 is simply astonishing - especially considering how much people whine about it online. Case in point: yesterday I braved the snow and 15 degree temps and walked the 5 miles home from work for my exercise. I wore both my Galaxy Watch 4 and apple watch 7. Keep in mind before I left, I topped off my GW4 til it was at 100%, something I could not do with my apple watch since I do not have a spare charger at work like I do with my Samsung watches, which seem to need it more often. I will stipulate that after a few weeks using my GW4 the battery life improved significantly as it \"learned\" my habits and adjusted accordingly. I used GPS on both to keep track of my walk, and listened to music downloaded to both watches and switched from one to the other exactly at the half-way point to make it fair. By the time I reached home, my GW4 was down to 61%. Now keep in mind I had been using my apple watch since 5am that morning and wasn't able to charge it before leaving for home. When I hit home my apple watch 7 was still at 79%. That is astonishing to me...and an enormously HUGE difference. I have suspected the battery life was better, but not by THAT much. I just looked it up, and the 45mm apple Watch 7 has a battery size of 309 mAh, while the GW4 has a battery size of 361 mAh. Sorry, but this is a GINORMOUS apple win here. It seems every other review I read about the newest apple watch, one of the chief complaints is battery life, but when compared to the GW4, I cannot help but be happy with it's performance so far. After having used the apple watch for over a week, using the GW4 reminded me (again) that Wear OS just isn't quite there yet. The crazy glitches that plague this system, the incessant notification of voicemail that is NEVER there 100% of the time whenever I turn the watch off and turn it back on again, the notification that my watch is playing media that isn't there, or that it's paired with a kindle that I have never paired it with, the slowness of opening apps and closing them again, the problem of pulling down the settings menu and how it works about half the time I try to pull it down, or scroll up working only part of the time, or how I close all apps only to discover some still open - apps I've never tried to open since the day I bought my watch...the list goes on and on. You know what glitches I've had with the apple watch? NONE. Seriously. I haven't had one single hiccup since I turned this device on. I truly wished this were not the case with my Samsung. The honest truth is I wouldn't even have an apple watch were it not for my sour experience with the newest Galaxy Watch. I still hope that a future update will correct most of these problems, and if so, I will be thrilled to see them implemented and will gladly state so. Problem is, I don't think this is Samsung's problem, it's an issue with Wear OS and Samsung can only do so much to correct it. I DO find it interesting that my older TicWatch Pro 3 has shown far fewer issues and glitches than the GW4 in pretty much every situation...so maybe its a combination of Wear OS and Samsung's version of Wear OS 3.0. Either way, I've been very disappointed in my experience and wish that they had never switched from Tizen in the first place. Oh well. Time will tell if Wear OS can correct these issues or not.", "The body composition feature is cool on the GW4. I really thought it would be more useful, though. I suppose it can be, but - for me at least - it simply hasn't been something that I've been able to get any kind of genuine use out of. Reportedly it can actually measure your blood pressure...but on a watch? I honestly cannot see how accurate that could be using any kind of method the way the watch is set up. Every reputable medical site I have looked at says the tech is far too new and simply isn't capable - yet anyway - of accurately being able to measure blood pressure monitoring. Kudos to Samsung for initiating it, but at this point, I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock on accuracy.", "Charging...so, since this is my first apple watch, I can't compare it's supposedly 33% faster charging over previous models...but I WILL say it's faster than the Galaxy Watch 4, 3, Original Galaxy Watch etc. and my TicWatch Pro 3...however, I have an Oppo Watch (which was clearly a ripoff of the apple watch design, but in their defense, they did a STELLAR job with it), now that watch charges FAST. Exactly how much faster, I cannot say for certain, but let's just say all of those other models I mentioned pale in comparison. I just find it absurd that apple did not include a charging block. An utterly imbecilic decision.\n"]},

What am I doing installing a pedometer app?  This seemed like buying an iPhone and having to install a phone app.  If you know the watch OS, I hope it wouldn't take you that long to set this up just the way you want it, but I didn't have the patience.  I think I got the number of steps to display but then there wasn't a place to put the heart rate.  I expected less hassle for this simple function.", "I opened the iPhone Watch app.  I'm sure there is a way to get it out of the Settings screen, but at this point, as I was about to refresh my perception of how this app wasn't that easy to use, I can't get it to do anything except alter various settings.  I can't back out of the Settings into the program itself.  I've only been using computers since 1982 or so, when I studied assembly language on a machine with 1K Ram and cassette tape instead of a hard drive, so it could be that I'm not capable of figuring out how to operate the easy to use Apple software interface.", "I even have an Apple Watch for Dummies book, the latest edition.  I ended up looking online for solutions to problems as they came up because for me the book was full of a lot of tips and info except no info on the particular problem, whatever it was, that I had.", "Apple doesn't even consider the type of exercise that I am doing at the moment, i.e. fairly gentle walking coming back from a serious heart issue, as exercise.  So they program their software out of the box to ignore the type of walking I do, so people say.  Maybe the watch can be tweaked or if I muttered the right incantation it might decide my walks are exercise,  but as I looked for info on how to make the watch display information about my proposed walks, the first warnings I ran into were that walks are not exercise in the Apple ecosystem unless they are of a certain intensity.  I don't know because I couldn't set up the watch well enough to even take it for a walk before I gave up and told my wife, who gave it to me as a present, that I was going to send it back.", "The screen is beautiful.

{"profile-name": "adandelion4you", "review-star-rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  As already posted in previous reviews, this watch doesn\u2019t come with the usb c brick that you need to charge it, so buy yourself one when you order your new watch.

That being said, it\u2019s a wonderful watch. It came in sealed, Apple packaging. The watch box was sealed on both ends. I mention this because of a few other reviews that complain of unsealed packaging and missing items. It has many features and I love that the health app integrates with the watch and you can view all of the data collected by the watch there. I ordered and received the 41mm. I\u2019m a woman and I find that an adequate size for my wrist and I\u2019m actually glad that I didn\u2019t get the 45mm because it would have been too big and I\u2019m not a dainty female with a small wrist.

I\u2019ve been eying the Series 7 for awhile as I had a Series 5 for a year and a half so I finally upgraded. I enjoy the slightly bigger screen, and brighter dispay along with better charging speeds and being able to use my old case and bands is a big plus in my book. To me it\u2019s not much of an upgrade but you\u2019re coming from a Series 3 and below then the upgrades will be major. People that complain about not having a charging brick in the box need to read the description as the description clearly says it doesn\u2019t come with one so why complain about something that you should\u2019ve known from the get go? They should do better research on what they buy next time and plus if you bought a new smart phone or even tablet within the last few years you should have a spare USB C charging brick laying around if not just suck it up and buy one Apple doesn\u2019t include one so it can save on waste and declutters their packaging. The USB C Apple Watch cable allows the Series 7 to charge faster so I rather have a cable that allows me to charge my watch faster just in case if I forget to charge my watch or if I\u2019m having a jam packed day ahead of me and need to charge it as much as I can so I can either get my day started or continue my day.\n"]},

{"profile-name": "Pyewacket", "review-star-rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  I have given this a lower rating of 2 because of Apple's stupidity. The watch itself is fine and should be rated higher. However, on the 7-series and on the latest iPad's, Apple has changed the charging cord on both ends. Both the insert connector to the power source and the connector to the watch (iPad) are different from previous versions and are not compatible with previous chargers. The power source can no longer be a USB port as the connector doesn't fit. And old charging cords cannot be used as they don't fit the iWatch or the iPad. This means you have to have double sets of chargers around, including automobile charges It is very annoying and irritating. Why did Apple do this?", "In addition, I unplug the charger from my iPad at my own peril. When I reconnect it it doesn't always start charging. I have to fiddle with the connections on both ends, and even the AC adapter until it starts charging. This makes me leery about removing the charger to take the iPad elsewhere. It is not the cords or AC adapter as two sets do the same thing.", "Is it just me or do others feel that Apple has gone downhill since Steve Jobs is not longer there.\n"]},

In fact its my first watch of any kind for a few years. I tried the cellular version and then returned it a few weeks ago for the GPS only version. Primary goal of the cellular was to free myself from carrying my phone whilst going running. too many subscription based apps, however, made this impractical, so the data plan wasn't really of much use. Plus it chews through more battery (more on that later). So yeah I think the tech ability  is finally here but Apple's ecosystem isn't very friendly to bundling your own playlists, so I continue to run with my phone AND watch AND bt headphones. Boo. Friggin. Who.", "I am guessing the white band of the Starlight model probably turns a lot of people off, but you should know that bands are really easy to change, and cheap on the after market. I love the look of the starlight watch frame with a colored band. it gives the watch both the ability to be uniquely fun but can also have a more conservative look with a gun metal grey band.", "The touch features are fantastic, as are the health features like vital signs. I've compared them to a real pulse oximeter and the o2 readouts are within 1% every time. Even the EKG sinus rhythm appears quite similar to a 12 lead. Remember, though, that this feature will not reliably detect (rule out) a heart attack.", "Usability is quite good, also. the mini keyboard is surprisingly easy to use. Sure its not your phone, but it gets the job done. Voice to text is great and I find myself using that more than the keyboard. After about a week it primarily becomes just a time piece on your wrist as the novelty wears off, but appreciable features include the ability to glance at texts without pulling out my phone, and the flashlight feature is very handy as well.", "there are a number of plastic/rubber covers on the market. I bought a two pack for use when i'll be out in the yard or an area where the watch may see more abuse. its more difficult to apply than changing the bands, which must come off to apply a protective cover. The screen naturally looses a small degree of touch sensitivity but is still quite usable. Mostly I go about my business without the cover. the 7 purportedly has a more durable screen and in a few months of use now I've yet to scratch it.", "My biggest complaint, other than the music options for going running, is the battery life. I find myself charging it two or three times a day. Not that it needs that many top offs, but I don't like seeing any battery dip below 50%. the nice thing is that the charge is quite quick and painless with the so-called hockey puck.

It's hard to justify this purchase price for marginal improvements from earlier iterations.  The Corporate Greed stinks, with their ruse of changing the prior iteration of charger to a USB system, so you need to purchase new stuff all around.  Yes, they include the cable with the USB-C, but the CHEAPOS don't include the plug.  Further, the one I received a couple weeks ago has been having non-stop charging issues and the battery life has been POOR.  Count on spending another $100 if you want the authentic plug and a second set.

Okay no IT doesn\u2019t come with a 9.99 block to usb-c. Big deal. If you can spend $400 bucks on a watch I think we can get that piece. It DOES come with the magnetic charger super fast charge chord that is $30 bucks. Also this watch syncs perfectly fine. I\u2019ve bought 3 so far. For people that claim to be tech savvy but took 6 hours? I\u2019m pretty with it still but other than saying did I want to sync it to my phone AFTER updating the phone it was fine. You buy a tech wifi product and it\u2019s going to need updates but other than it telling and showing you how to sync up your phone there\u2019s literally nothing to this. I bought it for my 82 year old mother . Showed her in minutes how to take an ECG, and pulse ox. Send a message, make a call, talk to Siri, set an appointment , reminder, alarm, Use the calendar , Set and measure her activity and set her ICE so if she falls and doesn\u2019t get up the phone will contact us. For what it is and all it\u2019s features , ease of use, this thing is amazing. I bought it on the $349. Price which really is pretty remarkable for all of it\u2019s features. Lot\u2019s of complaining here for something that\u2019s a pretty amazing and bonus with an emergency alert for her to get help. I\u2019m not sure how much people feel is okay to pay for all of this but for me it\u2019s one of my favorite things and seeing my moms face light up and marvel over this thing makes me say it\u2019s money well spent. Apple is a business, so is Verizon, Cable companies , service providers any many other monthly expenses that overcharge and don\u2019t include all the accessories you need either. Apps are also money makers but some of them make our lives convenient. Go on you tube and look up how to set up your phones/watches. It shouldn\u2019t take anyone 6 hours.

{"profile-name": "W. Herman", "review-star-rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  The iOS is horrible, frustrating, and counter intuitive. Want a stopwatch? Not on this device! Oh it has a stopwatch that is useless garbage. After one minute, the only thing it displays is 1:\u2014:\u2014. What genius thought of this? It\u2019s not saving battery, the display is still on! You can raise your wrist and the numbers appear, but if I have a heavy dumbbell in my hand or I\u2019m stabilizing it in my lap, I can\u2019t move my wrist. Just have the flipping numbers on screen!! FFS. Do you want to know what minute you\u2019re on after 70 seconds? Tough sh**, the screen switches to the time. So now you\u2019re forced to bring up your wrist. And yes, I\u2019ve looked up and changed every setting possible. Nothing I do prevents this. Well, why don\u2019t you download a third part app? Hey, let\u2019s try that. That was a massive headache itself and after I finally did download a third party stopwatch app that showed all of the numbers, the amazing, intuitive Apple iOS darkens and reverts to the time. Un-flipping-believable. Want to turn that setting off? Tough sh**, Mr. Customer, you can only look at the app for 70 seconds, so screw your three minute timer, peasant. \u201cWhat you need to do is toggle the hide sensitive complications options on or off.\u201d Guess what, that doesn\u2019t work. Not after 70 seconds. While I\u2019m talking about the display, sometimes an app view screen shows up randomly and I literally can\u2019t do anything to get out of it. The only option I have is to turn it off and back on again. That\u2019s extremely frustrating. Also, they need to figure out which direction the scroll when is used for. One screen the scroll wheel moves the screen in the direction you push the wheel (up is up and down is down), but when you go to move the cursor to edit text, down on the wheel moves the cursor up. Why? Why would they do this? Well we\u2019re on the subject of text, the talk to text on this watch is atrocious. I can say the exact same thing on my iPhone and it works great. The watch simply does a turd job at understanding talk to text. When I do scroll down to go up and select a word to change it to something that I actually said instead of what it wrote, the options simply aren\u2019t there. Ever. Also, when I\u2019m on the workout app tracking my heart rate and I switch to a Stopwatch app to track my time in between sets, I looked down at my watch to check the time and it switched back to the workout app! That\u2019s so extremely frustrating. When I switch to another app I want to look at that flipping app. I don\u2019t want you to change to the time, I don\u2019t want you to change apps regardless of what you think I want to see. It\u2019s little stuff like this that makes me want to ask, will it blend? Sometimes I think putting it down the garbage disposal or in a Vitamix would make me much happier due to the frustration I have with the iOS. What stops me from doing that? The hardware. The hardware is really amazing. I love the way it feels in my wrist, I love the heart rate monitor which never drops my heart rate (unlike every Fitbit or Mio watch I\u2019ve had). The screen is fantastic, the haptics are really nice and not overbearing. For the amount that this thing cost the fact that the software is so crippling there\u2019s no way I can recommend someone purchase this until they get the iOS fixed.\n"]},

Sit very steady in my ears and don't feel like they will come out at all.  Ears a bit sore after taking them out but I think that is getting used to them a bit. Will see how that goes. Like how easily they pair with a device (iPad, Apple TV, iMac) as you switch devices.  It would have been nice to have a volume up/down on it vs having to control that by the phone, tv,etc.  When using for telephone use, the other party said they sounded fine and I could hear them fine.  Definitely no noise cancellation - outside noises are all there (which is a safe thing in a way), but on a plane, train - would not be good - you would need the Pro's for that.

I could leave the AP1 and AP2 in my ears all day and I would essentially forget that they were there.

I want all the features of these but they are a bigger fit than Gen 2 or actually even the Pro.  We were able to compare them since each of my daughters have the other versions. This by far are fat and loose, so not as trustworthy that you won't lose them. Especially during this winter and with mask around the ear, they could easy fall or get caught up in your scarf and you won't know it until it's too late.  True any can fall but unless you have deep ears these are just too easy. Nope too expensive to lose like that so I got rid of them.

{"profile-name": "Buu", "review-star-rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  Sound is great on these and visually with the shorter stem they look good.  The issue is the controls on the AirPods themselves, with the 2nd gen you can skip tracks by double tapping on the outside of the AirPod so it stays in your ear, but with these (and the Pro) you have to hold the bottom of the stem in a certain indented spot to skip tracks.  This is an issue as the AirPods fall out each time I touch them.  My work out gloves get in the way as well, I hated it and will be returning.  If you don\u2019t use your AirPods in this way (I.e use your Apple Watch to control music) then these are great but if you use this functionality like I do at the gym, on planes, etc. you will not enjoy this experience.

Both the headphones themselves and the case are super easy to go anywhere with. My old wireless earbuds were way too large of a case to fit in my pocket, whereas these feel like they could actually properly replace my wired earbuds due to their (shockingly compact) form-factor. I can get my phone and earbuds in one pocket, or my wallet/keys/earbuds in one pocket and my phone in the other, which is very nice. Tie in the wireless charging making it easy to keep my phone and headphones charged (though I've never come close to running them dry), and they work pretty well. But...", "For how expensive they are I am going to critique them much harder than my last set of wireless earbuds (which were $40 and sound better than these). I primarily use these for working out, and while they are resistant to sweat it does make them slide out incredibly easily for me. That generally is my biggest complaint of all, the fit in the ear. I get you can't design a hard-shell for every ear, but I found the old design much more reliable than these, and also much easier to clean (the angle makes wax stuck in the crevice hard to get at). This is probably the most annoying aspect of the earphones by far since I bought them to work out in, and I constantly have to worry about them popping out, breaking, and having wasted the better part of $300.", "Likewise I have a few other complaints:", "- The actuation doesn't activate properly for controls when I have chalk on my hands all the time.", "- Generally one-ear listening is very unergonomic with constant pairing abnormalities (going from paired to not paired), not to mention switching to one ear listening from two ears is a pain in the ass because your music pauses (they could fix this by having music restart when the other ear is back in the case)", "- The actuation feels weird with the haptics. Specifically because it is (I assume) force touch haptics you don't actually feel like it's clicking, but there is a slight audio cue that often gets drowned out by music and makes it hard to tell if you've hit it", "- The fact that many of the features (adaptive eq, spatial audio [which I personally think is garbage anyways], and the more reliable h1 pairing) are not actually features of the headphones, but rather IOS features that these happen to implement since they stop working on android", "- The price is insane for the actual quality of the sound in the headphones. Overall they sound *fine*, but again for nearly $300 I would like more than fine", "So overall, if you happen to fit them well they're alright. They really are good as a pair of daily driving headphones with the form factor. Every other wireless pair of earphones I would not bother to take around with me, and would just use when working out cause of how bulky they are.  If you're on android be aware they will sound worse than the already mediocre sound they have on IOS (VERY open-back and pretty flat), and if that doesn't bother you fire away Just wait for a sale or buy them second hand cause they are not worth the insane cost..\n"]},

With Google being idiots and halting development in the tablet space after the failed Pixel tablet 2 years ago, it appeared that Apple was my only option for a high-end tablet.", "This 4th-gen Ipad Air is a real treat. It has the same A14 Bionic Chip that's on the iPhone 12 flagship, which means it's one of the fastest ARM-based tablets in existence right now. It's arguably better than even the Ipad Pro, since it's on a more power-efficient 5nm process, so it's a better choice until they refresh the Pro next year. This new Ipad is incredibly snappy, and has no problem running graphically intensive mobile games or doing video encoding with ease. Unlike past Ipad Airs, this tablet provides great value and is a serious contender to the Pro at half the cost, while still maintaining a decent screen size at right under 11\".", "IOS 14 is still missing a few key features only available in Android, but I think for most people it will be more than sufficient for most common tasks. My main complaints are the lack of notification toolbars like in Android, which allow for powerful shortcuts using IFTTT and other protocols within quick reach. Additionally, adblock support is still limited to plugins for Safari, and utilizing a DNS-based approach. DNS will work system-wide, but only works on your local WiFi network and not over a cellular network. It also misses some types of encrypted ads that are becoming more commonplace these days. It's too bad that Apple limits actual adblock plugins to Safari, as I much prefer using Chrome, but it's better than nothing. IOS is also still quite locked down, and I doubt that IOS 14 on the new Bionic Chip will be jailbroken anytime soon if at all, so modding is still very limited. That means no transferring of save games between Game Apps that have a Windows or Android counterpart, and limited support for gaming emulators, though quite a few are available which do not require root access.\n"]},
{"profile-name": "JP", "review-star-rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  Finally decided to upgrade and bought the new iPad Air 4th generation. What a POS. Like another review mentioned, the battery life was not as advertised, used it for 3 hours and battery power was down to less than 30%. Would need to charge this thing multiple times a day if I were to keep it. Also, it would not let me set my password preferences, there was no check mark to indicate I was making a change, and then after asking for my password after EVERY song I tried to download in 5 min, then it mysteriously stopped accepting my password. Couldn't change preferences. Spent a total of 4 hrs on the phone with Apple support, (2 hrs one day, 2 hrs the next) and got transfered to total of 6 different people,including senior managers.  I was told It was a software problem, NOT a hardware issue and thus the iPad was fine.  Did a total reset 3 times, last time hooked up to a computer, reinstalled the software and.....still nothing. Same problem continued.  I returned it today and was told there are no more available ( of the one I want).  Meanwhile my 1st gen iPad Air is still working beautifully.  Apple has really gone downhill. So frustrating!!!\n"]},

I\u2019ll most likely keep using that for reading. Occasionally read on iPad Air. Mostly draw on there. Lol the iPad feels like a bit of overkill for my needs.

I'm not going to mess around with lightening connectors.  I do feel like though you could combine the capabilities of a MacBook Air/ or 13 pro with touch. I know there are some issues with where to place the speakers, charge a bit more and make a 2-1 device, like the surface.

But this tablet has to sacrifice some features, especially the 120HZ refresh rate, and Face ID to keep cost low but it\u2019s something that the average consumer, student, or a business person wouldn\u2019t care about, unless your an artist, a creator, or someone in the designing industry, then I would say an iPad Pro is necessary purchase to make if you're career requires the higher refresh rate and the higher GPU processing for graphic designing, video editing, or creativity.", "Otherwise this tablet is perfect for anything from entertainment to web surfing, I even took notes with the Logitech crayon, even with the lower refresh it\u2019s not the top of the line in class, but for my needs, it works just perfectly.

So I already came into this one expecting some good improvements, but did not expect it to be something pretty great.

I was torn between the iPad Pro 11 and this new Air. The air, as far as internal specs, matches and even out performs a little than the iPad Pro 11, so with the lower price point, I figured why not. But man, hands down, this thing is pretty awesome. It feels great, with the square off edges, the thin bezels giving way to more screen real estate, and of course as mentioned, the performance. I was pretty pleased with the decision. But wait.. there\u2019s more.. lol.", "I decided to splurge on the steep price tag for Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard, which fits the Pro 11\u201d and this Air.

Paired with a super easy magnetic pad to quickly place your iPad on and off. This thing is just next level. I find myself rarely reaching for my MacBook or getting on the desktop iMac. The USB-C\u2019s versatility when paired with devices that can either output to HDMI, input SD cards, or utilize various different interface devices, this thing\u2019s a power house.", "For me, it works and then some. Only drawback is if you\u2019re someone that wants the bigger screen, at 11\u201d this is more than what I need for what I use it for. Other than that, I can\u2019t think of anything negative. Sure you could argue it\u2019s still using the Touch ID technology, albeit a much better improved version and it being on the power key to get rid of the old middle circle button, you may miss out on the Face ID apple offers in it\u2019s Pro models.

The screen is 0.1 inches short of 11 inches, so it's not really noticeable in use unless you compare it side-by-side to the pro. The Apple Pencil works flawlessly. I did have to update to get the double tap feature to work. Please note, THE Apple Pencil DOES NOT COME WITH THE iPAD. I got mine customized from apple. The performance is very snappy and the battery life will last you almost all day depending on how much you use it and what you use it for. Switching out the proprietary Lightning port for a USB-C one was a great improvement, as now you are able to use USB-C Hubs and other connectors. The TouchID sensor in the top button recognizes my finger instantly. The iPad goes great with a wireless keyboard and mouse for typing anywhere you don't have access to a laptop or desktop.

Yes, I wanted the pastel colors since they're so brilliant but I figured if I can get some money off why not take the leap of faith and buy the regular old space grey? It arrived a lot sooner at my house then expected which was extremely pleasant. It is 10.9 inches as advertised, I got the 256 gb version since I am an artist, gamer, movie watcher and reader. I like to store a bunch of stuff on my ipad. This goes anywhere from art books/tutorials, videos, music, games, and all the good stuff the ipad is capable of doing. It's super light and very fragile looking so I put it into a case almost immediately. I also bought the apple pencil to boot. I am coming from upgrading the 2017 12.9 inch ipad so I downsized when I made this purchase. I really wanted a small computer to draw on and carry with me and this fit the budget and the need. If you haven't bought an ipad before or are considering upgrading don't hesitate. Buy it now! The color of the tech doesn't really matter once you have a case on so I didn't really whine too much about the loss of color. So far I've been really enjoying the quality of the product. Everything from the display colors (pure brilliance) to the ease and speed of utilizing the higher end technical features of the product has been a blast. Thank you Apple for making such an awesome product and Amazon for the incredible sale.\n"]},

This is the best I have used for working out and activities, so I put up with it.  If I am wanting to really listen to music, I am using a different pair or my Sennheiser earphones.

I'm in the process of buying all of the apple goodies! I got a FANTASTIC deal on a pair of these at Fred Meyer so I decided to pull the trigger. I see almost everybody walking around with a pair of Airpods. I didn't understand the hype until now! These earbuds are AMAZING to say the least! I currently use a set of Sony WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones. I wanted a comfortable earbud that matched or exceeded the amount of ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) that the Sony's offer. these Airpod pros do just that! the first thing I noticed when I put them in was the ANC. with just ANC on with no music the background noise is muffled pretty well. Once you get some music playing, outside noises cease to exist! the call quality is fantastic and I'm a huge fan of their slim size! My only complaint so far is how they tend to slowly slip out of my ear over time. due to this I always have to re-adjust them. this problem is easily fixed with a different set of ear tips made out of a less slippery material. as for the battery life, It's pretty decent for what your getting. I can get about 4 hours or so of listening time WITH ANC on before I have to recharge them. the case charges them up in a jiff and I'm back in business! the case allows me to get through my entire workday and both commutes with some gas left in the tank. I have yet to fully drain the case. all in all, I am very happy with these. I know that the sony WF-1000XM3 buds edge the pros out ever so slightly but I think the Sleek look and portable size make these superior!\n"]},

These are the first earbuds I\u2019ve owned with spatial surround sound and it makes watching TV more enjoyable. Apple added a button on the stem of each earbud instead of touch controls which I like. I find when having to adjust earbuds in my ears touch controls can be easily pressed by accident. It happens much less with these. The sound quality, I could go either way on. Yes they sound good and clear and there\u2019s some bass there. But I wish you had more control, an EQ within an app or something.", " Cons. There really aren\u2019t many. They could use more bass. I was surprised your not able to control the volume from the earbuds themselves unless you use Siri. The ANC is ok but not much better than some generic earbuds I\u2019ve tried.", "  Overall, I\u2019d definitely recommend them to Apple users. Because all of Apple\u2019s products work flawlessly together. I don\u2019t think they are the best out there but there good.

{"profile-name": "Jesse Mitchell", "review-star-rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "review-body": ["\n  They are easy to use, comfortable, and sound quality is good, but I bought these specifically for the noise cancelling feature.  When I first bought them I was absolutely in love with them.  The noise cancellation was unbelievable!  I have a loud car and when I put these in (while parked) I could not hear my car at all.  However, with each forced firmware update the noise cancellation got progressively worse.  I tried different tips that were supplied thinking that I needed a different size, that didn't work.  I then bought two different sets of tips off of Amazon (including the Comply Foam Tips) and the noise cancelling was still awful.  The newest firmware update, made the noise cancellation virtually obsolete!  So, I gave these to my daughter and bought an $80 pair of ANC earbuds off of Amazon and they blow these away!  My only guess is that Apple is trying to improve battery life by sacrificing ANC, but that is only a guess.  If you want these for other reasons, besides ANC, go for it I guess or just buy the base AirPods and save some money.  But, know that Apple is apparently messing with the ANC on these because a simple web search shows I am not the only one experiencing this issue.

After using the Sony WF-1000XM4\u2019s these are absolute garbage. The Noise canceling shouldn\u2019t even be considered as such. It canceled out MAYBE 20% of the outside noise, where the Sony\u2019s create absolute silence for peaceful listening. The AirPods Pros do not sound any better than the regular AirPods. The only thing I see good about these is convenience, and for some, \u201cstatus\u201d or \u201cflexing\u201d on others who can\u2019t afford them.

I've had it for several weeks and absolutely love it.", "Data transfer from my old iPad to the new was an absolute breeze, and within 15 minutes, I was using the new Air. I now have twice the storage (64gb), more RAM, and everything loads in remarkably fast. The screen display is markedly better and watching a video on it is simply amazing. I'm still convinced I wouldn't have noticed any difference (or not enough of one) to justify the extra money for a Pro.", "Apple is launching a new iPad Air in March or April, but it doesn't have enough new bells and whistles on it to be worth waiting for so I chose to buy an \"older model\" which was still a huge upgrade and have no regrets.", "I had a few Android devices maybe 10 years ago or so, and I will never go back.
